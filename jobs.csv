**Company** 




 TAbot is an AI\\-powered technical accounting assistant built for CFOs, controllers, and finance leaders. We simplify complex workflows like contract review, compliance research, and audit\\-ready documentation — delivering results that meet IPO standards. We're a small, high\\-conviction team building enterprise software at the intersection of AI, accounting, and security.
 



  





**The Role** 




 We're looking for a founding engineer who is primarily a
 **backend and security AI engineer** 
 who can also ship frontend when needed. Our founder handles frontend — so this role is about owning everything behind the UI: the server, the infrastructure, the security posture, and the deployment pipeline.
 



 This is not a frontend role. Do not apply if your primary strength is UI/UX or frontend frameworks.
 



  





**What You'll Own** 



* Design and build backend systems in
 **Python (Flask)** 
 — APIs, data pipelines, integrations
* Implement and maintain
 **security controls** 
 : RBAC, encryption, audit trails, secrets management, input validation, and vulnerability remediation
* Own the
 **deployment pipeline** 
 : Dockerized services, CI/CD, environment management, and production reliability
* Harden infrastructure for
 **SOC 2 compliance** 
 and enterprise customer requirements
* Work directly with the founders to ship new product modules end\\-to\\-end
* Make sound architectural trade\\-offs in a fast\\-moving, zero\\-to\\-one environment



  





**Hard Requirements — Do Not Apply Without These** 



* 3\\-5 years of full\\-stack engineering experience (backend\\-heavy)
* **Python and Flask** 
 as your primary backend stack — Node.js/Express experience does not substitute
* **Production security experience** 
 : you have personally implemented security controls, not just read about them — RBAC, encryption at rest/transit, audit logging, secure SDLC
* **Docker** 
 in production — you've built, deployed, and debugged Dockerized systems
* Experience owning CI/CD pipelines and deployments, not just writing application code
* Strong written and spoken English — you'll communicate directly with a US\\-based founder and enterprise customers



  





**Strong Plus** 



* **AI application development** 
 : experience building and shipping AI\\-powered products — RAG pipelines, LLM integration, prompt engineering, vector databases, or embedding workflows
* Proficiency with
 **AI\\-assisted development tools** 
 (Cursor, Copilot, etc.) — we move fast and expect you to leverage these effectively
* Exposure to SOC 2–aligned environments or InfoSec frameworks
* AWS infrastructure experience
* Vercel deployment experience
* Experience integrating with enterprise systems (CRMs, ERPs, accounting platforms)
* Background in or exposure to finance/accounting software



  





**What Makes This Different** 



* You will own security architecture from day one
* Direct access to founders, real enterprise customers from week one
* High autonomy — no ticket queues, no micromanagement
* Build something that genuinely matters to finance teams preparing for IPO



  





**We are not looking for someone who wants stability.** 
 We want someone who takes pride in shipping secure, reliable systems and wants to grow with the company.
 



  





**Compensation** 
**₹28–42 LPA** 
 depending on experience and demonstrated security/AI expertise. Long\\-term collaboration preferred.

 a short intro and your resume
