* Prepare cost estimates, project budgets, and resource allocation plans.
* Coordinate with project managers, clients and other stakeholders to ensure project requirements are met.
* Coordination and technical leadership in the delivery of HV transmission line engineering and design projects/packages.
* Developing transmission line alignments, profiles, and structure spotting using PLS\\-CADD.
* Performing sag\\-tension analysis and validating clearances in accordance with relevant standards (e.g. EN 50341, NG TS 2\\.04\\).
* Preparing and reviewing design deliverables including plan/profile drawings, stringing charts, structure schedules, and loading reports.
* Assessing tower and pole structure loading and coordinating foundation designs with geotechnical inputs.
* Leading and/or contributing to the following project types:
* New transmission line designs (greenfield)
* Reconductoring and sag\\-tension recalculations
* Uprating and clearance improvement studies
* Structure/pole strength assessments and retrofits
