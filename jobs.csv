* TimeBack: An educational platform supporting Alpha School's 2\\-hour learning model (achieving 99th percentile test outcomes).
* Incept: A content generation platform producing all customized educational materials for various learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
* Crossover: An AI\\-driven hiring platform managing tens of thousands of candidates monthly, staffing educational institutions and organizations worldwide.


 You will take ownership of one platform and dedicate the majority of your time to constructing the most complex components of the codebase with a compact team (3\\-5 accomplished engineers, no junior members). The architectural choices you make will dictate whether other teams can quickly develop new applications, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Sound decisions create massive leverage. Poor ones generate integration chaos and destroy velocity across multiple teams.
   

  

 You design what you build and operate. You define quality standards and technical patterns for your platform. We follow a spec\\-driven approach: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. Expect high autonomy, zero committees, and no approval boards. You work within a small, cohesive team where accountability for what you ship rests with you.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Define strategic architectural choices and set technical patterns for the team.
* AI Leadership: Champion new AI workflows and develop high\\-value playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the complex, mission\\-critical portions of the codebase with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify that your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality benchmarks.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Functioning as an architect who does not write code
* Spending time in continuous meetings
* Managing personnel (this is a technical leadership position, not a people management role)
* Maintaining legacy systems or internal IT infrastructure


**Basic Requirements**
**Senior Software Architect key responsibilities**
* A minimum of 5 years of professional software development experience creating software products
* At least 3 years serving as either a lead engineer (conducting code reviews) or architect (determining critical technical direction)
* Background working on platform\\-level products where your APIs were consumed by other teams
* Demonstrated commitment to AI tools, consistently experimenting and exploring their limits


**About LearnWith.AI**
 LearnWith.AI is an edtech startup that leverages AI and subject matter experts to cultivate a new way of learning. Our unique approach leverages 50\\+ years of learning science, cutting\\-edge data analytics and AI\\-powered coaching. In doing so, we can help students learn more, learn faster, and learn better \\- and have fun while doing it. We are a remote\\-first company that hires globally via Crossover.
   

  

 There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!
   

  

**Working with us**
 This is a full\\-time (40 hours per week), long\\-term position. The position is immediately available and requires entering into an independent contractor agreement with Crossover as a Contractor of Record. The compensation level for this role is $100 USD/hour, which equates to $200,000 USD/year assuming 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. The payment period is weekly.
