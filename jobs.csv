**About the Role** 




 We are seeking a highly skilled and motivated AI Engineer to join our innovative team at B\\-MEC IMAGING, dedicated to advancing healthcare through technology. The successful candidate will be responsible for designing, building, and deploying scalable Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models that directly impact patient care, diagnostics, and clinical efficiency. This is a critical, high\\-stakes role that demands expertise in the full ML lifecycle alongside a deep commitment to data privacy, clinical safety, and regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA, FDA, DEKRA). You will transform complex clinical data into actionable intelligence, working collaboratively with clinicians and data scientists to bring validated, reliable AI solutions from research to the patient bedside.
 



 Key Responsibilities
 


* Design and Development: • Design, develop, and implement robust and scalable Machine Learning (ML) models and deep learning algorithms to solve complex clinical problems by helping in bringing, clinical workflow efficiency, enabling smart hospital solutions and AI assisted decisions support. • Work with large, complex datasets, DICOM images, ensuring data integrity and preparing it for modelling.• Design, develop, and implement highly accurate and robust Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning models for specific medical applications (e.g., diagnostic imaging analysis, predictive models for patient risk, natural language processing for clinical notes).• Focus on developing algorithms that offer high sensitivity and specificity relevant to clinical needs.
* Data Handling and Preprocessing: Work extensively with specialized medical data types, including DICOM images (MRI, CT scans, X\\-rays), EHR (Electronic Health Record) data, genomic sequences, and time\\-series physiological signals. Ensure rigorous data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction from complex, often noisy, clinical datasets.
* Safety, Reliability, and Explainability: Develop models with inherent mechanisms for safety checks and failure modes appropriate for clinical use. Prioritize Model Explainability (XAI) to provide clinically relevant interpretations of model predictions, ensuring transparency for physicians (e.g., using techniques like SHAP or LIME).
* Compliance and Regulatory Standards: Integrate development practices that adhere strictly to medical regulatory standards, such as HIPAA/GDPR for patient data privacy and potentially FDA/CE Mark requirements for medical device software. Maintain detailed documentation of model validation, performance metrics, and data lineage to support regulatory submissions.
* Benchmarking and Clinical Validation: Rigorously benchmark model performance against established clinical standards or competing algorithms. Collaborate with clinicians and biostatisticians to design and execute clinical validation studies to demonstrate real\\-world utility and impact.



 Deployment and MLOps
 


* Production System Integration's Integrate validated models into clinical workflow systems, such as EHR platforms or PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems), ensuring seamless, low\\-latency performance in a hospital or diagnostic setting's Integrate ML models into production applications and systems, working closely with software development teams' Establish and maintain MLOps practices, including version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) for ML pipelines, and model monitoring.
* Safety\\-Critical MLOps Pipelines: (Good to have) , Design and implement robust MLOps pipelines that incorporate extra validation and approval gates specific to healthcare. This includes mandatory clinical review steps before model updates are pushed to production's Utilize version control for models, training data, and environment configurations to ensure full auditability and traceability, critical for regulatory compliance.• Continuous Monitoring and Validation: (Good to have)o Establish continuous monitoring systems that track model performance against clinical endpoints (e.g., false\\-negative rate for a diagnostic tool) rather than just technical metrics (e.g., AUC). Implement data drift detection and concept drift monitoring tailored to changes in patient populations, equipment updates, or diagnostic protocols, triggering alerts and automated retraining processes when performance degrades.• Optimization and Maintenance's Optimize models for performance, scalability, and efficiency (e.g., latency, throughput).o Monitor deployed models for drift, bias, and performance degradation, and retrain models, as necessary.
* Security and Privacy's Maintain strict adherence to data governance policies, implementing de\\-identification or pseudonymization techniques for sensitive patient data both during training and inference. ensure all data access and model endpoints are secured using industry\\-standard encryption and access controls to maintain HIPAA/GDPR compliance.



 Required Qualifications and Skills

 3 Months
 



**Location:** 
 Hyderabad, India
 



  





**About the Role** 




**We’re on the lookout for a Flutter Developer Intern** 
 who’s as excited about clean UI as they are about clean code. You’ll be part of a small team that moves fast, breaks things (responsibly), and builds apps that actually matter.
 



  





 This is an
 **onsite role in Hyderabad** 
 , so you’ll be working side\\-by\\-side with designers, developers, and dreamers who believe in shipping great products — not just slide decks.
 



  





**What You’ll Be Doing (aka your superpowers)** 



* Turning ideas into actual working apps using Flutter and Dart.
* Pairing up with designers to make sure pixels are in the right place.
* Debugging like Sherlock — no mystery bug goes unsolved.
* Helping shape features that people will actually use (and hopefully love).
* Learning, experimenting, and occasionally arguing about tabs vs spaces.



  





**Who You Are** 



* You’ve played around with Flutter and Dart, and you kind of love it.
* You know your way around REST APIs, Firebase, and Git.
* You’re curious, creative, and love figuring out how things work.
* You care about the details but also know when “done” is better than “perfect.”
* You want to learn from real projects — not just tutorials.



  





**What You’ll Get** 



* Real hands\\-on experience (no “shadowing” nonsense here).
* Mentorship from people who actually love what they do.
* A chance to turn this internship into a full\\-time gig if you crush it.
* Endless coffee, spontaneous brainstorming, and startup chaos (the fun kind).



  





 If you’ve built something cool in Flutter — even if it’s half\\-finished — we’d love to see it. Send your resume (and maybe a GitHub link) to
