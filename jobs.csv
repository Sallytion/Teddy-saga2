* Documentation and traceability: maintain checklists, test summaries, and a requirement to test to result traceability matrix. Keep artefacts inspection ready.
* Quality metrics: track pass rates, defect leakage, and re\\-open counts. Share simple weekly reports with owners and dates.
* Collaboration: work daily with Product, Engineering, QA peers, and Implementation to align scope, data, and timelines.
* Continuous improvement: prune flaky cases, tighten test data sets, and standardise reusable checklists.


 What You Bring
   

  

* Experience: 4 to 6 years in manual QA for fintech, payments, or high scale SaaS with multiple production releases.
* Test design mastery: boundary value, equivalence partitioning, state transition, risk based planning, and a tidy traceability matrix from requirement to result.
* API testing: hands on with Postman or SoapUI. You validate side effects with SQL basics and know how to isolate errors and edge cases.
* Data and environments: you craft realistic test data sets, manage sandboxes and certification flows, and use mocks or stubs when dependencies block testing.
* Defect hygiene: crisp steps to reproduce, logs and headers where needed, correct severity and priority, tight retest and closure.
* Collaboration: clear, concise status updates, ability to push back on unclear scope, and early escalation with options and impacts.
* Evidence discipline: checklists, summaries, and versioned artefacts that are audit ready.
* Tooling: Jira, Confluence, and a test case manager such as TestRail or Zephyr. Comfortable with basic Linux and reading service logs.


 Bonus Points
   

  

* Hybrid working model: In\\-office collaboration for design reviews, workshops, and team days, with flexible remote time for deep work. Clear expectations on core hours and availability.
* Ownership and growth: Small teams and direct access to decision makers. End\\-to\\-end responsibility for your area, support for certifications and learning, and progression based on outcomes.
