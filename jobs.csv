**Location:** 
 Chandigarh / Bangalore
 



**Job Type:** 
 Full \\-Time (Hybrid Mode)
 



  





 Sprouts.AI is an AI native “Generative Demand Platform” disrupting the $1\\.1T B2B GTM category. It helps B2B demand generation and sales teams generate qualified pipeline and increase deal conversion rates through real time account and contact level intelligence signals, recommending the next best actions and enabling execution via AI agents. We are solving the problem of inefficient GTM driven by dirty data ecosystems, multiple siloed legacy tools, large GTM teams, static ICPs and poorly defined segments. Current customers have seen a significant improvement in data coverage and quality, 3X increase in qualified leads, over 50% increase in SDR/BDR efficiency, and a 30%\\+ reduction in MarTech tool cost.
 



  





 We’re now expanding our AI engineering team with
 **Frontend and Full\\-Stack Engineers** 
 who are excited to build in an
 **AI\\-first way** 
 : coding
 *with* 
 AI (Cursor/Copilot/Agentic coding), Design using AI (Claude, Stitch, etc), shipping at speed, and wiring real GTM data into decision\\-making agents. If you want to own end\\-to\\-end features and move fast with AI as your co‑developer, this is for you.
 



  





  





**What you’ll own (outcomes, not tasks)** 



* **Design and build AI\\-native interfaces:** 
 Copilot\\-style UIs, dashboards, and interactive visualizations where users interact with agents in real time.
* **Integrate frontend with AI workflows:** 
 Connect UI events to backend agents, APIs, RAG pipelines, and LLM functions.
* **Full\\-stack shipping:** 
 Take a feature from idea → UI mock → backend integration → live deployment.
* **Iterate fast:** 
 Use AI tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.) to scaffold components, generate code, and prototype quickly.
* **Harden and refine:** 
 Add type safety, error boundaries, observability, and performance optimizations — without slowing iteration speed.



  





  





**Tech you’ll touch** 



* **Frontend:** 
 Next.js / React / Tailwind / TypeScript / Zustand or Redux.
* **Backend (for full\\-stack track):** 
 Node.js / Express / Python (FastAPI).
* **AI \\& orchestration:** 
 LangChain / LangGraph / LlamaIndex; REST \\+ WebSocket integrations with AI agents.
* **Design \\& visualization:** 
 Figma, Chart.js / Recharts, Framer Motion, Stitch
* **Infra:** 
 Docker / CI/CD pipelines, Azure, AWS



  





  





**Must\\-have skills (hard filters)** 



* **Excellent coding skills:** 
 Strong in JavaScript/TypeScript and modern React; comfortable writing clean, scalable, reusable, and performant code. For full\\-stack, command over Python would also be required.
* **AI\\-assisted coding mindset:** 
 You already code with tools like Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, or Aider daily.
* **Product sense:** 
 Understand UX patterns for AI copilots, conversational UIs, and interactive data products.
* **Prompting \\& communication:** 
 Can translate UX intent into effective prompts and communicate design trade\\-offs clearly. Ability to design effective prompts, collaborate through pair\\-prompting, and clearly communicate ideas and trade\\-offs with both humans and AI models.
* **Full\\-stack fluency (if applicable):** 
 Can write lightweight backend logic (Node.js, FastAPI) and integrate APIs or agent endpoints.
* **Shipping DNA:** 
 Portfolio of projects or demos built fast (hackathons, indie projects, OSS, etc.).



  





  





**Nice\\-to\\-haves** 



* Experience with
 **AI UI frameworks** 
 (e.g., Dust, Flowise, LangGraph UI, custom chat orchestration).
* Familiarity with
 **LLM\\-driven UX** 
 — chat, suggestion surfaces, auto\\-completions, or adaptive dashboards.
* Contributions to open source or hackathons that show design \\+ speed balance.
* Basic understanding of
 **Agentic workflows** 
 (so you can reason about frontend\\-backend interaction).



  





  





**You’ll thrive here if you…** 



* Reach for AI
 *before* 
 boilerplate; pair\\-prompt with teammates; write small design notes and iterate.
* Demo half\\-working things to get feedback; love “thin slice → ship → instrument → refine.”
* Treat data contracts/observability and eval based development as part of product quality, not “later.”



  





**Please don’t apply if…** 



* You want long upfront design cycles and weekly status over frequent demos.
* You avoid AI coding tools or see them as “cheating.”
* You only want research/papers, not product shipping.



  





  





**Hiring signals we look for** 



* Repos or demos of
 **Agentic** 
 and
 **AI native** 
 features (even rough).
* A story where you shipped in
 **48–72 hours** 
 with AI tools.
* Clearheaded trade\\-offs (latency vs. quality, retrieval vs. reasoning, eval cost vs. benefit).



**Anti\\-signals** 



* “I’ll build it all by hand first and automate later.”
* Over\\-indexing on framework dogma; refusal to instrument/evaluate.
* “Agents are magic” (no plan for tools, states, or recovery).



  





  





  





**What you’ll get** 



* Competitive salary and meaningful responsibility from day one in a high\\-trust, builder\\-led environment.
* Fast path to broader ownership and leadership for candidates who consistently ship and raise the bar.
* Direct collaboration with world\\-class founders, technologists, and AI leaders—exposure to cutting\\-edge thinking and mentorship.
* A chance to work on frontier problems in GTM and AI\\-native product design, where your work has immediate impact.
* Access to top\\-tier AI tooling, workflows, and a culture of experimentation and fast learning.
* An environment where demos, learning, and iteration are valued over bureaucracy and slow cycles.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprouts-ai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQESSbSS9h_-DQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1690372211580?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=VW1dwvZ5jRU9kaQzBDRjkXaE4vv_dVMJl6Jv8twvJXE","","","","","","","","","","",""
