 OpenTable is looking for a Senior Software Engineer Backend to join the rapidly\\-growing Restaurant Platform Team in India and help maintain our event\\-based architecture, data warehouse, data pipelines, reports \\& insights and APIs. This is a hands\\-on technical role with a dash of leadership and strategy.
   

  

 You'll be a key member of a multi\\-functional team that builds and designs OpenTable’s core reporting insights platform for restaurants globally and will have a substantial impact and involvement on some key enterprise strategies and initiatives. We are passionate about building small, independent product development teams – product managers, designers and engineers working together and empowered to make their own decisions.
   

  

 As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be responsible for technical and architectural decisions to ensure our platforms are scalable, highly available, reliable and have a high performance, especially under peak traffic spikes.
   

  

**About You**
 An ideal candidate should be an expert in Java and Spring Framework and extra points if you have experience with the technologies behind big data, data pipelines, data warehousing, analytics and designing event\\-driven, data\\-intensive architectures.

* You understand the best ways to build data pipelines to support real time data ingestion and aggregation of millions of events, and can build simple solutions to complex requirements.
* Experience with Docker / Kubernetes, and message buses like Kafka.
* You are calm during incidents when debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack.
* You are a life\\-long student with a self\\-motivated desire to build and share your knowledge and skill; you have the ability and desire to mentor as well as be mentored.

* Knowledge of system performance and operational readiness monitoring.
* Experience collaborating with remote teams across time zones.
* Experience working as a full\\-stack engineer will be an added advantage.

* Focus on mental health and well\\-being:
+ Company\\-paid therapy sessions through SpringHealth
+ Company\\-paid subscription to Headspace
