* Architect a client\\-side application that manages developer workflows and communicates securely with hosted services
* Solve complex ""Day 2"" operations challenges, such as designing interfaces to solve DevOps challenges to manage users, secrets, and updates
* Collaborate with security and product teams to ensure the platform can execute code generation and LLM\\-based tasks securely, protecting both client data and MongoDB IP
* Act as a hands\\-on leader, guiding the team through technical challenges related to container security, local vs. hosted logic distribution, and cross\\-service data sharing


 The ideal candidate for this role will have
   

  

* 8\\+ years of software development and operations experience, with a focus on building internal developer platforms (IDP) or distributable software infrastructure
* 2\\+ years of experience leading, coaching, and mentoring a team of engineers to achieve high\\-impact results

* Experience building Service Host architectures that provide shared routing, proxy layers, and API gateways for multiple underlying services
* Experience managing persistent storage solutions (blob/file storage) within distributed systems
* Understanding of security\\-first design, specifically regarding the execution of untrusted code, fine\\-grain access control, and rigorous input validation
* Experience designing auto\\-update mechanisms for software that cannot directly access the public internet
