* Upstream Inventory Management \\- Creating a single platform for merchants to manage their inventory and plan their supply chain in the self\\-serve portal with all the insights and recommendations from Flexport.


* Wholesale and Retail orders \\- Building the distribution capabilities to brick\\-and\\-mortar retailers and wholesalers. This includes onboarding, ingestion, digitalization, and outbounds of bulk orders.


* Warehouse Operational excellence \\- Improving the freight booking process and communication across operations, clients, carriers, and partners for inbound, outbound, and all related shipments from or to US warehouse facilities at Flexport.


**You will:**

* What’s freight forwarding and why does it matter? Freight forwarding is the coordination and shipment of goods from one place to another and it’s what makes global trade possible. Flexport is on a mission to make global trade easier for everyone because we believe it can help connect the world and break down economic barriers.
* We know this industry is complex. That’s why we invest in education starting day one with Flexport Academy, a one\\-week intensive onboarding program designed specifically to set every new Flexport employee up for success.
