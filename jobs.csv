 years
   

  

**Role Type:** 
 Full\\-Time, Onsite
   

  

**About Seventh Triangle**
 Seventh Triangle is a leading consumer tech and ecommerce consulting firm and a Shopify Plus Partner, working with some of India’s largest enterprise brands. With a 150\\+ member team across Noida and Bangalore, we specialise in technology development, UI/UX, marketing strategy, performance advertising, retention, and digital commerce transformation.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for a hands\\-on Frontend Developer who genuinely cares about UI quality, stability, and performance. This role is not for someone who wants a “React\\-only” job. We need someone who can work across React, Next.js, HTML/CSS/JS, and Shopify Liquid, and take complete ownership of their work.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Build production\\-ready, stable, and polished frontend experiences using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Identify even the smallest UI imperfections — flickers, layout shifts, slow rendering, inconsistent spacing — and fix them proactively.
* Work on site performance improvements: LCP, CLS, image optimization, caching strategies, lazy\\-loading, etc.
* Implement analytics \\& tracking using GTM, GA4, Meta Pixel, and similar tools.
* Own assigned modules completely — from understanding requirements → planning → execution → delivery — without constant supervision.
* Work across different tech stacks depending on the project: React apps, Next.js websites, Shopify Liquid themes \\& components.
* Troubleshoot UI bugs, browser inconsistencies, state flow issues, and frontend performance problems.


**Required Skills \\& Expectations**
**Core Technical Skills**
* Minimum 1 year of production experience building and releasing real websites.
* Strong base in HTML, CSS, JavaScript — candidates who only know React without fundamentals will not be considered.
* Proficient with React; experience with Next.js is a strong plus.
* Shopify Liquid experience is a major advantage (or willingness to learn quickly).
* Understanding of Core Web Vitals and practical experience improving LCP, CLS, and overall performance.
* Working knowledge of GTM, GA, and other analytics integrations.


**Quality \\+ Ownership**
* Extreme attention to detail — anything visually or interactively off must be unacceptable to you.
* Problem\\-solving mindset is non\\-negotiable — if you cannot debug issues logically, this is not the right role.
* Ability to take ownership of a project/module without hand\\-holding.
* Comfortable with any frontend task — small UI bug to enterprise\\-scale feature, React to Liquid, basic page to complex component.
* Must be open and motivated to grow into a complete frontend engineer, not restricted to a single framework.


**Good To Have**
* Knowledge of SEO\\-friendly frontend practices.
* Understanding of Web Accessibility basics.
* Familiarity with Git workflows and modern development tooling.
* Knowledge of state\\-management libraries such as Redux, MobX, or Zustand is a plus.
* Experience with AI\\-assisted coding tools (Copilot, Cursor, etc.).


**Format Requirements**
* Keep the entire submission under 300 words.
* Keep each answer 3–5 sentences.
* This writeup must be strictly written by you, not by AI tools.


**Important – Zero Tolerance Policy**
* We evaluate tone, structure, and writing patterns.
* If your note appears generic, templated, or AI\\-generated,
* your application will be rejected immediately without review.
* We also verify this during the interview.
* If your explanation does not match your written submission, the application is disqualified.


**Who Should Apply**
* Someone who wants to master the entire frontend ecosystem, not one library.
* Someone who focuses on quality, details, and smooth user experience.
* Someone who takes ownership, can deliver independently, and enjoys problem solving.


**Who Should NOT Apply**
* If you want a React\\-only role.
* If you are not detail\\-oriented.
* If you rely heavily on AI to write or debug everything.
* If you need constant reminders and follow\\-ups on tasks.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://in.linkedin.com/company/seventh-triangle-consulting","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQF4aKuBWVJJGw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1658490510864/seventh_triangle_consulting_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7yLfMMHgAXlN3aeofBnx3ZefesfKx-dUAFaILW92FwA","","","","","","","","","","",""
