**About The Role**
 We’re looking for an
 **early\\-career software engineer** 
 who loves to build, learn, and ship. This isn’t a role where you’ll just “write tickets.” You’ll join a small, empowered product team and contribute directly to real features that reach thousands of users.
   

  

 We care more about
 **what you’ve built** 
 than where you’ve worked. Personal projects, open\\-source contributions, or side apps matter as much as your degree. If you’re curious, self\\-motivated, and want to learn how great products are made — this is for you.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Build real features: Write production code in Angular and TypeScript that users actually touch.
* Learn the full stack: Get hands\\-on experience with AWS Lambda, Java/Node.js, and CI/CD pipelines.
* Collaborate cross\\-functionally: Work with product managers and designers to solve user problems, not just technical tasks.
* Experiment and iterate: Use feature flags (GrowthBook, LaunchDarkly, etc.) to safely ship and learn.
* Grow your craft: Participate in code reviews, pair programming, and mentorship sessions with senior engineers.
* Show initiative: Bring your ideas and projects to life — we value builders and problem\\-solvers.


**What You Bring**
* Bachelor’s degree (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field.
* Strong English communication — clear writing and willingness to ask good questions.
* Solid understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Exposure to Angular, React, or any modern front\\-end framework.
* Curiosity about AWS Lambda or serverless architectures.
* Demonstrated passion through personal projects, hackathons, open\\-source work, or side apps.
* Willingness to learn, experiment, and take ownership of your growth.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience deploying projects to AWS, Vercel, or Cloudflare.
* Familiarity with GitHub Actions or other CI/CD automation tools.
* Some backend exposure — Java (Spring Boot) or Node.js.
* Basic understanding of feature flags or A/B testing.
* Contributions to open\\-source projects or a portfolio on GitHub.


**How We Work**
 We believe in
 **empowered product teams** 
 — small, autonomous groups of engineers, designers, and PMs who own outcomes, not tasks.
   

  

 You’ll learn to think like a
 **product engineer** 
 — balancing technical quality, user needs, and business value.
   

  

 We’ll invest in your
 **growth, autonomy, and mastery** 
 — and expect you to bring energy, curiosity, and craftsmanship every day.
   

  

**You’re a Fit If You…**
* Love building things that people actually use.
* Learn fast and take initiative — you don’t wait to be told what to do.
* Care about writing clean, thoughtful code. See mistakes as part of progress.
* Want to grow into a product\\-minded engineer, not just a coder.
