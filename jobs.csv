Conventional QA approaches—even those incorporating rudimentary automation—consistently miss critical defects until it's too late, causing expensive delays and user dissatisfaction. Industry data reveals that more than 60% of software defects are detected after release, and quality issues cost the global software sector in excess of $2 trillion annually. The push for quicker, more dependable software demands a fundamental transformation in quality assurance strategy.
   

  

 IgniteTech is pioneering this transformation by embedding GenAI capabilities throughout the QA lifecycle. Through AI\\-powered simulation of user interactions, automated generation of sophisticated test scenarios, and intelligent analysis of defect patterns, we achieve accelerated releases with reduced bug counts. Becoming part of our team means positioning yourself at the cutting edge of innovation and leveraging AI to remove bottlenecks and anticipate issues before they materialize.
   

  

 This position differs significantly from conventional QA roles. If your expectation is a traditional setting focused on manual test case execution or maintaining repetitive automation scripts, this opportunity is not suitable for you. In this role, you will take ownership of building and advancing AI\\-powered test automation architectures, apply predictive analytics to surface latent risks, and contribute to defining the next generation of software quality practices. You will design scalable solutions that respond to the demands of contemporary development environments, rather than operating within a rigid, obsolete framework. If this aligns with the challenge you've been seeking, submit your application now to influence the future trajectory of software development.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Build and sustain AI\\-powered test automation frameworks that generate test cases, scripts, and datasets for thorough validation
* Leverage GenAI technologies to evaluate testing results, detect defect patterns, and deliver actionable recommendations for ongoing enhancement
* Create simulations of user interactions, load conditions, and boundary scenarios to detect potential problems before end\\-user impact


**Software Quality Assurance Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Apply AI and automation technologies to accelerate product delivery timelines and reduce product defect rates


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your default approach is to write code first and subsequently use AI tools to verify or enhance your code, rather than the other way around, then please do not apply)
* A minimum of 2 years of experience in a QA automation role
* Proficiency in Selenium and one of the following languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
* Professional experience using AI tools to automate QA workflows
* Familiarity with CI/CD platforms, such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions

* TimeBack: Educational platform driving Alpha School's 2\\-hour learning model (99th percentile test results).
* Incept: Content generation platform producing all personalized educational materials for multiple learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
* Crossover: AI\\-powered hiring platform handling tens of thousands of applicants monthly, staffing schools and companies worldwide.


 You will take ownership of one platform and dedicate the majority of your time to constructing the most complex components of the codebase with a compact team (3\\-5 experienced engineers, no junior members). The architectural choices you make will dictate whether other teams can quickly build new applications, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Correct decisions unlock massive leverage. Poor decisions generate integration failures and destroy velocity across multiple teams.
   

  

 You design, build, and operate your own work. You set quality standards and define patterns for your platform. Our approach is spec\\-driven: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. Expect high autonomy, no committees, no approval boards. You work within a small, focused team where accountability for what you deliver rests with you.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Formulate strategic architectural choices and define technical patterns for the team to adopt.
* AI Leadership: Champion the adoption of emerging AI workflows and produce high\\-impact playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the intricate, high\\-stakes components of the codebase working directly with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality standards.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Serving as an architect without hands\\-on implementation
* Spending time trapped in endless meetings
* Managing people (this role focuses on technical leadership, not personnel management)
* Handling legacy maintenance or internal IT systems


**Basic Requirements**
**Technical Lead key responsibilities**
* A minimum of 5 years of professional software development experience building software products
* A minimum of 3 years serving as either a lead engineer (conducting code reviews) or architect (driving key technical decisions)
* Experience developing platform\\-level products where your APIs were consumed by other teams
* Deep involvement with AI tools, consistently experimenting and exploring new capabilities
