Conventional QA methods—including those relying on rudimentary automation—struggle to identify critical defects early in the lifecycle, resulting in expensive setbacks and dissatisfied end users. Industry data reveals that more than 60% of software defects surface after release, and quality failures impose costs exceeding $2 trillion annually on the global software sector. Meeting the need for rapid, dependable software requires a fundamental shift in quality assurance strategy.
   

  

 IgniteTech is pioneering this transformation by embedding GenAI capabilities across all phases of the QA lifecycle. Leveraging AI to model user interactions, produce intricate test scenarios, and evaluate defect patterns allows us to ship releases more quickly with reduced bug counts. Becoming part of our team means standing at the cutting edge of technological advancement and applying AI to remove bottlenecks and anticipate issues before they materialize.
   

  

 This is not a conventional QA role. If you are seeking an environment centered on manual test runs or repetitive scripted automation, this position will not suit you. In this role, you will drive the design and continuous improvement of AI\\-powered test automation platforms, apply predictive analytics to surface latent risks, and contribute to redefining software quality standards. You will serve as the engineer behind adaptive, scalable solutions tailored to the demands of contemporary development—not a participant in an inflexible, legacy workflow. If this represents the challenge you have been seeking, submit your application now and influence the trajectory of software engineering.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Design and sustain AI\\-powered test automation frameworks that generate test cases, automation scripts, and datasets for end\\-to\\-end validation
* Leverage GenAI platforms to evaluate test results, detect defect patterns, and deliver actionable recommendations for ongoing enhancement
* Model user interactions, load scenarios, and boundary conditions to detect potential failures before they affect end users


**Quality Assurance Automation Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Employ AI and automation technologies to accelerate product delivery cycles and reduce defect rates


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your default approach is to write code manually before turning to AI tools for validation or refinement, rather than leading with AI, please do not apply)
* A minimum of 2 years of professional experience in QA automation
* Demonstrated proficiency with Selenium and at least one of the following: Python, Java, JavaScript
* Hands\\-on professional experience applying AI tools to automate quality assurance processes
* Working knowledge of CI/CD systems, including Jenkins or GitHub Actions

* TimeBack: An educational platform that drives Alpha School's 2\\-hour learning approach (99th percentile test outcomes).
* Incept: A content generation platform producing all customized educational materials for several learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
* Crossover: An AI\\-driven hiring platform that handles tens of thousands of candidates monthly, supporting staffing for schools and organizations worldwide.


 You will take ownership of one of these platforms and dedicate the majority of your time to constructing the most intricate components of the codebase with a compact team (3\\-5 experienced engineers, no junior members). The architectural choices you make will dictate whether other teams can swiftly develop new applications, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Execute well and you unlock significant leverage. Poor decisions result in integration challenges and erode velocity across numerous teams.
   

  

 You design, build, and operate your own work. You set quality standards and establish patterns for your platform. Our approach is spec\\-driven: design precedes implementation, planning always comes before building. You operate with high autonomy—no committees, no review boards. You work within a small, cohesive team and remain accountable for everything you deliver.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Define strategic architectural choices and set technical patterns that guide the team.
* AI Leadership: Champion the integration of emerging AI workflows and develop impactful playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the complex, mission\\-critical components of the codebase in collaboration with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify that your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality benchmarks.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Acting as an architect who never writes code
* Spending time in unproductive meetings
* Managing personnel (this is a technical leadership position, not a people management role)
* Supporting legacy systems or internal IT infrastructure


**Basic Requirements**
**Staff Software Engineer key responsibilities**
* A minimum of 5 years of professional software development experience creating software products
* A minimum of 3 years serving as either a lead engineer (conducting code reviews) or architect (driving key technical decisions)
* Experience developing platform\\-level products where your APIs were consumed by other teams
* Strong involvement with AI tools, continuously experimenting and exploring new capabilities

Companies continue to staff large teams and depend on aging tools to manually produce content, manage discussions, and mine insights from fragmented interactions. Even with AI's dramatic rise, implementing a simple automation typically requires weeks, and results often stall at the pilot stage. The consequences include lost opportunities, exhausted personnel, and technology infrastructures unable to match the pace of contemporary business.
   

  

 IgniteTech is dismantling that framework. We substitute manual workflows with AI\\-native, self\\-optimizing systems operating at 10x the scale and velocity. Picture a marketing operation that generates and publishes content in response to live trends, or a community infrastructure that synthesizes, moderates, and channels insights within seconds—all built, launched, and refined by a compact team of AI\\-fluent developers working in 24\\-hour cycles. We don't stop at prototypes; we deliver production tools that immediately redefine operational execution.
   

  

 This position is not designed for candidates seeking to refine Jira workflows within a DevOps treadmill. You will not receive detailed specifications for implementation. You will instead control the complete lifecycle of intelligent systems that automate and advance our client operations. Your mandate includes identifying friction points, designing AI\\-centric solutions, launching MVPs in under a day, and evolving them into robust production engines with measurable impact. If your goal is a GenAI experimentation sandbox, look elsewhere. If you intend to deploy GenAI as a precision instrument, this is your opportunity.
   

  

 You will join a compact, high\\-caliber team reconstructing the operational blueprint of entire business domains with AI as the foundation. You will engage directly with stakeholders, operate with velocity, and evaluate your contributions through tangible business outcomes. If this environment aligns with your ambitions, submit your application now!
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Develop and deploy working AI prototypes within 24 hours that immediately automate authentic business processes
* Control AI systems from inception through deployment and monitoring, operating autonomously without dependencies or delays
* Advance automation continuously throughout the organization by surfacing new use cases and refining existing solutions to match shifting requirements and emerging capabilities


**Technical Lead Key Responsibilities**
* Construct a fully reimagined, AI\\-driven ecosystem that converts manual marketing workflows and community platforms into intelligent systems generating 10x business value


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your default approach is to write code first and then leverage AI tools for verification or enhancement, rather than the reverse, please do not apply)
* A minimum of 5 years of full\\-stack software engineering experience (both front\\-end and back\\-end development expertise required)
* Professional experience embedding AI/LLMs (through APIs, prompt engineering, or automation) into production applications
* Proficiency with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and constructing scalable, distributed architectures
* Understanding of when and why to select particular LLM models for varying tasks
* Proven knowledge and past implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
