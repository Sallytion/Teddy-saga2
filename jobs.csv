 Cloud Solution Architect
   

  

**Position Type:** 
 Regular \\- Full\\-Time
   

  

**Position Location:** 
 Gurgaon
   

  

**Requisition ID:** 
 33205
   

  

**Job Purpose**
 As a Cloud Solution Architect, you'll drive the success of our IT Architecture program through your design expertise and consultative approach. You'll collaborate with stakeholders to understand their technical requirements, designing and documenting tailored solutions. Your blend of architecture and operations experience will enable you to accurately size work efforts and determine the necessary skills and resources for projects. Strong communication, time management, and process skills are essential for success in this role. You should have deep experience in defining Infrastructure solutions: Design, Architecture and Solution Building blocks.
   

  

**Role Overview**
**Cloud Infrastructure Architect Job Description**
 The cloud infrastructure architect role helps teams (such as product teams, platform teams and application teams) successfully adopt cloud infrastructure and platform services. It is heavily involved in design and implementation activities that result in new or improved cloud\\-related capabilities, and it brings skills and expertise to such areas as cloud technical architecture (for a workload’s use of infrastructure as a service \\[IaaS] and platform as a service \\[PaaS] components); automating cloud management tasks, provisioning and configuration management; and other aspects involved in preparing and optimizing cloud solutions.
   

  

 Successful outcomes are likely to embrace infrastructure\\-as\\-code (IaC), DevOps and Agile ways of working and associated automation approaches, all underpinned by the cloud infrastructure engineer’s solid understanding of networking and security in the cloud. The nature of the work involved means that the cloud infrastructure engineer will directly engage with customer teams, but will also work on cloud infrastructure platform capabilities that span multiple teams.
   

  

 The cloud infrastructure architect collaborates closely with other architects, product/platform teams, software developers, Cloud Engineers, site reliability engineers (SREs), security, and network specialists, as well as other roles, particularly those in the infrastructure and operations. Being an approachable team\\-player is therefore crucial for success, and willingness to lead initiatives is important too.
   

  

 The cloud infrastructure engineer also supports colleagues with complex (escalated) operational concerns in areas such as deployment activities, event management, incident and problem management, availability, capacity and service\\-level management, as well as service continuity.
   

  

 The cloud infrastructure architect is expected to demonstrate strong attention to detail and a customer\\-centric mindset. Inquisitiveness, determination, creativity, communicative and collaboration skills are important qualities too.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Provide expert knowledge on cloud infrastructure and platforms solutions architecture, to ensure our organization achieves its goals for cloud adoption. This involves translating cloud strategy and architecture into efficient, resilient, and secure technical implementations.
* Define cloud infrastructure landing zones, regional subscriptions, Availability Zone, to ensure HA, resiliency and reliability of Infrastructure and applciations
* Offer cloud\\-engineering thought leadership in areas to define specific cloud use cases, cloud service providers, and/or strategic tools and technologies
* Support cloud strategy working on new cloud solutions including analysing requirements, supporting technical architecture activities, prototyping, design and development of infrastructure artifacts, testing, implementation, and the preparation for ongoing support.
* Work on cloud migration projects, including analyzing requirements and backlogs, identifying migration techniques, developing migration artifacts, executing processes, and ensuring preparations for ongoing support.
* Design, build, deliver, maintain and improve infrastructure solutions. This includes automation strategies such as IaC, configuration\\-as\\-code, policy\\-as\\-code, release orchestration and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and collaborative ways of working (e.g., DevOps). Participate in change and release management processes, carrying out complex provisioning and configuration tasks manually, where needed.
* Research and prototype new tools and technologies to enhance cloud platform capabilities. Proactively identify innovative ways to reduce toil, and teach, coach or mentor others to improve cloud outcomes using automation.
* Improve reliability, scalability and efficiency by working with product engineers and site reliability engineers to ensure well\\-architected and thoughtfully operationalized cloud infrastructures. This includes assisting with nonfunctional requirements, such as data protection, high availability, disaster recovery, monitoring requirements and efficiency considerations in different environments.
* Provide subject matter expertise for all approved IaaS and PaaS services, respond promptly to escalated incidents and requests, and build reusable artifacts ready for deployment to cloud environments.
* Exert influence that lifts cloud engineering competency by participating in (and, where applicable, leading) organizational learning practices, such as communities of practice, dojos, hackathons and centers of excellence (COEs). Actively participate in mentoring. Practice continuous improvement and knowledge sharing (e.g., providing KB articles, training and white papers).
* Participate in planning and optimization activities, including capacity, reliability, cost management and performance engineering.
* Establish FinOps Practices — Cloud Cost management, Scale up/down, Environment creation/deletion based on consumption
* Work closely with security specialists to design, implement and test security controls, and ensure engineering activities align to security configuration guidance.
