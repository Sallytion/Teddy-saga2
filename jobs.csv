 Changing the world through digital experiences is what Adobe’s all about. We give everyone—from emerging artists to global brands—everything they need to design and deliver exceptional digital experiences! We’re passionate about empowering people to create beautiful and powerful images, videos, and apps, and transform how companies interact with customers across every screen.
   

  

 We’re on a mission to hire the very best and are committed to creating exceptional employee experiences where everyone is respected and has access to equal opportunity. We realize that new ideas can come from everywhere in the organization, and we know the next big idea could be yours!
   

  

**The Opportunity:**
**Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO), one of the fastest\\-growing DX businesses, is looking for an exceptional Software Development Engineer to join their Journeys Orchestration team! We, in the AJO team, develop the platform that helps companies deliver connected, contextual, and personalized experiences to their end\\-customers. A customer journey is the entire process of a customer’s interactions with the brand, from the first moment of contact until the customer leaves. It starts with the awareness phase, where the customer learns about the brand and starts engaging. The customer will then interact further, visit online and physical sites, and make purchases, send messages, or post reviews. AJO is built natively on the Adobe Experience Platform and combines a unified, real\\-time customer profile, an API\\-first open framework, centralized offer decisioning, and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for personalization and optimization. Journey Optimizer allows brands to thoughtfully resolve the next best interaction with scale, speed, and flexibility across the entire customer journey. With AJO, companies can build and deliver both scheduled marketing campaigns (such as weekly promotions for a retail store) and tailored individual communications (like a push notification for an item that a loyalty app customer may have looked at that was previously out of stock) within the same application. They can lead scheduled omnichannel campaigns and one\\-to\\-one moments for millions of their customers from a single application. Our Journey Orchestration team is at the heart of it all.**
