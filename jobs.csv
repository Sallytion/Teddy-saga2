 Over the next two years, we will complete the UK’s largest and most successful digital infrastructure project – connecting more than 25 million premises to full fibre broadband. Together with our heavy investment in 5G, we play a central role in revolutionising how people connect with each other.
   

  

 While we are through the most capital\\-intensive phase of our fibre investment, meaning we can reward our shareholders for their commitment and patience, we are absolutely focused on how we organise ourselves in the best way to serve our customers in the years to come. This includes radical simplification of systems, structures, and processes on a huge scale. Together with our application of AI and technology, we are on a path to creating the UK’s best telco, reimagining the customer experience and relationship with one of this country’s biggest infrastructure companies.
   

  

 Change on the scale we will all experience in the coming years is unprecedented. BT Group is committed to being the driving force behind improving connectivity for millions and there has never been a more exciting time to join a company and leadership team with the skills, experience, creativity, and passion to take this company into a new era.
   

  

**A FEW POINTS TO NOTE:**
 Although these roles are listed as full\\-time, if you’re a job share partnership, work reduced hours, or any other way of working flexibly, please still get in touch.
   

  

 We will also offer reasonable adjustments for the selection process if required, so please do not hesitate to inform us.
   

  

**DON'T MEET EVERY SINGLE REQUIREMENT?**
 Studies have shown that women and people who are disabled, LGBTQ\\+, neurodiverse or from ethnic minority backgrounds are less likely to apply for jobs unless they meet every single qualification and criteria. We're committed to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace where everyone can be their best, so if you're excited about this role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every requirement on the Job Description, please apply anyway \\- you may just be the right candidate for this or other roles in our wider team.","Telecommunications","https://uk.linkedin.com/company/bt","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFcyvjY35EvXA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1663653523168/bt_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=2SiGiMMGU1oX_gBczkKNoQGGDFeaE3zQtY0neeeOsIs","","","","","","","","","","",""
