* Experience with RESTful APIs, backend service design, and microservice architectures.
* Experience with Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation or integration for managing agent context and state.
* Familiarity with modern cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Azure), especially in deploying containerized applications.
* Ability to write clean, testable code and follow best practices in code reviews and version control.
* Clear communicator, with a willingness to ask questions, propose ideas, and collaborate across teams.
* Passion for learning emerging AI techniques and contributing to real\\-world agentic applications.


**What you will bring:**
* BS degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, or related technical field.
