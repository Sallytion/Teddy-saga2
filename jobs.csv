 Whatfix is an AI platform advancing the “userization” of enterprise applications, empowering companies to maximize the ROI of their digital investments. Technology needs adoption. It’s no different for AI. As AI reshapes roles, workflows, and human\\-machine interactions, it also introduces new layers of complexity and user friction. This is where Whatfix plays a pivotal role. A decade old DNA of empowering people to succeed with technology and not replacing them. We call this philosophy
 **Userization** 
 : the belief that technology must adapt to the user, not the other way around.
 



  





 At the heart of userization philosophy is
 **ScreenSense** 
 , our proprietary AI engine, which continuously interprets both the context of what users are doing in an application or an AI tool and the intent behind their actions. By combining these signals, Whatfix delivers real\\-time guidance, nudges, knowledge, and automation directly in the flow of work.
 



  





 This intelligence powers our entire product suite.
 


* **Digital Adoption** 
 helps users get productive faster.
* **Product Analytics**

* **Whatfix Mirror 2\\.0** 
 is the world’s only System plus Role simulation with a complete assessment to lead the Gen AI simulation category.



  





 Together, these products reflect Whatfix’s commitment to building enterprise\\-ready AI teammates that maximize productivity and ROI. It gives users a unified, intelligent way to find answers across systems, apps, and knowledge silos and helps anyone looking to deliver fast and contextual answers.
 



  





 Whatfix is bridging the gap between rapid technological change and human enablement—ensuring AI is not only embedded but also usable, trusted, and outcome\\-driven for every employee.
 



  





 At Whatfix, we’re not just making software easier—we’re making AI work for people.
 



  





 The company has seven offices across the US, India, UK, Germany, Singapore, and Australia and a presence across 40\\+ countries.

 Whatfix is an AI platform advancing the “userization” of enterprise applications, empowering companies to maximize the ROI of their digital investments. Technology needs adoption.

 Whatfix is an AI platform advancing the “userization” of enterprise applications, empowering companies to maximize the ROI of their digital investments. Technology needs adoption.
