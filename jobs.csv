 The Platform Engineering team is building a secure, scalable control plane that powers critical product workflows across the company. As a Senior Engineer, you’ll help take foundational capabilities from 0 → 1 → 10—hardening security, improving operational resilience, and making complex configuration systems dramatically easier to run and extend.
 



  





 You’ll work on high\\-impact distributed systems and platform primitives—from designing robust authorization for sensitive operations, to building safer change workflows (think dual\\-control / two\\-person review for high\\-risk writes), to scaling the platform for growing workloads and new product use cases.
 



  





 At the same time, you’ll drive adoption by enabling multiple product teams to use the platform as a default, reusable capability, and you’ll level up the admin experience with thoughtful improvements especially for complex, hierarchical configurations so operators can move fast without compromising correctness or security.
 



  





**What you will do** 



* Own the architectural integrity of core services, ensuring they remain performant and resilient as Rippling’s product suite expands.
* Design and implement strong authorization controls for sensitive platform operations
* Build guardrails for safe changes, including dual\\-approval workflows for critical writes
* Scale and “productionize” the platform for higher throughput and more diverse use cases
* Improve operability (monitoring, reliability patterns, runbooks, tooling) to meet OpEx standards
* Work in a cross functional, multi geographic environment and deliver and support complex products and services.
* Act as a technical pillar for the team by conducting rigorous code reviews, mentoring mid\\-level and junior engineers, and establishing best practices that improve developer velocity across the entire organization.
* Influence the technical direction and tooling strategy across Rippling.



  





**What you will need** 



* Strong technical depth — quality and scope of experience matter more than years, though successful candidates typically have 7\\+ years of hands\\-on development experience.
* A track record of optimizing performance in backend, data\\-intensive systems.
* Ability to operate and scale systems in high\\-growth, high\\-complexity environments.
* Comfort with ambiguity — you identify high\\-leverage problems and take ownership without waiting for perfect clarity.
* Strong technical leadership and influence across org boundaries — not just as an implementer, but as a driver of sound, scalable technology choices.
* Clear, concise communication — you can distill complex ideas into actionable insights for engineers, PMs, and stakeholders alike.
