* **14\\+ years** 
 of experience building large\\-scale, distributed systems in
 **high\\-compliance or high\\-integrity domains** 
 (HR, Payroll, FinTech, or Insurance).
* Deep expertise in

 .
* Strong understanding of
 **policy enforcement, rule engines, and event\\-driven systems** 
 .
* Ability to translate
 **legal and operational complexity** 
 into
 **elegant, maintainable engineering abstractions** 
 .
* A
 **hands\\-on architectural leader** 
 who can set technical direction, mentor teams, and drive large\\-scale transformations sustainably.



  





**Bonus Points**



* Experience with
 **compliance\\-as\\-code** 
 or
 **policy automation** 
 frameworks.
* Exposure to
 **global employment** 
 ,

Conventional quality assurance methods, including rudimentary automation, consistently miss critical defects until it's too late, resulting in expensive setbacks and dissatisfied end users. Industry data shows that more than 60% of software defects surface after release, and quality\\-related failures impose costs exceeding $2 trillion annually on the global software industry. The need for accelerated, dependable software delivery requires a fundamental transformation in quality assurance methodology.
   

  

 IgniteTech is driving this transformation by embedding GenAI capabilities throughout the entire QA lifecycle. Leveraging AI to replicate user interactions, create sophisticated test scenarios, and evaluate defect patterns enables us to achieve quicker deployments with reduced bug counts. Becoming part of our team positions you at the cutting edge of innovation, applying AI to remove bottlenecks and anticipate failures before they materialize.
   

  

 This position differs fundamentally from conventional QA roles. If your interest lies in a traditional setting focused on manual test runs or repetitive scripted automation, this opportunity is not suitable. In this role, you will take ownership of designing and advancing AI\\-powered test automation architectures, implement predictive analytics to surface latent risks, and contribute to redefining software quality standards. You will serve as the designer of adaptive, scalable solutions aligned with the demands of contemporary development—not as a participant in an inflexible, legacy workflow. If this aligns with the challenge you've been seeking, submit your application to influence the evolution of software development.

* Minimum of 2 years of professional experience in QA automation
* Demonstrated proficiency with Selenium and at least one of these programming languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
* Hands\\-on professional experience applying AI tools to automate quality assurance processes
