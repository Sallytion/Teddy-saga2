**Role Overview:** 




 We are seeking an AI Prompt \\& Policy Specialist to help design, evaluate, and improve how AI systems interact with tools, APIs, and users across multiple locales. In this role, you will work at the intersection of prompt engineering, policy design, and safety, ensuring that AI\\-driven workflows are accurate, compliant, and user\\-friendly.
 



 You will use your API/JSON literacy, SQL basics, policy creation skills, and strong critical reasoning to review, refine, and design prompts and behaviors for AI systems interacting with products like Slack, PayPal, and other third\\-party tools. This role also requires strong communication skills and awareness of safety and content filtering, especially across a wide range of languages and locales.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day life look like?** 



* Design, review, and refine prompts and instructions for AI systems interacting with tools, APIs, and external services.
* Read and understand API/JSON schemas and arguments to ensure correct parameter usage and tool behavior.
* Apply SQL basics to validate data, perform simple checks, and support analysis of AI or tool behavior.
* Create, document, and maintain policies and guidelines governing AI interactions, content handling, and tool workflows.
* Develop workflow knowledge for specific tools (e.g., Slack, PayPal and similar platforms) and encode that into prompts and policies.
* Ensure safety and compliance by applying content filtering guidelines and detecting unsafe or non\\-compliant outputs.
* Evaluate AI responses for critical reasoning quality, correctness of parameters, and adherence to policies.
* Support multilingual use cases by validating prompts and responses across multiple locales, with attention to nuance and clarity.
* Collaborate with product, engineering, and safety teams to iterate on prompts, policies, and workflows based on evaluation findings.
* Document edge cases, decision rationales, and recommendations with clear, concise written communication.



  





**Requirements:** 



* **3–6 years of experience in any combination of:** 
 AI operations, content review, QA, product operations, policy, or technical support roles.
* **Strong API / JSON literacy:** 
 ability to read schemas, understand arguments, and verify correct parameter usage.
* **SQL basics:** 
 ability to run simple queries to validate data, investigate issues, or support analysis.
* Demonstrated experience with prompt engineering or writing clear, structured instructions for AI or automation systems.
* **Proven policy creation skills:** 
 drafting, interpreting, and applying guidelines or policies in an operational setting.
* Familiarity with tool\\-specific workflows (e.g., Slack, PayPal, or similar SaaS platforms), including typical user actions and edge cases.
* Strong communication skills, with the ability to write clear, concise rationales and explanations; comfort working with multilingual contexts across many locales.
* High safety awareness for content filtering, including sensitivity to harmful, abusive, or policy\\-violating content.
* Excellent critical reasoning and judgment, especially when evaluating ambiguous or complex cases.
* Strong attention to detail, particularly in checking parameters, arguments, and compliance with specified schemas or policies.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing:** 



* Work in a fully remote environment.
* Opportunity to work on cutting\\-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.



  





**Offer Details:** 



* **Commitments Required:** 
 At least 4 hours per day and minimum 20 hours per week with overlap of 4 hours with PST.
* **Engagement Type:** 
 Contractor assignment (no medical/paid leave)
* **Duration of Contract:** 
 3 months (adjustable based on engagement)
