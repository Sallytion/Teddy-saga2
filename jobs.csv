 We’re building an agentic AI database platform where intelligent automation meets intuitive design. Join our small, execution\\-focused development team powered by deep database expertise as we redefine how teams monitor and optimize database performance.
   

  

**About Mydbops**
 Mydbops helps fast\\-growing teams and unicorns run mission\\-critical databases with speed, scale, and reliability. Trusted by 800\\+ clients, including 30\\+ unicorns, we optimize and manage systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, TiDB, and Cassandra, powering 10B\\+ transactions daily across industries such as fintech, SaaS, healthcare, logistics, and e\\-commerce.
   

  

 With 9\\+ years of deep expertise, we build automation tools, lead complex migrations, and solve high\\-impact performance and database challenges. We are ISO and PCI\\-DSS certified, combining engineering excellence with enterprise\\-grade security and compliance.
   

  

**Role**
 You'll architect and build our frontend from the ground up, crafting a modern, production\\-ready agentic AI application that makes complex database insights clear, accessible, and actionable. In this high\\-impact role, your technical decisions will shape how our platform scales and evolves.
   

  

**What You'll Own**
* Design and implement the entire frontend architecture using modern technologies
* Build responsive, performant UIs that handle real\\-time data and complex user workflows
* Collaborate closely with backend and AI teams to define system boundaries, advocate for optimal data flows, and craft experiences that make AI accessible
* Establish engineering standards for testing, CI/CD, and code quality
* Balance technical excellence with product intuition and a deep focus on user experience


**Core Requirements**
**What We're Looking For**
* 3 to 5 Years building production frontends with proven performance, security, and architectural ownership
* Strong proficiency in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern component\\-based architecture
* Deep knowledge of authentication, RBAC, session management, and frontend security best practices.

 We value execution over meetings, ownership over hand\\-holding, and long\\-term thinking over quick fixes. We're looking for someone who:
   

  

* Takes initiative and drives projects to completion independently
* Writes clean, maintainable code with testing in mind
* Cares equally about performance, security, and user experience
* Balances technical debt with product velocity and user impact


**This Role Likely Isn't a Fit If**
* You need daily task breakdowns to make progress
* You haven't built and shipped production\\-grade applications end\\-to\\-end
* You avoid dealing with performance, authentication, or architecture
* You prefer polishing UI components over solving deep product problems
