 Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.
   

  

 Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third\\-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.
   

  

 Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1\\.85B\\+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.
   

  

 We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.
   

  

 At Rippling, the Accounting Integrations team sits at the critical intersection of product innovation and financial infrastructure. Our mission is to
 ****empower finance teams to move from traditional month\\-end closes to real\\-time accounting****
 by seamlessly connecting Rippling’s platform with the world’s most widely\\-used ERP systems, including
 ****NetSuite****
 ,
 ****QuickBooks****
 , and soon
 ****Microsoft Dynamics 365****
 ,
 ****Oracle****
 , and more.
   

  

 We build robust, bi\\-directional integrations that serve both Rippling’s internal products (like Payroll, Spend Management, Procurement, and Travel) and external ERPs used by our customers. These integrations power complex accounting workflows such as journal syncing, reconciliation, audit readiness, and more, enabling our customers to automate the most repetitive and error\\-prone financial operations.
   

  

 As Rippling expands globally and moves upmarket to serve large enterprises, the Accounting Integrations team is at the forefront of unlocking key use cases and supporting new geographies, integrations, and accounting standards. This team also operates in a high\\-velocity, continuous delivery environment, tackling a wide surface area of capabilities, systems, and support scenarios.
   

  

 If you’re excited by systems design, love working across product boundaries, and want to build foundational infrastructure that finance teams depend on, the Accounting Integrations team is the place to be.
   

  

 What you will do
   

  

* Design and develop scalable systems that automate the flow of financial data between Rippling products (e.g. Payroll, Spend, Travel) and external ERPs like NetSuite, QuickBooks, and Xero.
* Own and ship medium\\-to\\-large features with minimal guidance.
* Break down complex, ambiguous problems into actionable technical plans and execute them in collaboration with product and engineering partners
* Build fault\\-tolerant, configuration\\-driven frameworks that support growing enterprise and international use cases across multiple ERPs.
* Write clean, well\\-tested code with comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure accuracy, auditability, and performance.

**Who You Are**
* You care about product ownership and solving problems for our customers.


 You’re passionate about being in a product\\-focused environment where everyone cares deeply about customer impact.
   

  

* Adapt and learn beyond your core expertise: pick up new frameworks, front\\-end or back\\-end technologies, infrastructure tools, and domain concepts to get work done autonomously.
* Embrace a sense of urgency to onboard quickly: shadow support rotations, tackle real tickets early, and proactively identify opportunities to streamline processes, documentation, and tooling.


 What you will need
   

  

* 3\\+ years of professional software development experience, ideally in backend or integration\\-heavy environments.
* Proficiency in Python, Go, or similar backend languages; experience with Postgres, Kafka, or gRPC is a plus.

* Proven troubleshooting and support skills, with experience debugging production incidents, analyzing logs/metrics, and driving root\\-cause fixes.
* Product mindset and communication excellence, able to collaborate with PMs, UX, internal teams, and external partners to turn ambiguous requirements into robust solutions.
* Self\\-starter attitude, comfortable learning new frameworks, digging into unfamiliar codebases, and proactively taking on non\\-core tasks (e.g., light front\\-end work, custom tooling, support).
* Bonus: Prior hands\\-on with ERP\\-specific APIs or SDKs (NetSuite SuiteTalk, QuickBooks API, Dynamics OData, Oracle integrations).
* Bonus: Direct experience or deep interest in accounting workflows (journal entries, reconciliations, book closure).
