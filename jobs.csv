 The Dabba Network is a
 **De** 
 centralised
 **P** 
 hysical
 **I** 
 nfrastructure
 **N** 
 etwork that is building high speed wireless networks from the ground up in India. We enable humans \\& machines with internet connectivity at a price that they can afford.
   

  

 Internet and WiFi are critical to every human. Dabba is building the software, hardware \\& operating solutions to make internet access ubiquitous \\& affordable. We believe every household should come with internet, networking, and WiFi; just like water, gas, and electricity, the internet is a fundamental utility.
   

  

 Unlike traditional internet solutions, Dabba's approach is vertically\\-integrated across engineering and operations. We design and manufacture our own hardware, develop the entire software stack, and manage our users’ network.
   

  

 We are looking for people who are excited to work on complex problems, enjoy learning and working with others, and above all, are resilient and empathic. Join \\& help us build something amazing together for the next billion users.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As a member of embedded platform team your goal is to:
   

  

* Build the hardware systems that create the physical foundation of Dabba.
* Build the operating systems that run on that hardware.
* Write the WiFi and networking firmware and drivers.
* Monitor how our hardware behaves and performs for continuous improvements.


 Fundamentally, you will provide the state\\-of\\-the\\-art foundation on which the rest of Dabba's product is built. We leverage existing Open Source Software whenever possible. Our users are both internal and external; in addition to our customers, we must consider the engineers who build on top of our platforms and the Operations Team that installs, monitors, and uses our devices.
   

  

 On any given project, you might debug new hardware, adjust the C\\-based firmware, write a new Linux driver, create a test framework, prototype APIs for Backend Engineers, and then wrap it up in a well\\-designed build system.
   

  

 Technology Stack
   

  

 We use Linux, OpenWRT, Buildroot, C, Python, make and Bash. We work on a variety of architectures, including: ARM, ath79 and x86\\-64\\. Currently, we work with QCA WiFi chips. Prospective team members must be flexible and able to learn new technologies, chips, and architectures.
   

  

 Other software team at Dabba use technologies like MERN, Postgres, and AWS. Having a knowledge of these and/or similar technologies, while not mandatory, will make it easier to work with other teams and provide the platforms they need.
   

  

 You might be a good fit if
   

  

* You believe in continual improvement of a product with a strong history of releases.
* You can intelligently debate the pros and cons of using OpenWRT vs. Yocto/OE because you have developed products using one or more of them.
* You have successfully upstreamed a patch to the Linux kernel, OpenWRT, Buildroot, or any other major project.
* You understand HostAPD, Portal, RADIUS, AAA, Identity and role management, Radsec
* Tunnels, Firewall, Iptables, Flow Classification, QoS, TLS, DTLS are your companions
* You have used a schematic, a datasheet, and a header file to determine and fix an error.
* You enjoy converting decimal to hex to binary.
* When you encounter a long list of magic incantations to build an image, you redesign the build system so all you have to do is type make.
* You have implemented a network protocol from the RFC or official specification.
* You add test cases to frameworks because of a known bug.
* You improve documentation instead of simply complaining that it is bad.
* You are thoughtful and measured in your approach to solving problems.
* You like to make LEDs blink. And you know both how and why they do.


 If you are interested in joining us
   

  

 We encourage you to reach out even if your experience doesn't precisely match this job description. We operate with a growth mindset and expect ourselves and our colleagues to have the capacity and desire for ongoing growth.
   

  

* Tell us a little bit about yourself, why you are interested in what we are doing, and any relevant experience you have.
* Attach your resume.
* Please include links to LinkedIn, Github, any code samples, or blog posts.
