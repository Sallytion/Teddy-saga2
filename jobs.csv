 PayPal has been revolutionizing commerce globally for more than 25 years. Creating innovative experiences that make moving money, selling, and shopping simple, personalized, and secure, PayPal empowers consumers and businesses in approximately 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy.
   

  

 We operate a global, two\\-sided network at scale that connects hundreds of millions of merchants and consumers. We help merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third\\-party payment networks. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our platform on behalf of our customers.
   

  

 We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end\\-to\\-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross\\-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross\\-border trade.
   

  

 Our beliefs are the foundation for how we conduct business every day. We live each day guided by our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness. Together, our values ensure that we work together as one global team with our customers at the center of everything we do – and they push us to ensure we take care of ourselves, each other, and our communities.
   

  

**Job Description Summary:**

We handle billions of these decisions a day. The platform is going through a major modernization effort, and this team is at the center of it. The team owns a custom domain\\-specific language (RDSL), the Studio UI where rules are authored and tested, the runtime engine that executes them in production, a Kubernetes fleet of 250\\+ use cases, and a new set of AI agents that convert natural\\-language rule descriptions into valid RDSL and feed them into the release pipeline. This is a full\\-stack platform role, not a narrow feature team.

**K8s Fleet:** 
 Hands\\-on with provisioning, monitoring, and troubleshooting deployments. Improve existing tooling.

We’re growing, profitable and nowhere near done.
 



  





**What we do is important** 




 In an increasingly digital world, there is a desperate need to augment our human experience by getting us to interact with the real world around us and the people in it.

**Role Overview** 
 UniLiv is building tech\\-enabled premium living at scale. We're looking for a Senior Product Manager (Applications) who has hands\\-on experience building software before transitioning into product — someone who brings real engineering depth to product thinking. You will lead the end\\-to\\-end creation of in\\-house applications (both frontend and backend) from scratch, manage and mentor a team of developers and technical specialists, and own improvements across our resident\\-facing app and internal operations tools. This role sits at the intersection of technology leadership and product execution — ideal for someone who has coded, understands architecture, and can now drive a team to ship great products.
 



  





**What You'll Own** 



* **In\\-house application development:** 
 Lead the design, architecture, and ground\\-up development of frontend and backend applications — from ideation through deployment
* Resident experience workflows (support/complaints, service requests, communications, payments, community/event flows, add\\-on service journeys)
* Ops productivity workflows (ticket assignment, SLA tracking, escalations, audits/checklists, maintenance/housekeeping workflows, closure validation)
* Data \\& reporting reliability (clean status/taxonomy design, instrumentation, dashboards that leadership and ops teams can trust)
* Engineering team leadership: Own sprint planning, code quality standards, technical decision\\-making, and delivery timelines



  





**Key Responsibilities** 



* **Lead in\\-house app building from scratch:** 
 Define tech stack, system architecture, and development roadmap for new frontend and backend applications; work hands\\-on with your team to bring them to life
* **Lead and manage the tech team:** 
 Hire, mentor, and manage a team of frontend developers, backend developers, and other technical contributors — set direction, unblock them, and hold the bar on quality
* Problem discovery \\& prioritization: Spend time with CX/Ops teams and on\\-ground staff to identify bottlenecks, define problem statements, and prioritize high\\-impact work
* Strong product specs: Write PRDs and user stories that engineering can build without ambiguity — flows, edge cases, non\\-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and test scenarios
* Execution \\& release ownership: Run sprint rhythm (backlog grooming, sprint planning, UAT coordination), manage releases, ensure quality, and own post\\-release iteration
* Workflow/system design: Build scalable operational logic (ticket lifecycle, ownership rules, escalation ladder, reopen logic, closure validation, SOP alignment)
* Metrics \\& adoption: Define KPIs (TAT, reopen %, SLA breaches, adoption) and drive measurable improvements through pilots → iteration → scale



  





**Must\\-Have** 



* **Prior background as a software developer or engineer (frontend and/or backend)** 
 — you have built and shipped full\\-stack or multi\\-tier applications before moving into product (this is non\\-negotiable)
* Proven experience leading a team of developers and technical contributors — you know how to set direction, review architecture, and drive accountability
* Strong understanding of frontend (React, Flutter, or equivalent) and backend (APIs, databases, server\\-side logic) development — you can have deep technical conversations and make sound architectural decisions
* Proven experience as a Senior PM owning mobile/web applications or internal tools end\\-to\\-end
* Deep comfort with APIs/integrations, data flows, instrumentation/events, and logs — you can debug issues, review code, and ask the right technical questions
* Strong written communication: crisp specs, clear decisions, and structured thinking
* SQL or basic analytics skills required
* Must be available to work fully on\\-site at our Noida office



  





**Nice to Have** 



* Experience building SaaS or B2B internal tools from the ground up
* Experience in ops\\-heavy businesses (hospitality, real estate, co\\-living, logistics)
* Exposure to ticketing/workflow products, SOP\\-based execution systems, or SLA\\-driven operations
* Familiarity with DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure)



  





**First 90 Days Success Metrics** 



* Clear understanding of UniLiv's core workflows and pain points across properties
* Tech stack finalized and in\\-house application development underway
* Engineering team set up with a clear delivery cadence and accountability structure
* 2–4 shipped improvements with visible impact on resolution speed, reopen rate, or team adoption
* Clean taxonomy/status systems and measurable reporting for key operational metrics
