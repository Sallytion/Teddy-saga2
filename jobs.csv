 Blink Health is the fastest growing healthcare technology company that builds products to make prescriptions accessible and affordable to everybody.  Our two primary products – BlinkRx and Quick Save – remove traditional roadblocks within the current prescription supply chain, resulting in better access to critical medications and improved health outcomes for patients. 
 



 BlinkRx is the world’s first pharma\\-to\\-patient cloud that offers a digital concierge service for patients who are prescribed branded medications. Patients benefit from transparent low prices, free home delivery, and world\\-class support on this first\\-of\\-its\\-kind centralized platform. With BlinkRx, never again will a patient show up at the pharmacy only to discover that they can’t afford their medication, their doctor needs to fill out a form for them, or the pharmacy doesn’t have the medication in stock. 
 



 We are a highly collaborative team of builders and operators who invent new ways of working in an industry that historically has resisted innovation. Join us!
 


**About the Role** 

 You are an engineer who, above all, is excited to build products that give our customers the best possible experience purchasing prescription medications. You have professional experience working on a team turning ideas into reliable, maintainable code — and ideally, you are eager to apply

 to make healthcare more accessible, affordable, and personalized.
 



 We believe in using a small number of well\\-known tools like
 **AWS, Python, Javascript, MySQL/Postgres, and Linux** 
 . We are looking for engineers who value
 **simplicity, pragmatism, and a bias toward action** 
 , and who are passionate about building products that bring real value to our customers.
 



 Software Engineers at Blink are responsible for building our world\\-class products. Your job is to take ownership over one of our hardest problems, envision and refine strategic solutions, and drive execution like an entrepreneur.
 



 You will collaborate closely with a talented, cross\\-functional team of designers, product managers, data scientists, marketers, and operators. Through these partnerships, you’ll grow our business, build our core platform, and—above all—make sure that our customers have access to the least expensive and highest satisfaction pharmacy experience on earth.
 



 At Blink, we determine the specific focus of engineering roles through the interview process. Key potential areas of ownership include:
 


* Our telemedicine platform
* Our home delivery experience
* Our growth \\& personalization systems
* Our core pharmacy platform
* New product line development
* ****AI/ML\\-powered patient support, personalization, and automation****



 We’ll work with you to find the right fit.
 


**How to Achieve Success / Acumen** 

 All Blinkers are expected to operate with our value of
 *“Good Giving”* 
 in mind. Our culture is infused with the dedication and enthusiasm of employees who continuously strive to make a difference. Here’s how you will do that in this role:
 


**Good Execution — Do your best work** 
* Design and build new APIs to power innovative features
* Fix performance problems and debug production issues
* Perform peer code and architecture reviews
* Build new features, write unit tests, and lead the release of these features to production
* Develop and A/B test new
 **ReactJS components** 
 to improve our user experience
* ****Apply AI/ML techniques to optimize search, recommendations, pricing, telehealth workflows, and operational efficiency****


**Good Owner — Be the CEO of your role** 
* Help the team ship new products and features successfully with the right skills, mentorship, and organizational resources to deliver amazing experiences for our patients
* Coach, mentor, and develop engineers to reach individual goals while fostering cross\\-functional collaboration and product success
* Take responsibility for the long\\-term success of product projects and people
* ****Drive adoption of AI tools and frameworks across engineering and product teams****


**Good Learning — Learn something new every day** 
* Demonstrate curiosity and an interest in learning new techniques and improving upon best practices to stay up\\-to\\-date with current and emerging trends
* Lead by example: put new ideas into action, fail fast, and learn from each experience
* ****Experiment with cutting\\-edge AI/ML models, including LLMs, to enhance workflows and customer experience****


**Good Feedback — Consider the perspective of others** 
* Listen actively and respond effectively through a variety of channels
* Give and receive candid and constructive feedback
* Promote trust and encourage teamwork to allow the product team to do their best work


**Desired Experience** 
* 2\\+ years in a software engineering role
* Comfortable working in a highly collaborative environment: we believe a team can be stronger than its individual parts
* Independent, curious, and comfortable owning features from design through delivery to production
* Experience with one or more modern programming languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
* Willingness to dive into a large code base and contribute immediately
* Enjoy writing code that is understandable, maintainable, and testable
* Collaborative and communicative — you love being part of a diverse team, building consensus, and establishing credibility. You are a Class\\-A communicator: curious, thoughtful, clear, and (mostly) correct.
* BA/BS degree from a top institution; MBA or CompSci degree preferred but not required


**AI\\-Preferred Skills** 
* Experience with
 **AI/ML frameworks** 
 (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit\\-learn)

* Ability to leverage
 **AI for personalization, decision support, and automation**
* Experience integrating AI\\-driven solutions into production systems
* Strong interest in applying AI responsibly in healthcare for maximum patient benefit



**Why Join Us:** 




 It is rare to have a company that both deeply impacts its customers and is able to provide its services across a massive population.  At Blink, we have a huge impact on people when they are most vulnerable: at the intersection of their healthcare and finances. We are also the fastest growing healthcare company in the country and are driving that impact across millions of new patients every year.  Our business model not only helps people, but drives economics that allow us to build a generational company. We are a relentlessly learning, constantly curious, and aggressively collaborative cross\\-functional team dedicated to inventing new ways to improve the lives of our customers.

**About Pixxel**
 Pixxel is a space data company and spacecraft manufacturer redefining Earth observation with hyperspectral imaging. The company’s first three commercial hyperspectral satellites—Fireflies—deliver imagery at 5\\-meter resolution and 135\\+ spectral bands, providing 50x richer detail than traditional Earth observation systems and unlocking insights across agriculture, climate, energy, environment, and more.
   

  

 Once fully deployed, Pixxel’s constellation of 18\\-24 satellites will capture imagery across up to 250 bands in VNIR and SWIR ranges, with a 40 km swath and daily global revisit capability. Pixxel’s most unique strength is its full\\-stack approach, integrating every layer of the value chain from satellite hardware and manufacturing to AI\\-powered analytics.
   

  

 Pixxel’s satellite constellation is complemented by Aurora, its in\\-house Earth Observation Studio that simplifies satellite imagery analysis and democratises remote sensing for all. Designed to make hyperspectral data more accessible, Aurora by Pixxel combines high\\-frequency imagery with AI\\-powered tools to generate actionable insights, even for users without technical backgrounds. The third pillar of Pixxel’s ecosystem is its in\\-house satellite manufacturing capability. Beyond building its own spacecraft, Pixxel also provides satellite systems and subsystems to other organisations. This dual capacity sets it apart in a sector where most companies focus on either payload design or data operations, but not both.
   

  

 Pixxel’s team is young but deeply mission\\-aligned, with a culture rooted in curiosity, speed, and long\\-term thinking. As the company grows its constellation and expands Aurora, the focus remains on making space\\-based insights practical, scalable, and genuinely helpful so that the health of the planet becomes measurable and action becomes possible.
   

  

 Pixxel was the only Indian startup selected for the Techstars Starburst Space Accelerator in Los Angeles and has been recognised in TIME’s Best Inventions of 2023, Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, and Via Satellite’s Top Innovators list.
   

  

 For more information, see our Careers page or follow Pixxel on LinkedIn and X/Twitter.
   

  

 Culture
   

  

 Pixxel is an organisation where we enable our employees to work on world\\-changing problems that they are passionate about, and a place where they can be their best selves day in and day out while ensuring they have fun every day.
   

  

 Central to our employee\\-first ethos is a commitment to ensuring that every team member feels valued and heard. We nurture a healthy and supportive work environment where we prioritise well\\-being and growth in all aspects of life
