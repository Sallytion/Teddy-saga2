 **Product Engineer** 
 — a high\\-judgment, full\\-stack developer who thrives on owning products end\\-to\\-end. This role combines deep technical expertise with product sensibility, operational awareness, and fluency in modern AI\\-assisted development.
   

  

 As a Product Engineer, you'll design, build, deploy, and operate software that delivers real user and business value. You'll work in a small, high\\-trust team where individuals have broad responsibility — not just for delivering features, but for improving the platform, refining our practices, and shaping the team culture. Leadership here isn't a title; it's the initiative to make things better.
   

  

 This is not a narrow ""feature developer"" position — it's a role for those who think in systems, act with autonomy, and care about quality from concept to production.
   

  

 Key Responsibilities
   

  

**End\\-to\\-End Ownership:** 
 Design, build, deploy, monitor, and continuously improve product features across the full stack.
   

  

**Architecture \\& Systems Thinking:** 
 Lead or contribute to the design of scalable, secure, and maintainable systems — including APIs, data models, and deployment strategies.
   

  

**AI\\-Augmented Development:** 
 Use modern AI tools to accelerate coding, testing, documentation, and debugging while maintaining a high standard of quality and judgment.
   

  

**CI/CD \\& Operations:** 
 Build and manage automated CI/CD pipelines, monitor production health, and ensure reliability, observability, and cost efficiency.
   

  

**Production Mindset:** 
 You've been on\\-call and know what it takes to run reliable systems. You ship with confidence because you've built proper testing and monitoring.
   

  

**Product Mindset:** 
 Collaborate directly with product managers, designers, and scientists to understand user problems and translate them into elegant, working solutions.
   

  

**Code Quality \\& Testing:** 
 Maintain high coding standards, implement automated testing, and review peers' work to ensure system integrity and performance.
   

  

**Mentorship \\& Team Culture:** 
 Share knowledge, promote modern engineering practices, and contribute to a culture of learning, speed, and continuous improvement.
   

  

**Security \\& Compliance:** 
 Implement security best practices and support regulated development standards appropriate to our domain.
   

  

**Qualifications**
**Experience:** 
 10\\+ years of software development, with demonstrable ownership of deployed systems and production services.
   

  

**Technical Breadth:** 
 Strong experience with both front\\-end (React, TypeScript, HTML/CSS) and back\\-end (Node.js, PHP, C\\#, or Python) development.
   

  

**System Design:** 
 Proven ability to design scalable, maintainable, and observable distributed systems.
   

  

**CI/CD Expertise:** 
 Hands\\-on experience with modern CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, or similar) and infrastructure\\-as\\-code (Terraform, AWS CDK).
   

  

**Cloud Proficiency:** 
 Solid understanding of AWS services (EC2, Lambda, RDS, S3, etc.) and deployment architectures.
   

  

**AI Fluency:** 
 Experience leveraging AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, or similar) for development, testing, or data analysis.
   

  

**Database Skills:** 
 Strong SQL experience (PostgreSQL, MySQL) plus familiarity with NoSQL systems.
   

  

**Version Control:** 
 Proficient with Git and collaborative workflows (PRs, branching strategies, reviews).
   

  

**Testing Discipline:** 
 Comfortable with unit, integration, and end\\-to\\-end testing frameworks (Playwright, Jest, Cypress, xUnit, etc.).
   

  

**Agile Mindset:** 
 Experienced in fast, iterative delivery environments emphasizing learning, autonomy, and outcome over process.
   

  

**Communication:** 
 Able to articulate complex technical topics clearly, and collaborate effectively across disciplines.
   

  

**Nice to Have:**
 Experience with event\\-driven or microservices architectures
   

  

 Familiarity with observability tools (Datadog, Prometheus, ELK)
   

  

 Knowledge of machine learning or AI integration patterns
   

  

 Contributions to open\\-source or internal developer\\-tooling initiatives
   

  

 Interest in Lean, DevOps, or Continuous Delivery principles (Humble/Farley, Forsgren, O'Reilly)
   

  

**What Success Looks Like:**
 You deliver features that make it all the way to production — tested, monitored, and loved by users
   

  

 You improve velocity without sacrificing quality
   

  

 You use AI tools effectively to multiply your output and reduce friction
   

  

 You take initiative to fix what's broken, simplify what's complex, and ship what matters
   

  

 You elevate your peers through mentorship, clarity, and example","Biotechnology Research","https://www.linkedin.com/company/revvity","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQHZOvNJkXwzNg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1683629178328/revvity_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=FfGfuLTdTLczGgc0nxopoo92a-C6Uo9jBgpLS-B1wik","","","","","","","","","","",""
