**About The Team**
 Our 40\\+ engineering teams are working on designing, creating and running the rich product catalogue across our business areas (e.g. Payments Services, Business Services). We have a long roadmap ahead of us and always have interesting problems to tackle. We trust and empower our engineers to make real technical decisions that affect multiple teams and shape the future of Tide’s Global One Platform. It’s an exceptional opportunity to make a real difference by taking ownership of engineering practices in a rapidly expanding company!
   

  

 We work in small autonomous teams, grouped under common domains owning the full lifecycle of some microservices in Tide’s service catalogue. Our engineers self\\-organize, gather together to discuss technical challenges, and set their own guidelines in the different
 **Communities of Practice** 
 regardless of where they currently stand in our Growth Framework.
   

  

**About The Role**
* Contribute to our event\\-driven Microservice Architecture (currently 200\\+ services owned by 40\\+ teams). You will define and maintain the services your team owns (you design it, you build it, you run it, you scale it globally)
* Use Java 17, Spring Boot and JOOQ to build your services.
* Expose and consume RESTful APIs. We value good API design and we treat our APIs as Products (in the world of Open Banking often times they are gonna be public!)
* Use SNS\\+SQS and Kafka to send events
* Utilise PostgreSQL via Aurora as your primary datastore (we are heavy AWS users)
* Deploy your services to Production as often as you need to (this usually means multiple times per day!). This is enabled by our CI/CD pipelines powered by GitHub with GitHub actions, and solid JUnit/Pact testing (new joiners are encouraged to have something deployed to production in their first 2 weeks)

* Have DataDog as your best friend to monitor your services and investigate issues
* Collaborate closely with Product Owners to understand our Users’ needs, Business opportunities and Regulatory requirements and translate them into well\\-engineered solutions


**What We Are Looking For**
* Have some experience building server\\-side applications and detailed knowledge of the relevant programming languages for your stack. You don’t need to know Java, but bear in mind that most of our services are written in Java, so you need to be willing to learn it when you have to change something there!
* Have a sound knowledge of a backend framework (e.g. Spring/Spring Boot) that you’ve used to write microservices that expose and consume RESTful APIs
* Have experience engineering scalable and reliable solutions in a cloud\\-native environment (the most important thing for us is understanding the fundamentals of CI/CD, practical Agile so to speak)
* Demonstrate a mindset of delivering secure, well\\-tested and well\\-documented software that integrates with various third party providers and partners (we do that a lot in the fintech industry)


**Our Tech Stack**
* Java 17, Spring Boot and JOOQ to build the RESTful APIs of our microservices
* Event\\-driven architecture with messages over SNS\\+SQS and Kafka to make them reliable
* Primary datastores are MySQL and PostgreSQL via RDS or Aurora (we are heavy AWS users)
* Docker, Terraform, EKS/Kubernetes used by the Cloud team to run the platform
* DataDog, ElasticSearch/Fluentd/Kibana and Rollbar to keep it running
* GitHub with GitHub actions for Sonarcloud, Snyk and solid JUnit/Pact testing to power the CI/CD pipelines


**What You Will Get In Return**
* Competitive Compensation \\- competitive salary and share options
* Time Off – Generous annual leave on top of bank holidays.
* Parental Leave – Paid maternity, paternity, and adoption leave to support your family journey.
* Sabbatical – Extended unpaid and paid leave options after completing milestone years with Tide.
