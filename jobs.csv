**What are we looking for** 




 real solver?
 



**We identify better ways of doing things.** 




**Solver? Absolutely. But not the usual kind.** 
 We're searching for the architects of the audacious \\& the pioneers of the possible. If you're the type to dismantle assumptions, re\\-engineer ‘best practices,’ and build solutions that make the future possible NOW, then you're speaking our language.
 


* Improver. Solver. Futurist.
* Great sense of humor.
* ‘Possible. It is.’ Mindset.
* Compassionate collaborator. Bold experimenter. Tireless iterator.
* Natural creativity that doesn’t just challenge the norm, but solves to design what’s better.
* Thinks in systems. Solves at scale.
