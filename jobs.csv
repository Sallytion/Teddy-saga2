 We aren’t looking for someone who just followed a syllabus. We want the person who stayed up until 3:00 AM because they wanted to see if they could make an app talk to an API, or the person who learned a new language just to automate a boring task. If you have a GitHub full of ""unfinished\\-but\\-cool"" projects or a live app that you built just to see if you could, we want to talk to you.
 



  





**What you’ll be doing:\\-** 




 ● Building \\& Breaking: Writing clean, scalable code while understanding that breaking things is part of the learning process.
 



 ● System Exploration: Working across different layers of the stack—from frontend UI to backend logic and database management.
 



 ● Collaborative Problem Solving: Working with a team that values ""how it works"" as much as ""that it works.""
 



 ● Rapid Learning: Shifting between languages or frameworks as the project demands.
 



  





**Who you are (The ""Must\\-Haves"")** 




 ● Self\\-Taught Spirit: You’ve explored at least one technology, language, or system outside of your required coursework.
 



 ● The ""Artifact"" Factor: You have something to show. This could be a personal website, a mobile app, a scraper, a game, or a contribution to an open\\-source project.
 



 ● Curiosity\\-Driven: You don’t just use a library; you want to know how it handles data under the hood.
 



 ● Technical Foundation: Solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and at least one programming language (Python, JS, Java, Rust, Go, etc.).
 



  





**Bonus points if you...** 




 ● Have a GitHub, GitLab, or personal blog you’re proud of.
 



 ● Have experimented with cloud services (AWS/Firebase/Vercel).
 



 ● Can explain a technical concept to a non\\-technical person without using too much jargon.","Software Development","https://in.linkedin.com/company/xfilespro","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHiZ32is8ZD5g/company-logo_100_100/B56ZuNuHcHJEAQ-/0/1767609235793/xfilespro_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=VAcod5ii9VXf4ZssbtdI0GAxPdAvp5C6qNeIdkv8eMI","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Autonomous systems need to make decisions, learn from feedback, and adapt their behavior over time. That's where Reinforcement Learning (RL) comes in. But not in a naive way: How do we design reward structures that actually work? Where does RL fail? How do we build systems that are capable, controllable and adaptable to new environments?
 



  





 You'll research these questions. Understand the frontier. Push it forward.
 



  





  





**What You'll Do** 




  




* **Own research direction in agentic behavior** 
 . Design how models learn to act, adapt and plan: what reward structures work, what exploration strategies matter, and how failure modes arise.
* **Understand where RL works and fails** 
 . You’ve seen RL systems succeed and break, know the patterns, and bring intuition about what to watch for.
* **Design for safety and controllability from the ground up** 
 . Build alignment into the RL approach, not as a patch.
* **Collaborate across the stack** 
 . Your research informs how RL integrates into training strategy and systems design.
* **Ship research fast** 
 . Design experiments, run them, learn, adjust. Research velocity matters as much as rigor.



  





  





**Who You Are** 




  





**Core** 



* Deep expertise in reinforcement learning: algorithms, reward design, exploration, and policy learning.
* Have shipped RL systems that live in the real\\-world: you understand the critical path from simulation to deployment and know what matters for transfer.
* Strong mathematical foundation: you reason rigorously about algorithms.
* Analyze rigorously which approaches work or fail, and why: you can ablate and debug systematically.
* Real\\-world agent debugging experience; robotics background is a huge plus.
* Experience with RL libraries and custom environment integration (Gymnasium, Brax, Isaac Gym): you know how to bridge algorithmic theory and real\\-world complexity.



  





**Representative experience paths (one or more)** 



* PhD in RL, Control, or Robotics \\+ 1\\-2 years shipping RL systems.
* 5\\+ years doing RL work in industry or labs.
* 3\\+ years at major AI labs doing this work.



  





*These are broad experience signals, not strict requirements. If this role excites you, we’d rather talk than have you self\\-select out.* 




  





**Mindset** 



* You think rigorously about algorithms and systems.
* You’re practical: you understand failure modes and how to avoid them.
* You’re safety\\-conscious: you think about misalignment and reward hacking.
* You take ownership and solve problems hands\\-on.



  





  





**How to Apply** 




  





 Email 
 **hello@wiseport.ai** 
  with:
 


1. **Resume/CV**
2. **A hard RL problem you solved** 
  (2\\-3 sentences)


* A time RL broke and how you debugged it
* OR a reward structure you designed and unexpected lessons learned



 3\\.
 **Why this excites you** 
  (2 sentences)
 


* Why RL in agentic AI systems?



 4\\.
 **Links** 
 (optional)
 


* Papers, GitHub, robotics work, anything showing your RL thinking.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://in.linkedin.com/company/wiseport-ai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGgpRZZk8E4ww/company-logo_100_100/B56ZpJlCB2I0AQ-/0/1762171036263?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0hOWmL-gi9ScdBDCddmJ9W58gQU6d-UDRluzIFUEzyo","","","","","","","","","","",""
