 At 1% Club, we’re on a mission to build India’s most trusted wealth\\-tech platform, one that doesn’t just stop at financial products, but brings education, advisory, and execution together in a way no one else has.
   

  

 In less than two years, we’ve managed to launch and scale our EdTech vertical, secure our
 **RIA SEBI license** 
 , and build an
 **8M\\+** 
 strong online following of India’s English\\-speaking middle class.
   

  

 We’ve done all of this with industry\\-level low CACs, strong brand love, and consumer trust, while staying profitable.
   

  

 We are backed by Gruhas, a fund by
 **Zerodha’s Nikhil Kamath** 
 and Puzzolana Group’s
 **Abhijeet Pai.**
 💪 What’s Next
   

  

 We’re Now Entering Our Most Exciting Chapter Yet, Where The Foundations We’ve Built Start Compounding Into Real Scale. Our Next Phase Is Anchored Around Three Core Pillars
   

  

* EdTech – Expanding our financial education ecosystem through online and offline initiatives. We’re making finance simple, accessible, and actionable for millions of Indians.
* Advisory – Democratising high\\-quality financial advice. From first\\-time earners to high\\-income families, we’re reimagining how India accesses unbiased financial guidance.
* AI Co\\-pilot for Money – Building India’s most seamless AI\\-powered money dashboard. By helping users track and analyse all their finances in one place, we want to deliver powerful insights and make financial independence truly actionable.

 🤝 Why Join Us
   

  

 Our best learnings came from doing zero\\-to\\-one journeys of building some great products out there. Hence, we truly understand the impact of joining a team from an early stage and growing with it.
   

  

 We’re at an early but exciting stage, where every line of code, every design, and every idea directly shapes the future of how Indians think about money.
   

  

 🎯 What will you do?
   

  

 You’ll be working on the core systems behind a platform that's redefining how millions of Indians manage their money, with real\\-time applications, AI copilots, and blazing\\-fast apps.
   

  

 You’ll have end\\-to\\-end ownership of features, working directly with the CTO and founding team to take ideas from whiteboard to production.
   

  

 We care less about what stack you’ve used and more about how you think. You should be fluid across tech, know the “why” behind every decision, and treat speed and stability like religion. If you can write clean code, debug production like a ninja, and nerd out on system\\-level optimization, we’d love to have you.
   

  

 Key Responsibilities
   

  

* Design, develop, and maintain robust microservices in GoLang, with clean abstractions, high reliability, and readiness for scale.

* Work hard, Party harder: Company offsite, team lunch/dinner, game nights, and day outings are a few of the many things you’ll experience if you work out of the Bengaluru office.

 Based in San Francisco, California, Turing is the world’s leading research accelerator for frontier AI labs and a trusted partner for global enterprises deploying advanced AI systems. Turing supports customers in two ways: first, by accelerating frontier research with high\\-quality data, advanced training pipelines, plus top AI researchers who specialize in coding, reasoning, STEM, multilinguality, multimodality, and agents; and second, by applying that expertise to help enterprises transform AI from proof of concept into proprietary intelligence with systems that perform reliably, deliver measurable impact, and drive lasting results on the P\\&L
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 We are seeking an AI Prompt \\& Policy Specialist to help design, evaluate, and improve how AI systems interact with tools, APIs, and users across multiple locales. In this role, you will work at the intersection of prompt engineering, policy design, and safety, ensuring that AI\\-driven workflows are accurate, compliant, and user\\-friendly.
 



 You will use your API/JSON literacy, SQL basics, policy creation skills, and strong critical reasoning to review, refine, and design prompts and behaviors for AI systems interacting with products like Slack, PayPal, and other third\\-party tools. This role also requires strong communication skills and awareness of safety and content filtering, especially across a wide range of languages and locales.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day life look like?** 



* Design, review, and refine prompts and instructions for AI systems interacting with tools, APIs, and external services.
* Read and understand API/JSON schemas and arguments to ensure correct parameter usage and tool behavior.
* Apply SQL basics to validate data, perform simple checks, and support analysis of AI or tool behavior.
* Create, document, and maintain policies and guidelines governing AI interactions, content handling, and tool workflows.
* Develop workflow knowledge for specific tools (e.g., Slack, PayPal and similar platforms) and encode that into prompts and policies.
* Ensure safety and compliance by applying content filtering guidelines and detecting unsafe or non\\-compliant outputs.
* Evaluate AI responses for critical reasoning quality, correctness of parameters, and adherence to policies.
* Support multilingual use cases by validating prompts and responses across multiple locales, with attention to nuance and clarity.
* Collaborate with product, engineering, and safety teams to iterate on prompts, policies, and workflows based on evaluation findings.
* Document edge cases, decision rationales, and recommendations with clear, concise written communication.



  





**Requirements:** 



* **3–6 years of experience in any combination of:** 
 AI operations, content review, QA, product operations, policy, or technical support roles.
* **Strong API / JSON literacy:** 
 ability to read schemas, understand arguments, and verify correct parameter usage.
* **SQL basics:** 
 ability to run simple queries to validate data, investigate issues, or support analysis.
* Demonstrated experience with prompt engineering or writing clear, structured instructions for AI or automation systems.
* **Proven policy creation skills:** 
 drafting, interpreting, and applying guidelines or policies in an operational setting.
* Familiarity with tool\\-specific workflows (e.g., Slack, PayPal, or similar SaaS platforms), including typical user actions and edge cases.
* Strong communication skills, with the ability to write clear, concise rationales and explanations; comfort working with multilingual contexts across many locales.
* High safety awareness for content filtering, including sensitivity to harmful, abusive, or policy\\-violating content.
* Excellent critical reasoning and judgment, especially when evaluating ambiguous or complex cases.
* Strong attention to detail, particularly in checking parameters, arguments, and compliance with specified schemas or policies.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing:** 



* Work in a fully remote environment.
* Opportunity to work on cutting\\-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.



  





**Offer Details:** 



* **Commitments Required:** 
 At least 4 hours per day and minimum 20 hours per week with overlap of 4 hours with PST.
