**What You’ll Do**
* Lead technical discovery and solution design with OEM and fleet engineering teams; define end‑to‑end vehicle‑to‑cloud architectures using DCP for OTA, data logging, diagnostics, and safe remote commands.
* Own OTA strategy and safety: design campaign orchestration, staging/rollout, rollback and recovery, bootloader and partitioning strategies, and update dependencies across ECU networks using Deep Updater.
* Define data strategies with Deep Logger: specify signals, triggers, sampling rates, and retention; balance bandwidth, cost, and fidelity; enable fleet‑scale analytics and engineering workflows.
* Operationalize remote commands with Deep Commander: model command catalogs, guardrails, permissions, and auditability for field operations, diagnostics, and service use cases.
* Map solutions to regulations and standards: guide customers on meeting WP.29/UNECE R155 (cybersecurity) and R156 (software updates) obligations and prepare artifacts for CSMS/SUMS audits.
* Run POCs and pilots: plan success criteria, lead integrations on gateway/telematics ECUs, and de‑risk production rollouts with measurable outcomes and handover plans.
* Create enablement: author reference architectures, playbooks, and best practices; deliver workshops for internal teams, partners, and customers.
* Be the field’s voice into Product: synthesize feedback from deployments; influence roadmaps for reliability, diagnostics depth, observability, and developer experience.
* Support go‑to‑market: contribute to RFPs/SOWs, quantify value (quality, uptime, warranty, and TCO impact), and present technical material to senior engineering and compliance stakeholders.
* Champion interoperability: advise on integrations with customer clouds and partner ecosystems (e.g., Azure/GCP), data lakes, and enterprise systems.


**What You Should Know**
* 8\\+ years in automotive or embedded connectivity, including 3\\+ years designing OTA, telematics, or connected‑vehicle platforms at OEMs, Tier‑1s, or mobility fleets.
* Deep familiarity with vehicle networking \\& diagnostics: CAN/CAN‑FD, automotive Ethernet, SOME/IP; diagnostics protocols (UDS, DoIP, ISO‑TP) and their practical use in update and logging flows.
* Handson knowledge of OTA safety and reliability: fail‑safe/rollback patterns, secure boot/bootloaders, package signing, campaign gating, and ECU dependency management.
* Experience mapping systems to UNECE R155/R156 and preparing CSMS/SUMS evidence; working knowledge of ISO/SAE 21434 and ISO 24089 concepts.
* Cloud \\& data fluency: designing data pipelines (streaming \\& batch), data governance/retention, API design, observability, and secure device‑to‑cloud comms.
* Tooling: Vector/CANoe, Wireshark, protocol analyzers; issue tracking and documentation tools.
* Excellent communication—able to whiteboard complex ideas with architects one day and brief executives the next; comfortable with customer‑facing roles and light travel.


**Perks Of Joining The Sibros Team**
* You will work with an awesome team where work culture is built to help you grow and have sense of full responsibility and accountability on a daily basis
* You will have opportunities to work with industry veterans and high profile OEM customers in the connected vehicle technology space
