**Purpose Statement** 




 The AI/ML Engineer will lead the design and implementation of advanced imaging algorithms for a next\\-generation healthcare platform focused on 3D reconstruction from medical modalities such as TEE and CT. This role involves applying state\\-of\\-the\\-art machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques to enhance medical image understanding, segmentation, and reconstruction. The candidate will collaborate with cross\\-functional teams including frontend, backend, QA, DevOps, and clinicians to build AI\\-driven imaging solutions.
 







**Key Responsibilities** 







* Design, develop, and optimize AI/ML algorithms for medical image analysis, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction from TEE and CT images.
* Research and implement advanced deep learning architectures including CNNs, GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models for medical imaging tasks.
* Develop robust 3D reconstruction pipelines from 2D image data and multi\\-view geometries, tailored to medical imaging workflows.
* Perform multimodal image registration (CT\\-CT, CT\\-MRI, Fluro\\-Endo, 2D\\-3D) and develop tools for alignment, calibration, and fusion.
* Enhance and denoise medical images using advanced computer vision and AI\\-based enhancement techniques.
* Work extensively with DICOM data, integrating with PACS systems for data ingestion and retrieval.
* Collaborate with teams for dataset curation, labeling, and ground truth generation.
* Develop scalable training and inference pipelines on cloud platforms (AWS preferred; Azure/GCP acceptable).
* Ensure reproducibility and traceability in experiments using MLOps practices (Docker, MLflow, or similar).
* Collaborate with software engineers to integrate AI components into production\\-grade imaging applications.
* Document research findings, maintain version\\-controlled repositories, and contribute to technical publications or IP filings.
* Stay up\\-to\\-date with emerging trends in AI, computer vision, and medical imaging technologies.



**Role Requirements** 



* Bachelor’s, Master’s, or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Data Science, Biomedical Engineering, or related field with focus on AI, ML, or Computer Vision.
* 8\\+ years of hands\\-on experience in AI/ML model development with strong exposure to computer vision and imaging applications.
* Expert\\-level proficiency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.
* Experience in 2D and 3D medical imaging (CT, MRI, Ultrasound, TEE) and DICOM data handling.
* Strong understanding of 3D geometry, camera calibration, stereo vision, and multi\\-view reconstruction.
* Experience in segmentation, registration, and object tracking within medical image contexts.
* Proficiency with classical computer vision techniques (OpenCV, PCL, feature detection, structure\\-from\\-motion, SLAM, etc.).
* Knowledge of generative and reconstruction models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models) and fine\\-tuning methods for domain\\-specific applications.
* Experience with data preprocessing, augmentation, and pipeline automation for large\\-scale medical datasets.
* Familiarity with MLOps, containerization (Docker), and deployment workflows for cloud and edge environments.
* Experience using cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP) for model training and large dataset management.
* Strong software engineering fundamentals — version control (Git), testing, CI/CD, and documentation practices.
* Excellent analytical, communication, and collaboration skills with a strong commitment to quality and compliance in healthcare development.


 Preferred / Secondary Skills
 * Experience in endoscopy imaging, image mosaicing, and fusion with ultrasound imaging.
