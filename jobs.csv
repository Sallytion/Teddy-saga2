 🧬
 



 Today over 1\\.78 million of small and medium\\-sized businesses in Europe alone need to be compliant with information security frameworks to be able to sell their products and services to enterprise customers.
 



 Secfix automates security compliance for SMBs in Europe. We help SMBs automate ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks instead of months. Our platform integrates with a company’s tech stack (like AWS, Azure AD, Jira, etc.), automatically extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain compliant.
 



 We grew fast and are looking for skilled engineers to help us improve and scale our product. Check our culture guide.
 



  





**Why you should join Secfix** 




 Secfix is an early\\-stage fully remote startup in the best sense of the word. We’re a fun, close\\-knit team on a mission to become the European compliance automation leader.
 



 We grew from 0 revenue to \\>1M$ ARR within two years and most of our costs are already covered by revenue. Now we are looking to grow further and faster.
 



 Our trajectory is backed by top investors (4\\.4M$ raised), including Octopus Ventures, Neosfer (Commerzbank), founders of Signavio and many more angels.
 



 As a Senior Backend Engineer, you will help shape and build every product we deliver to real customers: CTOs, COOs and engineering teams of small and medium businesses. You will also be part of growing a high\\-performance fully remote software startup.
 



  





**Who are we looking for?** 




 We're building an environment at Secfix where ambitious, independent engineers can thrive. We want to grow with people who take pride in building actual products, who are curious about how the features we ship are used daily — and who bring a design\\-first mindset (plan before coding) to ensure scalable, maintainable systems. We own products and outcomes, not Jira tickets.
 



 We understand that startup life can be demanding, but we believe it doesn’t have to be stressful. Bring your commitment and drive to grow, and we’ll deliver an environment that keeps you happy, healthy, and empowered to do your best work with us.
 



  





 You 
 **should** 
  apply if:
 


* You’re ambitious, independent and growth\\-oriented
* You’re comfortable with startup life ambiguity, adapting to changing priorities based on customer and market feedback, and wearing multiple hats
* You bring senior talent to our team with 5\\+ years of equivalent experience
* You’re comfortable collaborating and communicating in a remote environment, especially in writing and with Loom. You understand that working independently doesn't mean working alone. Remember, it requires more pro\\-active communication than working in the office
* You can mentor other developers and do code reviews.
* You know how to balance speed and quality and how to build leverage in your work through automation, abstractions and good software design and architecture
* You’re excited not only to use AI tools like Cursor, or Claude Code consciously — not just for speed, but for better design, refactoring, and testing but also building AI tools.
