**About The Role**

 in annual transactions for millions of SMEs. Our SDE V (Staff) is the technical force‑multiplier who
 **sets the architecture** 
 ,
 **raises the reliability bar** 
 , and
 **multiplies team effectiveness** 
 . You’ll steward our core payments models—
 **subscriptions, payments , reconciliation , tax** 
 —and the services around them, ensuring
 **correctness by design, auditability, and delightful performance at scale** 
 . This is an
 **IC role with org‑level influence** 
 (no direct reports), focused on designing systems, shaping standards, and growing engineers.
   

  

**Stack:Backend:** 
 Go, ConnectRPC, Buf
   

  

**Frontend:** 
 Vue.js , Vite, Webpack MFA, TanStack Query
   

  

**Databases:** 
 MongoDB, Firestore, ClickHouse
   

  

**Cloud:** 
 GCP (GKE), Pub/Sub, Redis, OpenTelemetry
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Architect and ship multi‑tenant, planet‑scale services (checkout, subscriptions, payments orchestration, invoicing, tax hooks) with clear domain boundaries (DDD) and hard SLOs.
* Be the custodian of API \\& schema design: own protobuf/ConnectRPC conventions, versioning policy, deprecation playbooks, and Buf breaking‑change checks—so our contracts stand the test of time.
* Guarantee resilience \\& availability of core payment paths: timeouts, retries with jitter, circuit breakers, idempotency keys, outbox/Saga patterns, hedged requests, and graceful degradation.
* Ensure complete auditability: append‑only double‑entry ledger, immutable event streams, trace‑linked entities (OTel trace/span IDs), tamper‑evident trails, and reconciliations that tie out to the cent.
* Own error boundaries end‑to‑end: enumerate failure domains (PSP, network, data, concurrency, quota, browser, device); design uniform error contracts; implement compensations/backfills and automated replay.
* Keep track of every deployed thing: services, workers, triggers, cron, subscriptions—own the service catalog and scorecards (owners, SLOs, runbooks, PDBs, HPA/VPA, budgets, quotas, timeouts).
* Configuration \\& limits stewardship: enforce sane defaults across GKE, Pub/Sub, Redis, Firestore/Mongo, ClickHouse—connection pools, ack deadlines, batch sizes, TTLs, memory/FD limits, and GCP quotas.
* Observability as a product: pervasive OpenTelemetry, RED/USE metrics, exemplars, trace sampling, SLO dashboards, and alerting that wakes humans only for user‑impacting issues.
* Production excellence: canary/blue‑green rollouts, automated rollbacks, chaos drills, DR playbooks (RPO/RTO), multi‑region failover strategies, and incident command on rotation.
* Security \\& compliance by design: PCI scope minimization, tokenization/vaulting, secrets/KMS hygiene, data retention/archival, and privacy controls—embed checks in CI/CD.
* Developer acceleration: pave golden paths (service templates, ADR/RFC process, linting/formatting, contract tests, ephemeral envs, load/perf harnesses) to make the right thing the easy thing


**What You’ll Lead**
* Core domain evolution: orchestration → ledger → reconciliation flows with crisp invariants and consistency guarantees (read‑your‑writes where needed, eventual where appropriate).
* Reliability strategy: SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, capacity planning, cost/FinOps guardrails, multi‑region posture, and DR exercises.
* API \\& data governance: canonical models, schema lifecycle (compatibility matrix, migrations), data lifecycle (retention, archival, compliance).
* Practice leadership for HighLevel: design reviews, postmortems, technical strategy, coding standards, and mentorship across teams—raise the bar for the org.
* Hiring \\& team growth: help us hire, scale, and train the right team; shape interview loops, rubrics, onboarding, and ongoing learning (brown bags, reviews, pair design).
* Cross‑functional partnership: collaborate with Product/Marketing/Support to translate platform capabilities and constraints into roadmaps, GTM narratives, and reliable customer outcomes.
* Risk \\& roadmap: maintain a technical risk register, make build‑vs‑buy calls, and propose simplifications or deprecations that meaningfully reduce complexity and MTTR.


**Minimum Qualifications**
* 10\\+ years building and operating backend systems (at least 5\\+ years in Go), with 2–3\\+ years acting as a Staff/Principal‑level IC or Tech Lead for critical paths.
* Deep proficiency with protobuf \\+ ConnectRPC/gRPC and API lifecycle management (versioning, compatibility, contract testing, Buf).
* Distributed systems fundamentals: idempotency, exactly‑once‑ish via dedupe/outbox, ordering, consensus basics, backpressure, concurrency control.
* Event‑driven architectures on GCP (Pub/Sub), plus Redis for fast paths; strong schema design in MongoDB/Firestore and analytics/reporting patterns on ClickHouse.
* Kubernetes/GKE operations at scale: autoscaling (HPA/VPA), PDBs, resource limits/requests, multi‑region topologies, CI/CD, canary/blue‑green.
* Reliability engineering: SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, capacity \\& load testing, incident management, DR/BCP.
* Security \\& compliance: secrets/KMS best practices, PCI basics (scope reduction, key rotation), and data governance (retention/archival).
* Testing discipline: unit, integration, contract, property‑based, performance; test data management and deterministic environments.
* Frontend collaboration: solid understanding of Vue.js \\+ TanStack Query to shape clean API surfaces and performance budgets across the boundary.
* Exceptional technical writing \\& communication: design docs, ADRs/RFCs, postmortems, and stakeholder updates.


**Nice to have**
* Hands‑on integrations with major PSPs/local rails (e.g., UPI, wallets, BNPL, cards/3DS2\\) and reconciliation at scale.
* Experience with active‑active or multi‑region designs; chaos engineering; traffic management.
* Observability leadership with OpenTelemetry at org scale (tail‑based sampling, exemplars).
* FinOps experience: cost baselining, quotas, budget alarms, and workload right‑sizing.
* Familiarity with regulatory frameworks (PCI DSS, SOC 2/ISO 27001\\) and privacy laws relevant to our markets.


**How We Work**
* Pragmatic architecture with a bias to ship, measure, iterate.
* High ownership, low ego: design docs, incident reviews, data‑driven decisions.
* Product‑first mindset: we sweat the merchant and buyer experience.
* IC leadership: influence through design, docs, prototypes, and mentorship—not headcount.
