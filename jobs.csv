**What You’ll Do**
* Build tools, APIs, and platforms to improve reliability, deployment, and performance.
* Architect and scale Kubernetes\\-based infrastructure for high\\-performance workloads (including GPU).
* Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code in Python, Go, or similar languages.
* Own and evolve CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure\\-as\\-code systems (Terraform, Helm), and service observability.
* Troubleshoot and resolve complex system, network, and application\\-level issues.
* Participate in blameless incident response, root cause analysis, and reliability reviews.


**What You Bring**
**Core Requirements:**
* 6–8 years of experience in SRE, DevOps, or platform engineering roles.
* Strong development background with fluency in Python, Go, or similar languages.
* Solid understanding of Kubernetes internals, workload orchestration, and Helm.
* Deep knowledge of networking fundamentals: DNS, TCP/IP, routing, VPNs, firewalls.
* Experience with infrastructure automation and configuration management.
* Understanding of GPU scheduling, resource allocation, and NVIDIA ecosystem tools.
* Familiarity with service mesh, observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry), and cloud\\-native patterns.


**Bonus Points:**
* Experience supporting AI/ML pipelines, especially GPU\\-based training/inference.
* Contributions to open\\-source projects or internal developer platforms.


**Why This Role**
* You’ll write software, not just YAML.
* You’ll get to work on real AI infrastructure challenges (not just buzzwords).
* You’ll have impact across developer productivity, platform scalability, and service reliability.
* You’ll join a team that values code quality, systems thinking, and ownership.
