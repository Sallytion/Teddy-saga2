 Arista's Network Detection and Response (NDR) platform is a mission\\-critical security tool for our customers. Its reliability is paramount. We are hiring a mid\\-level, Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) to join our team. This role is critical to the evolution of our customer\\-facing infrastructure and operational posture.
 



  





**What You’ll Do:** 




  





 This is not a traditional operations role. You will inherit a set of critical, manual, and hands\\-on operational responsibilities essential to our customers' success. We need you to help with the effort to systematically dismantle this operational burden through automation, tooling, and systems. You will have a collaborative team of excellent engineers to work with.
 



 The short\\-term needs are: manual deployments, reactive troubleshooting, and on\\-call escalations. But we need you to help us build a system where programmatic solutions have replaced human intervention. You must have the pragmatism to manage the current reality and the systematic impatience and technical skill to build its replacement.
 



 Success in this role requires a dual mindset. You must be a skilled incident leader who can stabilize a crisis and a deliberate systems architect who can prevent the next one. You will work closely with our internal tools, platform, and product engineering teams to channel your direct operational knowledge into durable, long\\-term solutions.
 



  





**Your First Year and Beyond** 




  





 Your work will follow a deliberate trajectory from reactive execution to proactive design.
 



 Phase 1: Stabilize and Map \\- You will embed with the team, taking on the existing operational workload alongside the other customer SRE team members covering the USA and India time zones. This includes customer deployments, upgrades, and incident response. You will be expected to go on\\-site for our airgapped customers, occasionally, to assist on\\-prem deployments. Your initial goal is to achieve stability while mapping the landscape of our operational toil.
 



 Phase 2: Automate and Influence \\- Armed with your map of toil, you will begin to automate.

**Senior Shopify Engineer**
 We are seeking a Senior Shopify Engineer with lead potential to architect enterprise\\-level commerce solutions and steer our technical direction. This role requires a blend of deep frontend mastery and sophisticated backend integration skills, combined with the ability to navigate complex problem statements and mentor a growing development team.
   

  

**Role Overview**
 As a Senior Shopify Engineer, you will bridge the gap between business requirements and technical architecture. You will collaborate closely with our Lead Architect to contribute to technical discovery sessions, design custom integrations for Shopify Plus merchants, and own the development of the most complex platform features. A core part of this role involves technical leadership: you will navigate the solution path for complex projects, groom technical stories, and delegate specific implementation tasks to the Shopify Engineering team.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Collaborative Discovery: Work alongside the Architect during client\\-facing discovery sessions to identify technical risks and opportunities. Use your depth of experience to guide conversations and translate merchant needs into robust technical roadmaps.
* Advanced Development: Act as the primary developer for the most difficult and nuanced project components. You are expected to be hands\\-on, developing complex solutions rather than simply handing off designs.
* Backlog Grooming \\& Handoff: Define technical tasks and specifications for Shopify Engineers. Groom user stories into actionable development tasks, providing the necessary technical context for the base engineering team to succeed.
* Solution Architecture: Contribute to the technical design of enterprise\\-scale Shopify Plus stores, making critical decisions on theme architecture vs. custom app builds vs. third\\-party integrations.
* Advanced Integrations: Architect and implement secure connections between Shopify and enterprise systems (ERPs, CRMs, OMS, and PIMs) using GraphQL and REST APIs.
* Shopify Plus Mastery: Spearhead the implementation of advanced Plus features, including Checkout Extensibility, Shopify Functions, B2B logic, and complex metaobject architectures.
* Performance \\& Security: Support and help drive the end\\-to\\-end performance strategy and security posture for high\\-volume stores, ensuring scalability during peak traffic events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday).


**Required Skills \\& Experience**
* 5\\+ years of professional frontend or full\\-stack experience, with at least 3 years dedicated to the Shopify platform.
* Advanced Platform Knowledge: Expert\\-level mastery of Shopify Plus, including its limitations and extensibility points.
* API Expertise: Deep experience with the Shopify GraphQL Admin API and Storefront API.
* Backend Proficiency: Ability to build and maintain custom Shopify apps (Node.js/Remix or similar) or middleware when off\\-the\\-shelf solutions are insufficient.
* Modern Tooling: Expertise in Shopify CLI, CI/CD pipelines for commerce, and advanced Git workflows.
* Strategic Problem Solving: Proven track record of solving ""non\\-standard"" commerce problems that require moving beyond Liquid templates.


**Architectural Leadership**
* Technology Selection: Ability to articulate the trade\\-offs between different technical approaches (e.g., Headless vs. Hydrogen vs. Liquid\\-first) to both internal teams and clients.
* Problem Finding: A proactive approach to identifying technical debt or performance bottlenecks before they impact the merchant’s bottom line.


**Soft Skills**
* Leadership \\& Delegation: Strong ability to break down complex project goals into actionable tasks for other developers.
* Client Consultation: Excellent communication skills to lead technical discussions with enterprise\\-level stakeholders.
* Decision Making: Confidence in making high\\-stakes technical choices and standing by them under project pressure.


**How to apply for this opportunity?**
* Step 1: Click On Apply! And Register or Login on our portal.

**Senior Shopify Engineer**
 We are seeking a Senior Shopify Engineer with lead potential to architect enterprise\\-level commerce solutions and steer our technical direction. This role requires a blend of deep frontend mastery and sophisticated backend integration skills, combined with the ability to navigate complex problem statements and mentor a growing development team.
   

  

**Role Overview**
 As a Senior Shopify Engineer, you will bridge the gap between business requirements and technical architecture. You will collaborate closely with our Lead Architect to contribute to technical discovery sessions, design custom integrations for Shopify Plus merchants, and own the development of the most complex platform features. A core part of this role involves technical leadership: you will navigate the solution path for complex projects, groom technical stories, and delegate specific implementation tasks to the Shopify Engineering team.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Collaborative Discovery: Work alongside the Architect during client\\-facing discovery sessions to identify technical risks and opportunities. Use your depth of experience to guide conversations and translate merchant needs into robust technical roadmaps.
* Advanced Development: Act as the primary developer for the most difficult and nuanced project components. You are expected to be hands\\-on, developing complex solutions rather than simply handing off designs.
* Backlog Grooming \\& Handoff: Define technical tasks and specifications for Shopify Engineers. Groom user stories into actionable development tasks, providing the necessary technical context for the base engineering team to succeed.
* Solution Architecture: Contribute to the technical design of enterprise\\-scale Shopify Plus stores, making critical decisions on theme architecture vs. custom app builds vs. third\\-party integrations.
* Advanced Integrations: Architect and implement secure connections between Shopify and enterprise systems (ERPs, CRMs, OMS, and PIMs) using GraphQL and REST APIs.
* Shopify Plus Mastery: Spearhead the implementation of advanced Plus features, including Checkout Extensibility, Shopify Functions, B2B logic, and complex metaobject architectures.
* Performance \\& Security: Support and help drive the end\\-to\\-end performance strategy and security posture for high\\-volume stores, ensuring scalability during peak traffic events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday).


**Required Skills \\& Experience**
* 5\\+ years of professional frontend or full\\-stack experience, with at least 3 years dedicated to the Shopify platform.
* Advanced Platform Knowledge: Expert\\-level mastery of Shopify Plus, including its limitations and extensibility points.
* API Expertise: Deep experience with the Shopify GraphQL Admin API and Storefront API.
* Backend Proficiency: Ability to build and maintain custom Shopify apps (Node.js/Remix or similar) or middleware when off\\-the\\-shelf solutions are insufficient.
* Modern Tooling: Expertise in Shopify CLI, CI/CD pipelines for commerce, and advanced Git workflows.
* Strategic Problem Solving: Proven track record of solving ""non\\-standard"" commerce problems that require moving beyond Liquid templates.


**Architectural Leadership**
* Technology Selection: Ability to articulate the trade\\-offs between different technical approaches (e.g., Headless vs. Hydrogen vs. Liquid\\-first) to both internal teams and clients.
* Problem Finding: A proactive approach to identifying technical debt or performance bottlenecks before they impact the merchant’s bottom line.


**Soft Skills**
* Leadership \\& Delegation: Strong ability to break down complex project goals into actionable tasks for other developers.
* Client Consultation: Excellent communication skills to lead technical discussions with enterprise\\-level stakeholders.
* Decision Making: Confidence in making high\\-stakes technical choices and standing by them under project pressure.
