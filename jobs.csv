 Our systems operate at
 **exabyte scale** 
 , processing
 **petabytes of data each day** 
 for some of the world’s most prominent enterprises in finance, technology, and industry. These systems are already making a measurable difference in how global organizations use data to deploy AI safely and efficiently.
   

  

 We believe that the next generation of enterprise AI will not come from larger models but from
 **more efficient data systems** 
 . By advancing the frontier of how data is represented, stored, and transformed, we aim to make large\\-scale intelligence creation sustainable and adaptive.
   

  

 Our long\\-term vision is
 ***Efficient Intelligence***
 : AI that learns using fewer resources, generalizes from less data, and reasons through structure rather than scale. To reach that, we are first building the
 **Foundational Data Systems** 
 that make structured AI possible.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Infrastructure Design and Development: Design, build, and test the cloud\\-based infrastructure that supports Granica. AI's products, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance.
* CI/CD Pipeline Management: Build and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines and related tooling in line with DevOps best practices to accelerate development velocity and improve product quality.
* Kubernetes Operations: Manage deployments to multiple production Kubernetes clusters, ensuring high availability and seamless operation while handling scaling challenges.
* End\\-to\\-End Testing: Contribute to and maintain our E2E testing framework, ensuring quality assurance across the platform.
* Cross\\-Team Collaboration: Participate in design discussions and code reviews, collaborating across teams to ensure best practices in infrastructure, cloud architecture, and development processes.
* Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: Write technical documentation to share solutions, capture tribal knowledge, and communicate complex issues and novel solutions.
* Project Leadership: Lead and drive projects from conception through to implementation, demonstrating initiative and leadership in an early\\-stage company environment.


**WHY JOIN GRANICA**
 If you’ve helped build the modern data stack at a large company—Databricks, Snowflake, Confluent, or similar—you already know how critical lakehouse infrastructure is to AI and analytics at scale. At Granica, you’ll take that knowledge and apply it where it matters most…at the most fundamental layer in the data ecosystem.
   

  

* Own the product, not just the feature. At Granica, you won’t be optimizing edge cases or maintaining legacy systems. You’ll architect and build foundational components that define how enterprises manage and optimize data for AI.
* Move faster, go deeper. No multi\\-month review cycles or layers of abstraction—just high\\-agency engineering work where great ideas ship weekly. You’ll work directly with the founding team, engage closely with design partners, and see your impact hit production fast.
* Work on hard, meaningful problems. From transaction layer design in Delta and Iceberg, to petabyte\\-scale compaction and schema evolution, to adaptive indexing and cost\\-aware query planning—this is deep systems engineering at scale.
* Join a team of expert builders. Our engineers have designed the core internals of cloud\\-scale data systems, and we maintain a culture of peer\\-driven learning, hands\\-on prototyping, and technical storytelling.
* Core Differentiation: We’re focused on unlocking a deeper layer of AI infrastructure. By optimizing the way data is stored, processed, and retrieved, we make platforms like Snowflake and Databricks faster, more cost\\-efficient, and more AI\\-native. Our work sits at the most fundamental layer of the AI stack: where raw data becomes usable intelligence.
* Be part of something early—without the chaos. Granica has already secured $65M\\+ from NEA, Bain Capital Ventures, A\\* Capital, and legendary operators from Okta, Tesla, and Databricks.
* Grow with the company. You’ll have the chance to grow into a technical leadership role, mentor future hires, and shape both the engineering culture and product direction as we scale.


**Benefits**
* Highly competitive compensation with uncapped commissions and meaningful equity
* Immigration sponsorship and counseling
* Premium health, dental, and vision coverage
* Flexible remote work and unlimited PTO
* Quarterly recharge days and annual team off\\-sites
* Budget for learning, development, and conferences
* Help build the foundational infrastructure for the AI era


 Granica is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
   

  

**Why Granica**
* Fundamental Research Meets Enterprise Impact. Work at the intersection of science and engineering, turning foundational research into deployed systems serving enterprise workloads at exabyte scale.
* AI by Design. Build the infrastructure that defines how efficiently the world can create and apply intelligence.
* Real Ownership. Design primitives that will underpin the next decade of AI infrastructure.
* High\\-Trust Environment. Deep technical work, minimal bureaucracy, shared mission.
* Enduring Horizon. Backed by NEA, Bain Capital, and various luminaries from tech and business. We are building a generational company for decades, not quarters or a product cycle.


**Compensation \\& Benefits**
* Competitive salary, meaningful equity, and substantial bonus for top performers
* Flexible time off plus comprehensive health coverage for you and your family
* Support for research, publication, and deep technical exploration


**Join us to build the foundational data systems that power the future of enterprise AI.**
 At Granica, you will shape the fundamental infrastructure that makes intelligence itself efficient, structured, and enduring.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/granica-ai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQE4iFYys9slxQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1719949071189/granica_ai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=4IWgx7tDbkCmXRpXHLmKWpxB7e98uIQu6AgdGGWNU-g","","","","","","","","","","",""
