 Evaluate and improve agent performance. Move beyond basic accuracy metrics to measure ""agent trajectory"" quality, token usage efficiency, latency, and success rates in multi\\-step reasoning tasks.
* **Collaboration \\& Integration:** 
 Collaborate with software engineers to expose agents via APIs (e.g., FastAPI) and integrate them into existing product ecosystems. Explain agent decision\\-making processes (observability) to non\\-technical stakeholders.
* **Code Quality \\& Review:** 
 Contribute to design review sessions, specifically focusing on the maintainability of complex graph structures and state management. Provide feedback to peers on Python best practices and asynchronous programming.
* **Prompt Engineering \\& Fine\\-Tuning:** 
 Design sophisticated system prompts and manage prompt versioning. Occasionally fine\\-tune Small Language Models (SLMs) for specific domain tasks where latency or cost is a constraint.

 Founded in 2019 by Vishal Chopra and Himanshu Gupta, WeRize is building India’s largest full stack fintechplatform for 500 million underserved middle\\-class customers who live in 5000\\+ small towns of India. WeRize (Wortgage technologies pvt ltd) also owns RBI registered NBFC subsidiary (Wortgage Finance pvt ltd).
 



  





 This customer segmentis not served by privatesector banks, Insurersand Mutual Fund companies due to their low ticket\\-size and lifetime value and is dependent on PSU/Govt. banks. PSU/Government banks rarely provide financial products beyond basic savings accounts and these customers lack access to unsecured loans, MSME loans, credit cards, affordable housing loans, loan against property , health and life insurance and investment products. WeRize manufactures innovative unsecured consumer credit, mortgages, loan against property, MSME loans,savings and insurance products designed for this customer base keeping in mind their needs, requirements and purchasing power, with a view to add a layer of financial security to their lives and enable access to credit.
 



  





 While customers in these geographies use smartphones, they need properguidance and support when purchasing the right financial products for themselves. So, a pure digital model doesn’t work for this segment. WeRize has innovated on this front through its ‘Finance ki online dukaan (Social Shopify of Finance)’, a first of its kind social distribution tech platform in the financial services space that educates and enables local financially literate freelancers across these small towns to source business through online and offline channels, recommend the right financial product(s) to customers as well as provide after sales support.These freelancers, who are located in more than 5000\\+ towns and cities, earn as much as INR 30,000 a month from WeRize in commissions.
 



  





 Our social distribution platform supported by financially literatefreelancers means exceptionally low cost of customer acquisition (CAC) and operations costs compared to both fully digital and on\\-the\\-ground financial services providers. Digital conversions among this target group are way lower when comparedto upper income customers in metros and hence pure digital CAC doesn’t workfor this segment. While companies like LIC and Fino Bank also rely on freelancer distribution, they deploy local on\\-fieldteams/branches to manage freelancers in every city. That resultsin very high CAC and operations costs for such companies. WeRize on the other hand, has been able to acquire, train and manage thousandsof freelancers in 5000\\+ citiesonly through its tech platform and without any feet\\-on\\-street team of its own. This results in highly profitable business model for Werize.To know more about the company, please visti: https://www.weriz
