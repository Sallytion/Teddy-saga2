 Join the engineering team that is redefining how India understands food.
 



 At WHY Nutrition, technology isn’t a support function — it’s the backbone of everything we build. From
 *live food\\-score APIs* 
 that calculate nutrient ratings in real time, to the
 *SmartCoin wallet* 
 that gamifies healthy choices, our stack powers an ecosystem where food science meets everyday convenience.
 



 This role is for those who want to see their code make a tangible difference — in how people eat, shop, and think about nutrition.
   




**Role Overview** 

 As a
 **Junior Software Engineer** 
 , you will work closely with the Product, Design, and Data teams to build, test, and deploy new features across the WHY Nutrition website, Shopify storefront, and internal dashboards.
 



 You will start by owning smaller but critical modules — and quickly grow into handling full\\-stack components with mentorship from senior engineers.
 



 Expect an environment where you ship often, learn fast, and see your work go live within days, not quarters.
   




**Key Responsibilities** 

 • Design and build
 **high\\-performance, responsive interfaces** 
 using React, JavaScript, and Shopify Liquid.
 



 • Develop and integrate
 **new functional modules** 
 such as Nutrition Quiz, SmartCoin Wallet, Rewards Engine, and Food\\-Score API.
 



 • Collaborate cross\\-functionally with backend engineers (Python/Node) and designers to ensure seamless UI/UX experiences.
 



 • Continuously optimize Core Web Vitals — speed, layout, and interactivity — to ensure exceptional user experience.
 



 • Write modular, maintainable, and testable code following best practices.
 



 • Manage repositories using Git/GitHub with clear commit hygiene and PR reviews.
 



 • Participate in sprint planning, documentation, and retrospective sessions to improve product delivery cycles.
   




**Required Qualifications** 

 • 0–2 years of professional experience, or a strong portfolio demonstrating real\\-world project work.
 



 • Solid understanding of
 **HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6\\+)** 
 .
 



 • Working knowledge of React.js and component\\-based architecture.
 



 • Familiarity with REST APIs, JSON data structures, and integration workflows.
 



 • Version control fluency (Git, GitHub, branching, pull requests).
 



 • Ability to learn rapidly, adapt to new frameworks, and take initiative without constant supervision.
   




**Preferred Skills** 

 • Prior exposure to Shopify theme development and Liquid templating.
 



 • Basic experience with backend scripting (Python or Node.js).
 



 • Understanding of SEO, accessibility, and performance optimization.
 



 • Knowledge of deployment environments such as Fly.io or Render.
 


**Growth Path** 

 You’ll be part of a flat, fast\\-moving team where contribution matters more than tenure.
 



 Structured growth plan:
 



**SDE\\-1 → SDE\\-2 → Senior Engineer → Tech Lead → Head of Engineering** 




 We invest heavily in continuous learning — including sponsored online certifications, peer code reviews, and mentorship from experienced product engineers working across commerce, health\\-tech, and AI infrastructure.
 


**Compensation \\& Benefits** 

 •
 **Best\\-in\\-Industry CTC** 
 aligned with your skillset and potential.
 



 •
 **Annual performance bonus** 
 linked to product milestones and release cadence.
 



 •
 **ESOPs from Year 1** 
 for high\\-performing contributors — you grow as the company grows.
 



 • Hybrid working model (3 days office / 2 days remote) or fully remote for exceptional candidates.
 



 • Access to wellness benefits, product discounts, and learning stipends.
