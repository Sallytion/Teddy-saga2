 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

* Participate actively in agile ceremonies, delivering incremental value with measurable outcomes.
* Contribute to CI/CD pipelines, observability, and automation frameworks.
* Write clear, reusable code and documentation to support discovery and reuse across teams.
* Collaborate with senior engineers to ensure technical solutions align with long\\-term Helix architecture.


**Required Qualifications**
* Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field (or equivalent experience).
* 2–3 years of professional software development experience.
* Experience building or consuming REST APIs.
* Hands\\-on experience with Python, Java, or Node.js.
* Familiarity with event streaming platforms (Kafka preferred).
* Understanding of databases (SQL/NoSQL) and data exchange formats (JSON, XML).
* Experience with Git and basic CI/CD workflows.
* Solid understanding of how systems interact through APIs and services.
* Strong problem\\-solving and communication skills.


**Nice to Have**
* Exposure to microservices or modernization projects.

* Familiarity with cloud environments (AWS preferred) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
* Exposure to Siebel CRM or other enterprise applications.
* Some experience with front\\-end frameworks (React, Angular, or Vue).
* Interest in AI and automation — especially in how intelligent agents can optimize workflows.


**What Makes You a Great Fit**
* You’re eager to learn from senior engineers and contribute to building the future Helix architecture.
* You think about reusability, data flow, and automation when building solutions.
* You’re curious about agentic systems and how technology can enable intelligent automation.
* You take pride in writing quality code that moves systems closer to cloud\\-ready, modular design.
