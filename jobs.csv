 At Joveo, our mission is to deliver the right job to everyone in the world. We're the global leader in programmatic job advertising, building a new generation of recruitment technology. Our platform, backed by marquee investors like Nexus Venture Partners and celebrated on the Inc. 5000 list, is changing how employers find talent.
 



 Our secret sauce? We are building and deploying
 **state\\-of\\-the\\-art generative AI products, including intelligent multimodal chatbots, screening solutions and GenAI native applications that are seeing mass production adoption.** 
 To do this, we need exceptional engineers to build the robust, scalable, and resilient systems that bring AI to life.
 



  





**The Role: The Engineer Behind the AI** 




 This is an opportunity for a brilliant backend engineer to step into the world of AI. We're looking for a systems thinker with a passion for building rock\\-solid software and a deep curiosity to tackle new challenges.

 Work in a tight\\-knit team with product managers (or without, if you prefer!) and other elite engineers to build solutions that directly impact our customers and our bottom line.



  





**What We're Looking For (The Ideal Candidate):** 




 You are a builder at heart. You find joy in creating elegant, efficient, and reliable systems and are excited by the prospect of learning a new domain.
 


* **Elite Backend Engineering:** 
 3\\+ years of experience building and operating complex, scalable, and high\\-performance backend systems. You have a strong grasp of distributed systems, API design, and software architecture.
* **Strong Programming Foundation:** 
 Deep proficiency in a systems language like
 **Python** 
 or
 **Java** 
 . You write clean, maintainable, and well\\-tested code. (Experience with Python is a strong plus).
* **A Fierce Curiosity \\& Rapid Learning Ability:** 
 This is non\\-negotiable.
 **Prior professional experience with LLMs is NOT required.** 
 What is mandatory is a demonstrated passion for learning, a history of quickly mastering new technologies, and a genuine excitement to become an expert in the AI/ML space.
* **The Ownership Mindset:** 
 You are a self\\-starter who is comfortable with ambiguity and enjoys the freedom and responsibility of a startup environment. You have extensive experience working in large codebases and are skilled at navigating cross\\-functional dependencies.
* **Pragmatic and Driven:** 
 You have a strong sense of urgency and an ability to deliver high\\-quality, pragmatic solutions quickly without sacrificing long\\-term stability.



  





**Why You’ll Love This Role at Joveo:** 



* **The Perfect Launchpad into AI:** 
 This is your chance to pivot into the most exciting field in technology. Leverage your elite engineering skills as a foundation and let us provide the problems, mentorship, and environment for you to become an expert in production AI.
* **Build Things That Matter:** 
 The systems you build will be the backbone of products used by millions, directly helping people find jobs.
* **Radical Ownership:** 
 Forget bureaucracy. You will have the autonomy to make critical decisions and see your work go live in production, fast.
* **A Culture of Builders:**

* Strong data handling skills (exploration, cleaning, preprocessing).
* Ability to prototype quickly and build simple APIs to demonstrate solutions.
