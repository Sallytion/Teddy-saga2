+ Building and introducing AI tools that improve delivery efficiency and reduce repetitive work; challenging legacy solutions that slow velocity
+ Proactively leading adaptation during change: re\\-scoping tasks during direction pivots, aligning with Product, and surfacing trade\\-offs clearly to move decisions forward
+ Implementing data loops that enable continuous optimisation (quality metrics, capacity/latency/cost trade\\-offs, velocity signals, and post\\-launch monitoring)


**Who Are You**
* At first, a tech\\-savvy person who likes to work with people and teams
* Willing to learn from Senior and Staff Software Engineers
* Owner of your progress as an individual
* You bring 8\\+ years of software development experience within a modern SaaS environment
* You’re proficient in dynamically typed, OOP languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby or similar languages
* You have 5\\+ years of practical SQL experience (PostgreSQL preferred)
* You’ve worked extensively with cloud platforms (5\\+ years, AWS preferred), enabling scalable and automated infrastructure
* You have hands\\-on experience with ReactJS or similar modern front\\-end frameworks
* You’ve led end\\-to\\-end technical projects through all phases of the software development lifecycle, and are now looking to apply that experience toward building intelligent, automated, and AI\\-enhanced security products
* Must Have:
+ You have strong experience delivering AI\\-assisted features or agentic systems into production (or leading a substantial agentic initiative from prototype to reliable launch)
+ Experience with agentic architectures (tool use/function calling, workflow orchestration, retrieval/RAG, human\\-in\\-the\\-loop)
+ Experience with evaluation and data loops (golden sets, offline/online evals, experimentation, quality dashboards, regression monitoring)
+ You can clearly explain measurable trade\\-offs you’ve made (latency/cost/quality/capacity), and how you used data to drive decisions and iteration.


 You’re
 **effective in ambiguity** 
 : you partner with Product to clarify scope, surface trade\\-offs, and avoid custom service builds that slow teams later.

 Not a role where you just optimize endpoints or manage tickets. You’ll be helping architect the backend of a global, privacy\\-first communication platform— built from the ground up, on principles we don’t compromise. It’s an opportunity to craft a product that users love—and one that holds its own against WhatsApp, Teams, or Signal, not just in UX, but in security, auditability, and data control. You’ll build systems that deliver consumer\\-grade performance and military\\-grade privacy. We’re not iterating on someone else’s blueprint. We’re carving a new one.
 



  





**Who are we?** 




  





 We are a young product company scaling fast and outgrowing the startup tag—with global scale in our crosshairs. We don’t do “okay.” We give everything we’ve got to build the best communication platform in the world. Our team includes engineers from IIT and other top institutions—people who care deeply about the craft, performance, and purpose. You’ll learn more in 6 months here than most engineers do in 3 years elsewhere. We’re intense. High\\-strung. Focused. Our team includes engineers from IIT and other top\\-tier
 



 backgrounds. But what defines us is not our degrees—it’s our refusal to compromise on quality, performance, or privacy.
 



  





**What are we building?** 




  





 WrkTalk is the world's first zero\\-access, zero\\-spam enterprise communication product that operates on a structural privacy architecture. One that’s already earned the trust of large enterprises like L\\&T Finance, Adani Group, and Kalyan Jewellers – just to name a few of our enterprise clients. This is not an MVP. This is production\\-grade software that secures communication for thousands—and soon, millions—of professionals worldwide.
 



  





**What’s the role?** 




  





 • Design and build blazing\\-fast, secure APIs using NestJS and Golang
 



 • Architect robust microservices that scale and perform under pressure
 



 • Engineer real\\-time communication using WebSockets, WebRTC, and mediasoup
 



 • Optimize and tune PostgreSQL and Redis for lightning\\-fast access and reliability
 



 • Lead Dockerized deployments and manage Kubernetes clusters
 



 • Collaborate with our high\\-performance team of frontend devs, DevOps, and product leaders to ship elite\\-quality code
 



 • Build for zero\\-trust environments—because no data should ever leak
 



  





**The tech here is serious.** 




 We work on socket\\-driven comms infrastructure, distributed control towers, multi\\-category encryption, root detection, app kill\\-switches, dynamic guest access, device\\-level lockout, and OOO/ DND logic layered with smart whitelisting. This is not lightweight app dev. This is protocol\\-layer decision\\-making.
 



  





**Why should you join?** 




  





 • Because you want to own backend architecture—not just follow it
 



 • Because you’ll work directly with established founders, not buried under layers
 



 • Because you’ll ship real, deeply engineered features used by large number of enterprise users
 



 • Because you’ll grow 10x faster here—in experience, learning, and impact
 



 • And because if you walk this road with us for 3–4 years, it’ll catapult you into a tech orbit or fame and glory you never imagined
 



  





**Who should apply?** 




  





 • 3\\+ years of backend experience building high\\-performance systems
 



 • Expertise in Golang and Node.js (NestJS)
 



 • Deep knowledge of PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes
 



 • Strong command over microservices, RESTful APIs, and authentication protocols
 



 • Prior experience with real\\-time systems (WebSockets, WebRTC, mediasoup is a big plus)
 



 • Builders. Owners. With hunger to ship fast, fail fast, and optimize endlessly
