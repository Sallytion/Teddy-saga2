 The biggest challenges for the team are reliability and performance. The growth of the business is driving us to improve the ability of our systems to scale out and handle traffic patterns that are several orders of magnitude greater than what we can support today.
 



 We understand that software is living and needs investment. The challenge is making the right tradeoffs, communicating those decisions effectively, and crisp execution.
 



 We need engineers who can build services that handle millions of requests per second. We need engineers who can figure out how we can survive regional data center outages and protect our customers. We need engineers who can build services that enable us to offer even more options to customers and contribute to the overall growth of Oracle Cloud.

 Started in 2019, STAGE is an entertainment platform for regional cultures known for producing premium quality content in Indian languages to reinforce, protect and validate people’s sense of identity for their culture and heritage.
   

  

 We currently focus on Haryanvi, Rajasthani and Bhojpuri languages. Our mobile apps have 15 Mn\\+ downloads and 4 Mn\\+ paying customers globally. That makes STAGE the biggest media platform in these regions.
   

  

 In 2023, STAGE was also featured on Shark Tank India S2\\. Watch our story here .
   

  

**About Our Engineering Team**
 We are a lean team of 7 engineers who have a broad set of technical skills and expertise in a few. We are small, but we proudly ship a lot.
   

  

 We have big ambitions in how we want to serve our customers while staying a lean team by doing things the right way. We pay a lot of attention to quality in shipping features to customers and continuously push to improve our systems incrementally. We are hackers who love technology and don’t shy away from trying new things as long as they deliver value and are maintainable in the long run.
   

  

 Our tech stack consists of React.js, Flutter, Typescript (we are migrating), Next.js, Express, MongoDB, Memcached, Github Actions, AWS and Kubernetes. We are strongly biased towards buying tools rather than building them, and invest heavily in a few vs having 20 ways to solve the same problems.
   

  

**About The Opportunity**
 We are looking for an exceptional Software Engineer to join our Frontend team. This is a unique opportunity to join a fast growing company in the early STAGEs where you will get to solve real customer and business problems, shape the future of a product built for Bharat and build the engineering culture of the team. You will have immense responsibility and autonomy to push the boundaries of engineering to deliver scalable and resilient systems.
   

  

 As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be responsible for shipping innovative features at breakneck speed and designing the architecture. If you are someone who loves solving problems for customers, technology, the craft of software engineering, and the thrill of building startups, we would like to talk to you.
   

  

**What you will be doing**
* Build and ship features in our Next.js website codebase that directly impact user experience and help move the top and bottom line of the business.
* Collaborate closely with our product, design and data team to build innovative features to deliver a world class product to our customers. At STAGE, product managers don’t “tell” what to build. In fact, we all collaborate on how to solve a problem for our customers and the business. Engineering plays a big part in it.
* Design performant and scalable platforms that empower our product and marketing teams to rapidly experiment.
* Own the quality of our products by writing automated tests, reviewing code, making systems observable and resilient to failures.
* Provide technical leadership by guiding architectural decisions for speed, simplicity and reliability, driving best practices and coding standards, mentoring the team, and ensuring efficient and reliable feature delivery.
* Set the engineering culture with our CTO by defining how we should work as a team, set standards for quality (testing, performance, reliability), and improve the speed of engineering execution. The role could be ideal for you if you
+ Deep knowledge of TypeScript, JavaScript, Web APIs, CSS, internals of browsers and modern frontend toolchain (NPM, Yarn, PNPM, Webpack, Vite, etc.).
+ 4\\-8 years of experience of building web applications using modern web technologies (like React.js, Next.js, Remix, Vue.js, etc.) and a deep experience in CSS.
+ Experienced in writing automated tests (especially integration tests) using Jest, Vittest or a similar framework. At STAGE, engineers own quality and hence, writing automated tests is crucial to the role.
+ Experience in driving technical decisions such as architecture, technologies, engineering practices and setting standards to deliver high\\-quality products and meet business results.
+ Care deeply about code quality, software architecture (think about Object Oriented Programming, Clean Code, etc.), scalability and reliability.
+ Understand the importance of shipping fast in a startup environment and constantly try to find ingenious ways to achieve the same.
+ Collaborate well with everyone on the team. We communicate a lot and don’t hesitate to get quick feedback from other members on the team sooner than later.
+ Can take ownership of goals and deliver them with high accountability.
+ Don’t hesitate to try out new technologies. At STAGE, nobody is limited to a role. Every engineer in our team is an expert of at least one technology but often ventures out in adjacent technologies like Flutter, Data Platforms, AWS and Kubernetes. If you are not excited by this, you will not like working at STAGE.
- Bonus : if you have experience in adjacent technologies like backend engineering (with frameworks like Nest.js, Express.js, etc.), AWS (or any public cloud provider), Github Actions (or CircleCI), Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi, etc.), etc.","Entertainment Providers","https://in.linkedin.com/company/stagedotin","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFw41oSBgJyVw/company-logo_100_100/B56ZrOzP.OJUAU-/0/1764406133471/stagedotin_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=jkxxZyAad6IcNyBKGWe7NOLbUt8nKbdPelxIUyGtS5g","","","","","","","","","","",""
