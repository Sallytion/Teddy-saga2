Their platform enables seamless payments and smart banking features that directly impact how real people manage their finances, pay bills, and plan their futures.
 



  





 The team is built on a foundation of craftsmanship and high standards. They're not looking for engineers who just complete tickets \\- they're looking for people who care deeply about what they build, love solving hard problems, and raise the bar with every feature they ship. If building systems that truly matter and doing it exceptionally well sounds exciting, this is the right place.
 



  





**The Opportunity** 




  





 This fully remote position offers junior backend engineers the chance to work on production systems handling millions of transactions while learning from experienced engineers who genuinely care about mentorship and growth.
 



  





**Important Note:** 
 Due to the remote nature of this role, candidates must have real\\-world backend development experience and strong communication skills to collaborate effectively across distributed teams.
 



  





**What We're Looking For:** 




**Required:** 



* **1\\-2 years of backend development experience** 
 working on production systems
* Proven experience building real applications (not just tutorial projects) that users have actually used
* Strong proficiency in at least ONE modern backend language (
 **Java, Python, Go, Node.js, C\\#, or Scala** 
 \\- the specific language doesn't matter)
* Solid understanding of REST APIs, databases, and basic cloud concepts (AWS, Docker, etc.)
* **Excellent communication skills** 
 \\- ability to articulate technical problems clearly in writing and verbally
* Self\\-driven with the ability to work independently while knowing when to ask for help
* Comfortable working in a fully remote, async\\-first environment



  





**Who Thrives Here:** 




  





 This team isn't looking for average engineers who clock in and out. They're building a platform that handles people's hard\\-earned money \\- there's no room for ""good enough.""
 



  





 The ideal candidate is someone who:
 



  




* **Cares deeply about craft** 
 \\- takes pride in writing code that's not just functional, but elegant and maintainable
* **Sets their own high bar** 
 \\- doesn't need to be pushed to do quality work; quality is personal
* **Loves problem\\-solving** 
 \\- gets genuinely excited about finding better ways to build things
* **Thinks about the end user** 
 \\- remembers that every line of code impacts a real person's financial life
* **Takes ownership** 
 \\- treats the codebase like it's their own, because in many ways, it is



 If ""good enough"" isn't in your vocabulary and you genuinely care about the systems you build, this team wants to talk to you.
 



  





**Bonus Points:** 



* Previous remote work experience
* **Open source contributions** 
 or personal projects demonstrating initiative
* Experience with distributed systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, or similar)
* Startup or fast\\-paced environment experience
* Understanding of fintech or payment systems



  





 The team genuinely doesn't care which backend language candidates are experienced in. Whether it's Java, Python, Go, Node.js, or any other modern language \\- strong engineers can adapt. The focus is on problem\\-solving ability, code quality, and communication skills rather than specific syntax knowledge.
 



  





**Day\\-to\\-Day Responsibilities:** 




  




* Build and maintain APIs under senior engineer guidance
* Take ownership of features from conception to deployment
* Debug and resolve production issues independently with team support
* Participate in pair programming sessions with experienced engineers
* Write clean, maintainable, well\\-tested code
* Contribute to code reviews and learn from feedback
* Collaborate asynchronously across time zones with clear communication



  





 In a fully remote environment spanning multiple time zones, the ability to communicate effectively is critical. The ideal candidate will:
 


* Write clear, detailed messages that provide proper context
* Ask questions proactively when blocked (not after days of struggling)
* Provide thoughtful, constructive code review feedback
* Explain technical decisions and trade\\-offs clearly
* Collaborate effectively in both written and verbal formats



  





**The Interview Process:** 




 One focused day. Three conversations. Zero take\\-home assignments.
 



**Stage 1:** 
 Code Pairing Session (45 minutes)
 


* Collaborative problem\\-solving to assess technical skills and communication



**Stage 2:** 
 Technical Discussion (45 minutes)
 


* Deep dive into past projects, technical decisions, and problem\\-solving approach

 ✓
 **Fully remote work** 
 \\- operate from anywhere within the IST timezone
 



 ✓
 **Modern technology stack** 
 \\- no legacy systems or outdated codebases
 



 ✓
 **Real mentorship program** 
 \\- learn from senior engineers invested in your growth
 



 ✓
 **Competitive compensation** 
 appropriate for junior level talent
 



 ✓
 **Clear career progression** 
 \\- established path from junior to mid\\-level engineer
 



 ✓
 **Meaningful impact** 
 \\- code directly affects millions of users daily
 



 ✓
 **Collaborative team culture** 
 \\- supportive environment that values learning
 



 ✓
 **Ownership opportunities** 
 \\- real responsibility with appropriate guidance
 



  





**Company Values \\& Culture:** 




  





 The company believes diverse perspectives and backgrounds build better products. They welcome candidates from all educational and professional backgrounds who can demonstrate strong technical skills and communication abilities.
 



  





**However, there's one non\\-negotiable:** 
 a commitment to excellence. The team isn't looking for average engineers. They need people who:
 


* Care deeply about the quality of their work
* Love what they do and it shows in their code
* Set a higher bar with every feature they build
* Take pride in craftsmanship, not just completion



  





 This isn't about perfection \\- it's about giving a damn. If you're someone who loses sleep over elegant solutions and feels genuine satisfaction when your code helps millions of users, you'll fit right in.
 



  





**How to Apply:** 




 Interested candidates should submit their application with:
 


* Updated resume highlighting relevant backend experience
* Brief note explaining their interest and communication approach in remote teams
