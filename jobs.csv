**GoQuant Technologies Inc** 




  





**About Us** 




 GoQuant develops solutions that make life easier and more profitable for digital asset traders and researchers. We do so primarily by increasing transparency, boosting speed, and placing decisions in the hands of users.
 



 We currently offer two solutions: GoMarket and GoTrade. GoMarket is a subscription service that delivers low\\-latency digital asset data via WebSocket. Features include a unified querying language that allows users to easily bypass exchange\\-specific protocols to access data. GoTrade is a trade execution platform that allows clients to trade digital assets—using multiple interfaces (Rest API, UI, WebSocket, Redis, etc.) to rapidly interact and trade with cryptocurrency exchanges.
 



  





 Our applications are primarily written in C\\+\\+, Rust and Python, and core frameworks include NextJS.
 



 This is an exciting time for the GoQuant team as we onboard clients and rapidly build out our solutions to meet their needs.
 



  





**Job Description** 




 We are looking for a
 **C\\+\\+ Software Engineer** 
 with experience and a strong interest in enterprise application and platform development. In this full\\-time role, you will contribute to the development and optimization of our GoTrade solution and have the opportunity to take on increasing responsibilities as the platform grows.
 



 You will work closely with other engineers and product managers, reporting directly to the Head of Engineering. This role offers a fantastic opportunity to gain hands\\-on experience in the fast\\-paced world of fintech and cryptocurrency.
 



  





**Responsibilities** 



* Assist in the development and optimisation of the GoTrade solution, working primarily with Python/Django, C\\+\\+ and Rust.
* Collaborate with team members to support services built in other languages and cutting\\-edge technologies.
* Contribute to front\\-end and back\\-end development, including WebSocket applications, real\\-time data reporting, and data visualisation.



  





**Success Factors** 




 We are looking for passionate, motivated engineers who are eager to learn and grow within a dynamic startup environment. Here are a few attributes of a successful candidate:
 


* **Curiosity and Resourcefulness** 
 : GoQuant is a startup where natural aptitude, individual capability, and resourcefulness thrive.
* **Team Player** 
 : We believe in building strong, talented teams. As a member of the team, you will have the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from others.
* **Integrity and Growth Mindset** 
 : We value employees who defend their positions with passion but also maintain a bias toward ‘doing right’ rather than ‘being right.’



  





**Qualifications** 



* Strong experience or interest in C\\+\\+ programming and enterprise application development.
* Familiarity with front\\-end languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS.
* Experience or coursework in database systems (Postgres preferred) and real\\-time application development (WebSocket, Redis, ZMQ).
* Interest in cloud computing (AWS, Azure) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) is a plus.
* Strong learning ability and problem\\-solving skills.



  





**How to Apply** 




 If you’re interested in this full\\-time position, please apply! Even if you don’t meet all the qualification criteria, we still encourage you to apply. We are looking for passionate, eager learners who are excited about the project at hand.
