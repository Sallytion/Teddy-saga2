* Excellent communications skills including proven experience effectively communicating technical challenges and solutions to peers, customers and clients.
* Strong working knowledge of networking technologies.
* Knowledge of Agile principles and Sprint Planning, including planning/backlog tools (e.g. JIRA)
* Innovative problem\\-solving skills, with a track record of developing creative solutions to technical challenges.


**What You Will Work On**
 You will join a squad making a difference at Nike through the development of core enterprise infrastructure. You will create APIs and automation that support rapid change while insuring the correctness and stability of foundational services.
   

  

 You will participate in team/product planning sessions, share your ideas for our products and services, and help refine and prioritize our backlog. You will partner with other Core Engineers, Architecture, Product and Program mangers to seamlessly integrate our products and capabilities into our multi\\-cloud ecosystem, while helping to assess risks and navigate governance policy. You will work closely with cloud infrastructure engineers and cloud account holders to iteratively deploy product features and codified policies that will improve the operating posture of Nike in the cloud.
   

  

**Who You Will Work With**
 You will report to the Director of Core Services and join a global team that supports critical core infrastructure. Flexibility is key to these partnerships. You will partner with architects, security experts and interact with engineers in peer squads, but this role will allow you to focus on what you truly enjoy – delivering quality code and software features that make a difference.
