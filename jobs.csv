**Location:** 
 Noida
   

  

**Experience Role Type: 1\\+** 
 years
   

  

**Role Type:** 
 Full\\-Time, Onsite
   

  

**About Seventh Triangle**
 Seventh Triangle is a leading consumer tech and ecommerce consulting firm and a Shopify Plus Partner, working with some of India’s largest enterprise brands. With a 150\\+ member team across Noida and Bangalore, we specialise in technology development, UI/UX, marketing strategy, performance advertising, retention, and digital commerce transformation.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for a hands\\-on Frontend Developer who genuinely cares about UI quality, stability, and performance. This role is not for someone who wants a “React\\-only” job. We need someone who can work across React, Next.js, HTML/CSS/JS, and Shopify Liquid, and take complete ownership of their work.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Build production\\-ready, stable, and polished frontend experiences using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Identify even the smallest UI imperfections — flickers, layout shifts, slow rendering, inconsistent spacing — and fix them proactively.
* Work on site performance improvements: LCP, CLS, image optimization, caching strategies, lazy\\-loading, etc.
* Implement analytics \\& tracking using GTM, GA4, Meta Pixel, and similar tools.
* Own assigned modules completely — from understanding requirements → planning → execution → delivery — without constant supervision.
* Work across different tech stacks depending on the project: React apps, Next.js websites, Shopify Liquid themes \\& components.
* Troubleshoot UI bugs, browser inconsistencies, state flow issues, and frontend performance problems.


**Required Skills \\& Expectations**
**Core Technical Skills**
* Minimum 1 year of production experience building and releasing real websites.
* Strong base in HTML, CSS, JavaScript — candidates who only know React without fundamentals will not be considered.
* Proficient with React; experience with Next.js is a strong plus.
* Shopify Liquid experience is a major advantage (or willingness to learn quickly).
* Understanding of Core Web Vitals and practical experience improving LCP, CLS, and overall performance.
* Working knowledge of GTM, GA, and other analytics integrations.


**Quality \\+ Ownership**
* Extreme attention to detail — anything visually or interactively off must be unacceptable to you.
* Problem\\-solving mindset is non\\-negotiable — if you cannot debug issues logically, this is not the right role.
* Ability to take ownership of a project/module without hand\\-holding.
* Comfortable with any frontend task — small UI bug to enterprise\\-scale feature, React to Liquid, basic page to complex component.
* Must be open and motivated to grow into a complete frontend engineer, not restricted to a single framework.


**Good To Have**
* Knowledge of SEO\\-friendly frontend practices.
* Understanding of Web Accessibility basics.
* Familiarity with Git workflows and modern development tooling.
* Knowledge of state\\-management libraries such as Redux, MobX, or Zustand is a plus.
* Experience with AI\\-assisted coding tools (Copilot, Cursor, etc.).


**Format Requirements**
* Keep the entire submission under 300 words.
* Keep each answer 3–5 sentences.
* This writeup must be strictly written by you, not by AI tools.


**Important – Zero Tolerance Policy**
* We evaluate tone, structure, and writing patterns.
* If your note appears generic, templated, or AI\\-generated, your application will be rejected immediately without review.
* We also verify this during the interview.
* If your explanation does not match your written submission, the application is disqualified.


**Who Should Apply**
* Someone who wants to master the entire frontend ecosystem, not one library.
* Someone who focuses on quality, details, and smooth user experience.
* Someone who takes ownership, can deliver independently, and enjoys problem solving.


**Who Should NOT Apply**
* If you want a React\\-only role.
* If you are not detail\\-oriented.
* If you rely heavily on AI to write or debug everything.
* If you need constant reminders and follow\\-ups on tasks.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://in.linkedin.com/company/seventh-triangle-consulting","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQF4aKuBWVJJGw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1658490510864/seventh_triangle_consulting_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7yLfMMHgAXlN3aeofBnx3ZefesfKx-dUAFaILW92FwA","","","","","","","","","","",""

 AiPrise is building a modern compliance platform for global businesses: KYB, KYC, risk, and AI\\-assisted compliance workflows, designed to be fast, reliable, and easy to use.
   

  

 Compliance is usually slow, manual, and fragmented across vendors and spreadsheets. We are building the system teams actually want: strong data, great UX, clean APIs, and automation that drives real outcomes.
   

  

 Who this role is for
   

  

 We are looking for an extremely hungry Tech Lead who wants:
   

  

* High ownership and high impact
* The chance to build new product surfaces end\\-to\\-end
* The opportunity to level up the team by setting a high engineering bar
* A fast\\-moving environment where quality and correctness matter


 If you want a narrow role limited to planning and meetings, this will not be it. This is a hands\\-on Tech Lead role.
   

  

 What you will do
   

  

* Lead a squad and own delivery for a product area from roadmap to execution
* Drive technical design for frontend and backend systems, and make the right tradeoffs
* Stay hands\\-on by shipping critical parts of the stack yourself
* Raise engineering quality through reviews, patterns, testing, and best practices
* Mentor engineers and help them grow faster through clear feedback and guidance
* Partner with Product and Design to simplify complex compliance workflows into great UX
* Improve foundations: performance, reliability, observability, security, and cost efficiency


 What we are looking for
   

  

* 6 to 10\\+ years of experience building production software
* Strong full\\-stack fundamentals: APIs, data modeling, UI architecture, performance, debugging
* Proven ownership: you have led projects end\\-to\\-end and shipped to production
* You can balance speed with quality and make pragmatic decisions under ambiguity
* Strong communication and ability to drive alignment across engineering and product


 Nice to have
   

  

* React and TypeScript, and Python (Flask or FastAPI) or Node.js
* Strong SQL and Postgres experience
* Experience in fintech, compliance, fraud, risk, workflow systems, or B2B SaaS
* Experience building internal tools used by ops teams every day


 Why AiPrise
   

  

* High ownership from day one, with real autonomy
* Small team, high talent density, fast iteration cycles
* Direct impact on trust, fraud prevention, and onboarding speed
* Clear growth path into Staff, Engineering Manager, or domain owner roles","Financial Services","https://www.linkedin.com/company/aiprise-inc","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGRkm4lqbCNVQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1687811669380/aiprise_inc_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7-ofvhdpN6NYzfDf3KkcmPGosTxWXFqqMbbRoZ7m_bc","","","","","","","","","","",""

**We're Remote\\-First**
 In 2020, Cimpress adopted a Remote\\-First operating model and culture. We heard from our team members that having the freedom, autonomy and trust in each other to work from home and, the ability to operate when they are most productive, empowers them to be their best.

 Not a role where you just optimize endpoints or manage tickets. You’ll be helping architect the backend of a global, privacy\\-first communication platform— built from the ground up, on principles we don’t compromise. It’s an opportunity to craft a product that users love—and one that holds its own against WhatsApp, Teams, or Signal, not just in UX, but in security, auditability, and data control. You’ll build systems that deliver consumer\\-grade performance and military\\-grade privacy. We’re not iterating on someone else’s blueprint. We’re carving a new one.
 



  





**Who are we?** 




  





 We are a young product company scaling fast and outgrowing the startup tag—with global scale in our crosshairs. We don’t do “okay.” We give everything we’ve got to build the best communication platform in the world. Our team includes engineers from IIT and other top institutions—people who care deeply about the craft, performance, and purpose. You’ll learn more in 6 months here than most engineers do in 3 years elsewhere. We’re intense. High\\-strung. Focused. Our team includes engineers from IIT and other top\\-tier
 



 backgrounds. But what defines us is not our degrees—it’s our refusal to compromise on quality, performance, or privacy.
 



  





**What are we building?** 




  





 WrkTalk is the world's first zero\\-access, zero\\-spam enterprise communication product that operates on a structural privacy architecture. One that’s already earned the trust of large enterprises like L\\&T Finance, Adani Group, and Kalyan Jewellers – just to name a few of our enterprise clients. This is not an MVP. This is production\\-grade software that secures communication for thousands—and soon, millions—of professionals worldwide.
 



  





**What’s the role?** 




  





 • Design and build blazing\\-fast, secure APIs using NestJS and Golang
 



 • Architect robust microservices that scale and perform under pressure
 



 • Engineer real\\-time communication using WebSockets, WebRTC, and mediasoup
 



 • Optimize and tune PostgreSQL and Redis for lightning\\-fast access and reliability
 



 • Lead Dockerized deployments and manage Kubernetes clusters
 



 • Collaborate with our high\\-performance team of frontend devs, DevOps, and product leaders to ship elite\\-quality code
 



 • Build for zero\\-trust environments—because no data should ever leak
 



  





**The tech here is serious.** 




 We work on socket\\-driven comms infrastructure, distributed control towers, multi\\-category encryption, root detection, app kill\\-switches, dynamic guest access, device\\-level lockout, and OOO/ DND logic layered with smart whitelisting. This is not lightweight app dev. This is protocol\\-layer decision\\-making.
 



  





**Why should you join?** 




  





 • Because you want to own backend architecture—not just follow it
 



 • Because you’ll work directly with established founders, not buried under layers
 



 • Because you’ll ship real, deeply engineered features used by large number of enterprise users
 



 • Because you’ll grow 10x faster here—in experience, learning, and impact
 



 • And because if you walk this road with us for 3–4 years, it’ll catapult you into a tech orbit or fame and glory you never imagined
 



  





**Who should apply?** 




  





 • 3\\+ years of backend experience building high\\-performance systems
 



 • Expertise in Golang and Node.js (NestJS)
 



 • Deep knowledge of PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes
 



 • Strong command over microservices, RESTful APIs, and authentication protocols
 



 • Prior experience with real\\-time systems (WebSockets, WebRTC, mediasoup is a big plus)
 



 • Builders. Owners. With hunger to ship fast, fail fast, and optimize endlessly
 



  





**Where are we located?** 




 We’re based in Navi Mumbai and building for the world.","Data Security Software Products, Technology, Information and Media, and IT Services and IT Consulting","https://in.linkedin.com/company/wrktalk-io","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQHheVmzqMa86g/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1714278260972/wrktalk_io_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Jz70zOzUYtL3N4Fs1_6flgtf7zybajP0pudXeQiK8Ro","","","","","","","","","","",""
