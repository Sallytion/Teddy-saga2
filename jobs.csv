 AION is building an interoperable AI cloud platform by transforming the future of high\\-performance computing (HPC) through its decentralized AI cloud. Purpose\\-built for bare\\-metal performance, AION democratizes access to compute and provides managed services, aiming to be an end\\-to\\-end AI lifecycle platform—taking organizations from data to deployed models using its forward\\-deployed engineering approach.
   

  

 AI is transforming every business around the world, and the demand for compute is surging like never before. AION thrives to be the gateway for dynamic compute workloads by building integration bridges with diverse data centers around the world and re\\-inventing the compute stack via its state\\-of\\-the\\-art serverless technology. We stand at the crossroads where enterprises are finding it hard to balance AI adoption with security. At AION, we take enterprise security and compliance very seriously and are re\\-thinking every piece of infrastructure from hardware and network packets to API interfaces.

 Supermaya is building frontier generative systems for marketing—
 **not just generating visuals, but making generative video reliable under constraints** 
 through a “Director layer”: controllability, consistency, editability, rigorous evaluation, and learning loops that improve with data.
 


 The hard problem we’re solving
 
 Generative video looks impressive until you demand all of this
 *simultaneously* 
 :
 


* **Temporal coherence** 
 across shots (no flicker, drift, identity collapse)
* **Brand/product consistency** 
 (same object attributes, materials, logos, colors—reliably)
* **Targeted edits** 
 (change one thing without breaking the rest)
* **Planning \\& orchestration** 
 (script → storyboard → shot plan → generation)
* **Evaluation that matters** 
 (metrics \\+ preference signals that correlate with human judgment)
* **Learning loops** 
 (turn outcomes into model/system improvements)



 We’re building this with
 **training/finetuning, structured representations, evaluation harnesses, and compounding data flywheels** 
 .
 


 Role: What you’ll do
 * Drive tight research loops:
 **hypothesis → experiment → ablations → evaluation → decision**
* Improve
 **controllability \\+ consistency** 
 in multimodal/video generation under real constraints
* Design
 **evaluation frameworks** 
 (auto \\+ human preference) and a failure\\-mode taxonomy
* Build
 **datasets, training/finetuning pipelines, and learning loops** 
 that compound capability
* Convert research into
 **ship\\-ready systems** 
 (robust, repeatable, measurable)
* Contribute to
 **periodic open releases** 
 : we plan to publish select model components, tools, or evaluation artifacts on
 **Hugging Face** 
 as we hit quality bars (while keeping sensitive parts proprietary)


 Requirements (modern GenAI, builder \\+ research)
 * Proven ability to build
 **modern GenAI systems end\\-to\\-end** 
 : data → training/finetuning (PEFT/LoRA, distillation, preference learning) → evaluation → deployment\\-ready artifacts
* Hands\\-on with
 **multimodal/video modeling** 
 (diffusion/transformers; temporal conditioning; control signals like masks/poses/depth/keyframes)
* Strong experimentation discipline: ablations, scaling studies, compute/memory optimization, reproducibility, experiment tracking
* Deep comfort with
 **evaluation \\+ measurement** 
 : automated metrics \\+ human\\-in\\-loop preference signals; consistency/identity checks; constraint\\-compliance testing
* Clear technical communication: concise research memos, design docs, and evidence\\-based decisions
* Comfortable working in an environment that values
 **selective open publication** 
 (HF releases) alongside building defensible IP


 What success looks like
 * You deliver
 **capability jumps** 
 backed by clean evidence (or decisive negative results that save time)
* You create evaluation that the team uses to choose direction daily
* You help build compounding IP: datasets, metrics, pipelines, and systems
* You help ship
 **periodic public artifacts** 
 (HF releases / eval toolkits / research notes) that earn respect from the community
