* Beyond monitoring and reporting, this role will also support two\\-way IoT control — enabling features such as OTA firmware updates, remote start/stop, changing parameters of the refrigeration unit for different operational requirements.



  






 This role offers a rare opportunity to define and build the complete digital ecosystem for an industry\\-critical product, combining the best of IoT, data science, and user\\-centric application design.
 




  





**Responsibilities** 




  




* System Design: Architect and implement web and mobile applications for telematics and cold\\-chain monitoring.
* Backend Development: Build robust, scalable backend systems to manage real\\-time IoT data.
* Frontend Development: Design intuitive dashboards, reports, and visualization tools with heavy use of graphs and charts.
* Notifications \\& Alerts: Develop intelligent notification systems for users (errors, health, predictive failures)
* OTA Updates: Build secure pipelines to deliver firmware updates to controllers over the air.
* Data Engineering: Collect, clean, and structure large volumes of telematics data for analytics.
* AI/ML Integration: Enable predictive analytics models for health monitoring and error detection.



  





**Requirements** 




  




* Hands\\-on experience as a Full Stack Developer with exposure to both frontend and backend technologies.
* Strong knowledge of databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or AWS RDS) and cloud platforms (AWS preferred).
* Proficiency in frontend frameworks (React, Angular, or Vue) and building data\\-rich dashboards.
* Experience with backend frameworks (Node.js, Django, or similar).
* Familiarity with real\\-time data handling, APIs, and socket\\-based communication.
* Experience with data visualization libraries (Chart.js, D3\\.js, Recharts, etc.).
