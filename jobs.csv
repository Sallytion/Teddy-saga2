* Adopt, learn, and drive best practices in design techniques, coding, testing, documentation, monitoring, and alerting.
* Demonstrate a keen awareness of Coinbase’s platform, development practices, and various technical domains, and build upon them to efficiently deliver improvements across multiple teams.
* Add positive energy in every meeting and make your coworkers feel included in every interaction.
* Communicate across the company to both technical and non\\-technical leaders with ease.
* Deliver top\\-quality services in a tight timeframe by navigating seamlessly through uncertainties.

* 3\\+ years of experience as a software engineer and 1\\+ years building backend services using Golang and gRPC.
* A self\\-starter capable of executing complex solutions with minimal guidance while ensuring efficiency and scalability.
* Proven experience integrating at least two third\\-party applications using Golang.
* Hands\\-on experience with AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Buildkite, or similar cloud infrastructure tools.
* Working knowledge of event\\-driven architectures (Kafka, MQ, etc.) and hands\\-on experience with SQL or NoSQL databases.
* Good understanding of gRPC, GraphQL, ETL pipelines, and modern development practices.



**Nice to haves:** 



* SaaS platform experience (Salesforce, Amazon Connect, Sprinklr).
* Experience with AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, or similar tools.
* Familiarity with rate limiters, caching, metrics, logging, and debugging.

 supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on major
   

 components or small services as appropriate. At this level I display a degree
   

 of ownership for the work conducted by the team and am experienced enough to
   

 know when I need support. I am able to identify risks and raise these as
   

 appropriate. At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those
   

 around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their
   

 onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to
   

 speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone
   

 that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise
   

 sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team. I contribute to the
   

 raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce
   

 and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively
   

 provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code. I
   

 have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco
   

 architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into
   

 practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment
   

 strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing
   

 these within my team. I am comfortable working in a group context and am
   

 capable of communicating technical concepts to key stakeholders.

**About The Job**
 Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is an engineering discipline that combines software and systems engineering to build and run large\\-scale, massively distributed, fault\\-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that Google's services—both our internally critical and our externally\\-visible systems—have reliability and uptime appropriate to users' needs and a fast rate of improvement while keeping an ever\\-watchful eye on capacity and performance.
   

  

 SRE is also a mindset and a set of engineering approaches to running better production systems—we build our own creative engineering solutions to operations problems. Much of our software development focuses on optimizing existing systems, building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation. As SREs are responsible for the big picture of how our systems relate to each other, we use a breadth of tools and approaches to solve a broad spectrum of problems. Practices such as limiting time spent on operational work, blameless postmortems and proactive identification of potential outages factor into iterative improvement that is key to both product quality and interesting and dynamic day\\-to\\-day work.
   

  

 SRE's culture of diversity, intellectual curiosity, problem solving and openness is key to its success. Our organization brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame\\-free environment. We promote self\\-direction to work on meaningful projects, while we also strive to create an environment that provides the support and mentorship needed to learn and grow.
   

  

 Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google's product portfolio possible. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.

 As a Software Development Engineer 3 you are in a senior Individual Contributor engineering role at Tesco. Your proficiency with foundational computer science and software engineering concepts is taken as a given, and you will have proven significant technical depth and breadth. At this level you will be playing an active role in technical leadership, with proven impact across teams and the wider directorate. You take ownership and accountability of the development of the products in your domain. You participate in activities that build capability across the organisation: coaching and mentoring of existing colleagues, and interviewing/hiring of new colleagues. Once you have reached the SDE3 level, progression will vary significantly, and is likely to include more lateral opportunities than vertical promotion. This is also the level of core technical knowledge you must reach before considering a sideways move to the management track.
   

**You will be responsible for**
 My impact reaches beyond my immediate team, and I provide perspective and context for technology choices across my directorate. The work that I do has foundational impact across teams in my area and the directorate that I am a member of. I am a technical leader for my teams and others will regularly come to me for mentorship and support. I am comfortable both supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on key features as appropriate. I have delivered multiple projects that move the needle for the business. I have demonstrated technical breadth and depth; I am an expert in my domain.
   

  

 At this level I display a high degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team. I am accountable for the quality of every result, produced by individuals and teams. I am an advocate of best practices across my directorate. I build maturity in the way we develop, deliver and operate services. I ensure that we’re learning from the best in the industry, designing and implementing appropriate testing and deployment strategies.
   

  

 I can anticipate feature evolution of my product. I utilise this when facilitating design sessions to ensure that the system architecture evolves to support future requirements. I understand the wider Tesco architectural strategy and champion its application to the systems that I work on. At this level my job starts to become just as much about exercising technical judgment as it does about implementation.
   

  

 I am comfortable managing competing priorities and am able to bring order to ambiguous scenarios. I create optimal outcomes combining short\\-term and long\\-term goals, utilising data driven decision making techniques to take appropriate trade\\-offs. I can identify risks and proactively engage with product and programme managers. I am a strong communicator within my team and to my stakeholders.
   

  

 I am a trusted mentor, a role\\-model for more junior engineers. I am approachable and am frequently asked to mentor those around me. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across the directorate, both informally in 1:1 discussions and by arranging more formal training opportunities.
