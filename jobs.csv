**What We’re Looking For:** 



* Have 2 \\- 4 years of experience in full stack/backend/devops roles
* Have shipped real enterprise or infra products — bonus if in hybrid or on\\-prem setups
* Love cleaning up messy MVPs, refactoring systems, and writing scalable backend APIs
* Know how to write glue code across microservices and edge devices
* Be excited to work on AI for the physical world, not just cloud dashboards
* Care deeply about reliability, observability, and uptime
