 Open.cx is the unified AI customer support platform automating 70%\\+ of interactions for enterprises like MoneyGram and Mollie. Backed by Y Combinator, X by Unifonic, and Shorooq Partners, we recently raised $7M\\+ to scale our operations across MENA and globally. We are moving from a startup phase to a high\\-growth scale\\-up, and we need a financial architect to build the foundation for that growth.
   

  

**Your Mandate**
* Work horizontally across marketing, sales, solutions, and post\\-sales
* Understand how GTM work actually gets done today
* Design and ship internal tools, automations, systems, and micro\\-products that 10× the output of the GTM team
* Use AI, workflow design, and lightweight tooling to turn messy, high\\-volume information into clean, repeatable, measurable motion


 If you're successful, you'll materially influence open's growth trajectory and play a central role in how we scale our GTM function.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
 Our GTM team generates an enormous amount of raw signal — executive conversations, CPO initiatives, Gong calls, product content, ROI models, and live deal insights. Today, we only capture a fraction of that value.
   

  

 Your first major mission is to turn that raw GTM noise into a structured, compounding system that points to areas each person needs to focus on, that day, and makes marketing, sales, and solutions smarter with every interaction.
   

  

 Over Time, You'll Expand Your Scope Across
   

  

* Events and webinars
* Account\\-based motions
* Paid/owned channels
* Product marketing
* Partnerships
* Sales playbook automation
* Pipeline diagnostics and forecasting workflows


 Your focus: ensure every GTM contributor operates at their highest possible level.
   

  

 Examples Of What You'll Own
   

  

* Full lifecycle ownership of internal ""products""


 From discovery → spec → build → rollout → adoption → iteration.
   

  

 You'll talk to internal users (AEs, SDRs, AMs, Marketing), look at usage data, and continually refine.
   

  

* Building internal tools, automations, and micro\\-products


 Using No\\-code / Low\\-code / Light Code Tools (Zapier, Make, N8n, Notion, Airtable, Supabase, Retool, Webflow, Scripts, AI Agents), You Will Ship Systems That
   

  

* Convert a single webinar or CIO interview into dozens of multichannel GTM assets
* Turn Gong calls into structured insights aligned to CPO initiatives, leakage categories, or ROI drivers
* Make it trivial to spin up repeatable ABM sequences, playbooks, and executive outreach


 Auto\\-surface account intel, usage signals, and deal blockers to AEs in real time
   

  

* Build open's GTM ""intelligence layer""


**Design Systems That Ingest**
* Customer conversations
* PA/340B/Appeals workflow insights
* Content and messaging
* Campaign performance
* Pipeline and forecast signals
* Competitive notes and turn them into a searchable, reusable, action\\-driving knowledge graph for the GTM org
* Run experiments that move real numbers


**Prototype, Instrument, And Measure Experiments That Improve**
* Top\\-of\\-funnel reach
* Personalization and segmentation
* Speed to lead
* Conversion by stage
* Rep productivity Cycle time


 You'll define success and be accountable to real metrics.
   

  

**What Makes Us Excited About You**
 You're a first principles thinker who loves to build.
   

  

 You see chaos — tools, workflows, spreadsheets, disconnected signals — and your brain instantly starts drawing boxes and arrows.
   

  

 You're obsessed with new tools and frontier tech.
   

  

 You experiment with AI agents, workflows, micro\\-apps, and integrations because you're curious, not because someone asked you to.
   

  

 You're fluent in data and comfortable being scrappy.
   

  

 Pulling from Salesforce, Gong, Notion, analytics tools, spreadsheets, and content repositories doesn't intimidate you. You can shape raw data into something people actually use.
   

  

 You Care About Outcomes, Not Output.
   

  

 You want to move charts and real numbers — lead flow, conversion, cycle time, rep velocity, pipeline coverage. You're comfortable designing the metric and proving impact.
   

  

 You're a cross\\-functional glue.
   

  

 You can sit with an SDR, an AE, an Account Manager, and a CPO\\-level exec and translate their needs into tools that make them say, ""Oh wow, this changes my job.""

 Turing is one of the world’s fastest\\-growing AI companies accelerating the advancement and deployment of powerful AI systems.
 



  





**Turing helps customers in two ways:** 
 Working with the world’s leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, multilinguality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and leveraging that work to build real\\-world AI systems that solve mission\\-critical priorities for companies.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 This position is within a project with one of the foundational LLM companies. The goal is to assist these foundational LLM companies in enhancing their Large Language Models.
 



  





 One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high\\-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine\\-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.
 



  





 For example, in the case of Agent Completion (AC) data generation, your task will be to simulate high\\-quality multi\\-turn conversations between a user and a smart assistant that utilizes function\\-calling tools to accomplish user goals. You will craft these dialogues by playing both the assistant and the user, while simulating tool use where necessary to guide the assistant through complex decision\\-making and real\\-world reasoning scenarios.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day look like:** 



* Design multi\\-turn conversations that simulate real interactions between users and AI assistants using apps like calendar, email, maps, and drive.
* Emulate both the
 **user** 
 and the
 **assistant** 
 , including the assistant's tool calls (only when corrections are needed).
* Carefully select when and how the assistant uses available tools, ensuring logical flow and proper usage of function calls.
* Craft dialogues that demonstrate natural language, intelligent behavior, and contextual understanding across multiple turns.
* Generate examples that showcase the assistant’s ability to gracefully complete feasible tasks, recognize infeasible ones, and maintain engaging general chat when tools aren’t required.
* Ensure all conversations adhere to defined formatting and quality guidelines, using an internal playbook.
* Iterate on conversation examples based on feedback to continuously improve realism, clarity, and value for training purposes.
* Collaborate with peers and reviewers to maintain consistency and high standards in deliverables.



  





**Requirements:** 



* Strong general
 **technical reasoning skills** 
 and the ability to model real\\-world assistant behavior using tool\\-based APIs.
* Ability to break down complex tasks and simulate realistic dialogues that reflect user expectations and assistant limitations.
* Experience in
 **any programming language or tech stack** 
 is acceptable; a strong grasp of APIs, data formats (e.g., JSON), and logical thinking is more critical than specific toolsets.
* Excellent written communication skills in English, with a focus on clarity, tone, and instructional coherence.
* Creativity and attention to detail in crafting realistic scenarios and responses.
* Experience working with or around LLMs, virtual assistants, or function\\-calling frameworks is a plus.
* Ability to follow detailed guidelines and formatting standards with high consistency.
* 3\\+ years of overall professional experience in a technical or analytical field.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing:** 



* Work in a fully remote environment.
* Opportunity to work on cutting\\-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.



  





**Offer Details:** 



* **Commitments Required**
