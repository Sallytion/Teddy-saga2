 A day in the life
   

  

 As a software engineer on the Prime Video team, my day starts with diving into hands\\-on coding and technical problem\\-solving. I’m not just writing code—I’m helping to shape the architecture of complex systems that millions of people rely on every day. One of the most rewarding aspects of my role is seeing my work come to life when friends and family use Prime Video to watch their favorite shows and live sports.
   

  

 My primary focus is on designing and maintaining the APIs that power every title on Prime Video. This involves creating highly reliable and low\\-latency systems that ensure users can start streaming their content with just a click. The challenges are unique, especially when it comes to managing the sheer scale of requests we handle daily. To tackle these, I leverage AWS technologies like EC2, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, and CloudFront.
   

  

 Collaboration is a significant aspect of my role. I collaborate with a cross\\-functional team to align our technical strategies and define our long\\-term roadmap. It’s exhilarating to influence decisions that will shape the future of Prime Video. Throughout the day, I alternate between deep focus on coding and brainstorming sessions with my teammates to tackle novel challenges.
   

  

 Beyond the technical work, I also play a key role in mentoring junior engineers. Sharing my knowledge and seeing others grow is incredibly fulfilling. I’m always encouraged to push the boundaries of what’s possible, and I have the freedom to explore new ideas that can elevate our service to the next level.
   

  

 At the end of the day, I know that the work I do directly contributes to a world\\-class viewing experience for millions of Prime Video users, and that’s a great feeling.
