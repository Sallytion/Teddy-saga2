**What You'll Do: Shape the Way the World Understands Data**
 At Teradata, we're not just managing data; we're unleashing its full potential. Our ClearScape Analytics™ platform and pioneering Enterprise Vector Store are empowering the world's largest enterprises to derive unprecedented value from their most complex data. We're rapidly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Artificial Intelligence, especially in the exciting realm of
 **autonomous and agentic systems**
 We’re building intelligent systems that go far beyond automation — they observe, reason, adapt, and drive complex decision\\-making across large\\-scale enterprise environments. As a member of our AI engineering team, you’ll play a critical role in designing and deploying advanced AI agents that integrate deeply with business operations, turning data into insight, action, and measurable outcomes.

* Experience with agent memory, planning loops, self\\-reflection, and execution chains.
* Proven ability to build systems that solve for access control, identity management, and policy enforcement in the context of AI agents.
* Proficiency with cloud\\-native platforms, distributed systems, and infrastructure design for scalability and security.
* Experience building SDKs or APIs that expose agentic capabilities to developers or downstream applications.
* Excellent collaboration and communication skills across technical and non\\-technical teams.
* Proven ability to lead projects across large, distributed teams.
* Strong knowledge of LLMs, RL, or cognitive architectures is highly desirable.
* Experience with vector DBs, graph\\-based memory systems, or agentic frameworks.
