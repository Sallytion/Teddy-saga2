 At Avoca AI, we’re building the next\\-gen platform that powers home\\-service companies with autonomous voice and text agents. Our Agent Operating System lets brands configure, deploy, supervise, and measure AI agents at scale—so they can handle booking calls, member interactions, dispatch logic, and real\\-time upsell/membership workflows.
 



  




**Role Overview** 

  





 We’re looking for a
 **Software Engineer (Agent\\-OS)** 
 who thrives in the intersection of AI, tooling, product, and UX. You’ll help define and build the internal and external platform that drives thousands of real\\-world customer\\-service agents. You’ll work on prompt engineering, agent lifecycle management, data visualization, UI/UX, integrations, and production\\-grade AI systems.
 



  





 This role goes beyond “just build a UI” or “just call an LLM”—you’ll architect the systems, monitor agent performance, integrate with backend services, and ensure reliability at scale.
 



  




**What You’ll Do** 

  




* Design, build, and maintain the
 **Agent Operating System** 
 for Avoca’s agent\\-platform: tooling, deployments, monitoring, configuration.
* Develop and iterate on prompt\\-engineering pipelines, agent orchestration logic, fallback flows, and multi\\-step workflows.
* Build real\\-time dashboards and visualizations that expose agent health, call analytics, booking outcomes, error rates, and usage trends.
* Create UI/UX experiences for
 **customers** 
 (brands) to configure, deploy, and oversee their agents.
* Integrate agents with backend systems — e.g., CRMs, booking engines, dispatch systems, voice/text APIs — enabling full automation, not just conversation.
* Ensure agents run reliably in production: scale to many conversations/hour, supervise correctness, build safety/fallback layers.
* Work cross\\-functionally with AI\\-engineers, product managers, ops, and customer\\-success teams to translate business workflows into agent behaviour.
* Influence the product roadmap: propose features, help define metrics for agent success, drive continuous improvement.



  




**What You Bring** 

  





**Required** 




  




* Strong software engineering experience (backend \\+ frontend), ideally 3\\+ years.
* Comfortable building web apps (React/TypeScript or similar) and backend services (Node, Go, Python, etc.).
* Experience designing intuitive UI/UX for non\\-technical users.
* Experience working with data: dashboards, analytics, logs, monitoring.
* Able to own an end\\-to\\-end domain: architecture, development, deployment, monitoring.



  





**Preferred / Nice to Have** 




  




* Experience working with LLMs, prompt engineering, agent workflows. (At Sierra they call this “agent architecture, vector DBs, tool\\-calling”.)
* Experience integrating with APIs and backend systems of record (CRMs, booking/distribution systems) in production.
* Experience implementing monitoring, error detection, fallback logic, supervision layers for AI systems (like Sierra’s “agent supervision” concept).
* Startup experience and comfort working in ambiguous environments.
* Familiarity with modern deploy tooling: cloud, containers, observability, dashboards, metrics.
* Passion for voice/text agents, conversational UI, AI in customer\\-service contexts.



  




**Why You’ll Love This** 

  




* High impact: the agents you build will be used by hundreds of brands and thousands of end\\-customers.
* Ownership: you will own a major product surface (Agent OS) end\\-to\\-end.
* Fast growth: early\\-stage team, plenty of opportunity to define how we scale.
* Cutting\\-edge tech: prompting, orchestration, AI agents in production—this isn’t “small feature” work.
* Autonomy \\& collaboration: we expect engineers to be hands\\-on, work closely with domain experts, and help set strategy.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/avoca-ai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGZd4fJ2Chjhw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1727726363349/avoca_ai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=8v1e0gYPCi_aEdkGXuCvPzgaEIh1b2sHZ0iqzyP3XC4","","","","","","","","","","",""
