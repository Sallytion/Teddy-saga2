 For very complex, or compound requirements, that are critical to a successful delivery, convert the Customers Requirements into clear requirements language that can be more accurately assessed.
   

  

* Solution development for critical clauses.


 For requirements that are considered to be complex or critical, ensure that the method in which the requirement will be satisfied is recorded in the RMS tool.
   

  

* Expediting and reporting:


 Keep the Requirements Management / Clause by Clause process running smoothly by resolving any blockers, and providing regular progress reports on each tender.
   

  

* Change Management:


 Ensure that the team use the RMS tool to document the evolution of the requirements during the tender process. This should include any clarifications provided by the Customer, as a result of a TQ or otherwise, and any adjustments agreed with the Customer either pre or during the contract negotiations.
   

  

* Baseline for project handover.


 After award of contract, and prior to handover to the OTR Execution Team, ensure that the RMS tool is an accurate reflection of the as\\-sold position, and provides a clear baseline for the delivery of the project.
   

  

**At The (OTR) Project Execution Phase**
* General:


 Act as the focal point for Requirements Management at the OTR execution stage, by providing the Project teams with expert support and advice on both the requirements management process and the requirements management tool being used. This will include actively working within the database to ensure that the mapping and validation of requirements is done accurately and efficiently.
   

  

* Allocation to system break\\-down structure:


 Work closely with OTR Execution team, and the resources in the GEC, to map the requirements to the System Break Down Structure that will be used to deliver the project. Ensure that no requirements are left unmapped, and every system has a clearly defined owner.
   

  

* Development into requirements language:


 For very complex, or compound requirements, that are critical to a successful delivery, convert the Customers Requirements into clear requirements language that can be more accurately managed
   

  

* Business and Legal Requirements:


 Supplement the Customer requirements with the business and legal requirements that the Project teams must comply with in order to successfully deliver the project.
   

  

* Development of actions to satisfy the requirements:


 Support the OTR Execution Team to define the actions needed to satisfy the requirements. This could be simply linking the requirement to a design deliverable such as a drawing or calculation, or potentially the creation of a narrative describing the actions to be taken.
   

  

* Validation and Verification in Design:


 Ensure that the requirements are validated and verified (V\\&V) at the design stage, and the V\\&V results are recorded in the RMS tool. This shall be achieved by making the requirements specific to the system, equipment or component available during the relevant review process. (Design review etc)
   

  

* Validation and Verification in Manufacture:


 Ensure that the requirements are validated and verified (V\\&V) at the manufacturing stage, and the V\\&V results are recorded in the RMS tool. This shall be achieved by making the requirements specific to the system, equipment or component available during the relevant review process. (Factory acceptance testing etc)
   

  

* Verification at System level:


 Ensure that the requirements are validated and verified (V\\&V) at the manufacturing stage, and the V\\&V results are recorded in the RMS tool. This shall be achieved by making the requirements specific to the system, equipment or component available during the relevant review process. (Site acceptance testing etc)
   

  

* Lessons Learned:


 Capitalise significant lessons which could reoccur on projects, by converting them into requirements that must be satisfied on future projects. Maintain a library of these requirements by project type, such that they can easily be added to new projects and tenders at their commencement.
   

  

**Requirements**
 To succeed in this role, you will have the following qualification and experience:
   

  

* A first degree in Systems Engineering or any equivalent Engineering of Science Degree. (Or equivalent experience)
* Significant (min 5\\+) experience in Systems Engineering including:
