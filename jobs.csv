**JSON** 

 , and data binding
* Experience working directly from
 
**system designs** 

 ,
 
**API contracts** 

 , or
 
**flow specs**
* Strong UI/UX focus — able to build without relying on pixel\\-perfect mockups
* Comfortable with
 
**Bulma** 

 ,
 
**Bootstrap** 

 , or CSS utility frameworks
