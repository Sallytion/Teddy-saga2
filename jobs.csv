 Every business talks about “better customer conversations.” SaaS Labs builds products that actually make them happen. From JustCall to CallPage to ServiceAgent.ai, we help thousands of businesses communicate better.
 



 Here's where we are: With 300\\+ people across India, the US, and beyond, we’re at an inflection point as AI reshapes business communication.
 



 What's it like to work here? Total ownership. We’re a team that moves with purpose, builds with ambition, and loves seeing our work make a real impact.
 



 And, if you're already nodding along, let's start the conversation.
 



  





**What is ServiceAgent?** 




 For service\\-based businesses that struggle with handling calls, scheduling, billing, and customer communication,
 **ServiceAgent** 
 is an AI Operations Platform that replaces multiple front office, back office roles and tools with AI Agents, so that businesses can run 24/7 operations, capture more revenue, cut labor cost, and eliminate software clutter.
 



 Unlike AI receptionist apps, virtual assistants, or disconnected SaaS tools,ServiceAgent combines AI calling, CRM, payments, invoicing, scheduling, and follow\\-ups inside one platform \\- free to use, paid only when it performs.
 



  





**About the Role** 




 We are looking for a high\\-impact early
 **Sales Engineer** 
 to own the entire sales cycle (from demo till conversion) and contribute to bringing new businesses onboard, while leveraging data to enable leaders to scale the product

* Own the full sales cycle from lead to close for businesses.
* Strong product knowledge with hands\\-on experience in workflow automations (Zapier/n8n), APIs, IPaaS, and technical solutioning to guide prospects through demos, trials, and integrations.
* Deliver tailored product demos and proofs\\-of\\-concept (POCs) aligned to each prospect's workflow and technical setup.
* Drive trial success end\\-to\\-end, ensuring customers achieve early value and move confidently toward proposal and purchase.
* Build and maintain MSP / Project Progress Tracker documents with clear milestones, defined use cases, and success criteria for key opportunities.
* Enable data\\-driven selling by leveraging PQL scores and product usage insights to nudge customers toward next steps.



  





**What’ll Make You a Great Match** 



* **Ability to Chase \\& Close** 
 \\- a proven track record of taking cold or warm leads and converting them into paid users/customers.
* **Elite Verbal Communication \\& High EQ** 
 \\- show the ability to articulate, have the knack of reading the room instantly and carry high energy.
* **High Agency and Go Getter Attitude** 
 \\- no hiding. Treat the onboarding funnel and sales pipeline as your own. Look to solve problems on your feet without losing sight of execution.
* **1\\-4 years of experience in sales / pre\\-sales / solution engineering** 
 . 0\\-1 or 1\\-10 or founder’s office experience will be a major plus.
* You love working in the
 **US markets** 
 .



  





**Because Life’s Too Short For Boring Jobs** 



* Take time off when you need it. We trust you to manage your energy and schedule responsibly.
* We don’t track hours, just impact. Work when you’re most productive, as long as you show up for your team.
* Competitive pay that reflects your skills, experience, and the value you bring.
* Once a year, we also trade Zoom calls for real hugs and high\\-fives, gathering somewhere nice and sunny to connect, recharge, and celebrate.
* Comprehensive physical and mental health coverage for you, your partner, and your family, because care shouldn’t come with fine print.
