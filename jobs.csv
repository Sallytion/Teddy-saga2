**This internship is for someone who already knows—deep down—that:** 



* The
 **internet runs on advertising**
* **Advertising is the main chase of the network**
* **And when built well, advertising technology is one of the most lucrative, stable, and intellectually demanding areas** 
 in software



  





**If you love technology, the internet, systems, and tinkering—and you want to understand how real platforms are built, monetized, and scaled** 
 —this internship is designed to
 **change your trajectory** 
 .
 



  





**Who This Internship Is For** 




  





**You should apply if you:** 



* Are driven by
 **curiosity** 
 , not certificates
* Love
 **tinkering with code, systems, and tools**
* **Are fascinated by how the internet actually works under the hood**
* **Understand that ads, monetization, and attention power the web**
* **Want to work inside a real, bootstrapped product environment** 
 , not a sandbox
* Are willing to show up, learn fast, and take responsibility



  





**This is not a resume\\-padding internship.**

* In a
 **bootstrapped environment** 
 where:
* Resources are limited
* Learning is accelerated
* Ownership is expected
* With real accountability, not mock assignments



  





**You will not be “given tasks to stay busy.”** 




**You will be given work that matters** 
 —with guidance, but real expectations.
 



  





**What We Expect From You** 



* A genuine
 **love for technology and the internet**
* **Evidence that you’ve:**
* **Built things**
* Broken things
* Tried to understand how systems work
* Willingness to:
* Learn fast
* Ask good questions

**Experience matters less than intent, effort, and curiosity** 
 .
 



  





**Growth \\& Conversion Potential** 




  





**This internship is designed to convert** 
 .
 



 High\\-performing interns will:
 


* Gain
 **deep domain knowledge** 
 in ad\\-tech and streaming systems
* Be evaluated for:
* Full\\-time developer roles
* Expanded responsibilities as products scale
* Build a foundation for a
 **long\\-term career in a high\\-growth, low\\-attrition industry**



  





**This is not about short\\-term success.** 




**It’s about career compounding** 
 .
 



  





**Why This Internship Matters** 



* You’ll learn from a team with
 **over a decade of experience** 
 in advertising and services
* You’ll work on
 **real products** 
 , not hypothetical projects
* You’ll gain exposure to one of the
 **most durable and profitable software domains**
* **You’ll understand how technology, media, and money intersect**



  





**Very few internships give you this level of context, depth, and responsibility** 
 .
 



  





**Final Thought** 




  





**If you are looking for:** 



* A casual internship
* A checklist program
* A safe, predictable experience



 This is not it.
 



  





 If you want to:
 


* Tinker deeply
* Learn how the internet truly works
* Build systems that matter
* And step into one of the most promising tech careers early



 Then this internship could be the
 **most important few months of your early career** 
 .
 



  





**Come prepared to learn. Come prepared to work. Come prepared to grow.**

 You will act as the 
 **voice of the user inside the product team** 
 , testing features the way customers actually use them, identifying UX gaps, confusing flows, visual inconsistencies, and edge cases before anything goes live.
 



 This role is ideal for someone early in their career who:
 


* Thinks like a product manager
* Notices UI details others miss
* Gets frustrated by bad UX and broken flows

 What You’ll Do
 


1. Validate Product from a User’s Perspective (UAT):
2. Test new features end\\-to\\-end across web and mobile as a real user would.

18. Complement backend and test\\-case coverage by validating product behavior from a user and design perspective.
19. Help prioritize issues based on user impact and experience quality, not just technical severity.
20. Explore automated testing and lightweight processes to help scale testing and feature releases, working with engineering and technical teams where needed.



 What We’re Looking For
 


1. Must\\-Haves
2. 1\\-2 years of experience in product teams, in any early\\-career product role.
3. Strong instinct for user journeys, usability, and frontend behavior across web and mobile.
4. Ability to think in flows, not just features, understanding how users move end\\-to\\-end through a product.
5. High attention to detail in UI, copy, interactions, and edge cases.
6. Comfortable working with tools like JIRA, Slack, and basic browser developer tools.
7. Curious, proactive, and eager to learn how great products are built and shipped.
8. Nice\\-to\\-Have (Not Required)
9. Any exposure to UAT, usability testing, UX audits, or product validation (formal experience not mandatory).
10. Understanding of analytics, event tracking, or funnel behavior.
11. Prior experience in e\\-commerce, travel, or consumer internet products.



 Why Join Us
 


1. Work directly with Product, Design, and Engineering on a fast\\-moving AI\\-driven platform.
2. Build strong product instincts early in your career.
3. Be part of a high\\-growth startup with real customers, real scale, and no bureaucracy.
