**About The Team**
 The Platform Insights team sits within GitLab’s Monitor stage and focuses on building a unified data event platform that lets users query, visualize, and analyze data across all stages of the DevSecOps lifecycle. We are a small, cross\\-functional group of Backend Engineers and Data Engineers distributed across multiple regions, working asynchronously and documenting decisions transparently so collaboration stays smooth across time zones. We own the backend services and data pipelines that power dashboards, health metrics, and insights experiences inside GitLab, with a goal of giving users a consistent “single pane of glass” to understand their teams, processes, and services. Current challenges and opportunities include scaling high\\-volume event ingestion, improving performance for complex analytical queries, and creating reusable monitoring and insights capabilities that other GitLab product teams can adopt.
