 You are the
 **Chief Architect of the Robot’s Brain** 
 . You are not just writing a module; you are engineering the
 **Complete Production Application** 
 that runs on the robot. You define how the system boots, how it manages state, and how it integrates the
 **Robotics Team's ROS\\-based logic** 
 into your high\\-performance C\\+\\+ Core without sacrificing speed or safety.
   

  

**What You Will Engineer (The Complete System)**
* The ""Drishti\\-OS"" Application Framework (Core Architecture)
* The Challenge: This is a mission\\-critical, real\\-time application running in an explosive zone.
* Your Job: You design the Main Application Lifecycle.
* State Machine: You define the strict logic for the robot's states (e.g., Booting $ ightarrow$ Self\\-Check $ ightarrow$ Ready $ ightarrow$ Scanning $ ightarrow$ Emergency Stop).
* The ROS Bridge: The Robotics Team uses ROS Middleware for navigation. You architect the efficient Inter\\-Process Communication (IPC) bridge that allows their ROS nodes to talk to your Real\\-Time C\\+\\+ Core without introducing latency into the critical data path.
* Resource Management: You ensure the CPU/RAM are allocated efficiently so the ""Data Pump"" never starves, even while ROS is calculating trajectory.
* The ""Data Engine"" (Ingestion, Sync \\& Calculation)
* The Challenge: High\\-velocity data (730 mm/s) meets precise location tracking.
* Your Job: You build the central engine that:
* Ingests: 128 channels of Ultrasonic data via the AFM API.
* Syncs: Merges this data instantly with the ROS\\-published coordinates (X, Y, Theta) from the Robotics Team.
* Processes: Runs the C\\+\\+ ""Stitching Algorithm"" to map raw signals into a coherent buffer for the UI.
* Production\\-Grade Safety \\& Watchdogs (The ""Safety Net"")
* The Challenge: We operate in explosive refineries (Zone 1\\).
* Your Job: You implement the Software Safety Watchdogs required for ATEX certification.
* System Health: Your code monitors the heartbeat of the ROS nodes. If the Robotics logic freezes, your architecture must trigger a safe emergency stop immediately.
* Hardware Safety: You monitor internal pressure and motor temperatures, overriding control loops if physical limits are breached.
* Data Persistence (The Digital Twin Source)
* Your Job: You own the .DRISHTI binary file format. You ensure that what we write to the disk is a corrupt\\-free, memory\\-mapped exact replica of the inspection, ready for the Full Stack Team to ingest.
* The ""Immortal"" Deployment Architecture
* Your Job: You define how the code gets to the robot. You architect the OTA (Over\\-The\\-Air) System with Atomic Rollbacks. If a new update fails to boot, your architecture ensures the robot automatically reverts to the previous working version.


**Who You Will Interact With**
 You sit at the center of the engineering circle:
   

  

* Robotics Engineers (ROS Team):
* They do: They use ROS (Robot Operating System) middleware to build the robot's kinematics, navigation, and control logic.
* You do: You provide the architectural framework they plug into. You ensure their ROS messages (Pose/Odom) are consumed efficiently by your Core System.
* UI/UX Developer (Qt/QML):
* They do: They build the visual dashboard.
* You do: You provide the Backend API and Signals to drive their interface.
* Full Stack Developers (Cloud):
* They do: They build the customer\\-facing Reporting Platform.
* You do: You define the .DRISHTI File Contract so they can perfectly parse the data you save.


**The Tech Stack You Architect**
* Core: Modern C\\+\\+ (17/20\\) (Smart Pointers, Move Semantics).
* Integration: ROS / ROS2 (Subscribers, Publishers, Custom Messages).
* Framework: Qt 6 Core (Event Loop, State Machine Framework).
* OS Level: Linux System Programming (Systemd, Kernel Tuning, Watchdogs).
* Architecture: Multi\\-threaded Producer\\-Consumer, Lock\\-Free Buffers, Shared Memory.
