* Comfortable working with reactive architectures
* Ability to design clear abstractions, write maintainable and idiomatic code, and consistently improve the codebase
* Familiarity with other cross\\-platform technologies (React Native) or exposure to web/backend systems (Node/NestJS, Go, etc.) is a strong plus
