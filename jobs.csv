**About The Team**
 Document Persistent Storage Service provides secure, resilient, and highly scalable persistence with simple, easy\\-to\\-use APIs. We build, expand and extend outstanding database, key\\-value and object storage applications to store and orchestrate documents in a SaaS cloud environment. Our team's ownership is focused primarily on private data centers services but with an eye on growing the public cloud ownership also.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Join our dynamic team as a DevOps Engineer and play a crucial role in building and operating resilient and scalable infrastructure using ground breaking technologies like Chef, Ansible and Public cloud. This is a great opportunity to chip into critical applications where high availability and scalability are paramount. If you are passionate about testing, distributed database systems, concurrency, distributed storage, availability and system design, we encourage you to apply.
   

  

**About You**
 You possess a expertise in deploying and operating databases or distributed systems, ideally using tools such as Chef or Ansible. You like to mentor junior developers in team and a strong team player.
   

  

**What You'll Do:**
* Build and maintain highly available and scalable infrastructure to support critical applications.
* Contribute to the development and operation of restful services, service oriented architectures, distributed systems, cloud systems, and microservices on Linux operating systems or equivalent.
* Apply your experience with configuration management tools (Chef, Ansible, or Puppet), containerisation (Docker) to deploy and manage applications.
* Collaborate effectively within a team to achieve common goals, demonstrating strong communication skills and attention to detail.
* Participate in the design, maintenance, and improvement of highly available and fault\\-tolerant distributed software systems.
* Contribute to and promote a strong testing culture, including unit, system, and integration testing, feature toggles, canary deployments, and gradual rollouts.
* Engage with logging, monitoring, metrics, and statistics technologies to ensure system health and performance.
* Participate in an on\\-call rotation to provide support and triage for production services after a training period.


**Basic Qualifications:**
* Bachelor's degree or higher in a computer\\-related field.
* Proficient to Linux operating systems and concepts, including memory and storage management, threading and concurrency, networking and sockets, and process management.
* Expert in at least one scripting language such as Python, Ruby or Bash.


**Other Qualifications (Desirable):**
* Strong collaboration skills and the ability to work effectively with teammates.
* Expert in areas related to performance and scale, security, availability, deployment, and operations.
* A strong understanding of testing methodologies and quality assurance practices.

**Our Approach to Flexible Work**
 With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in\\-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in\\-office each week, we simply
 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
   

  

**Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!**
 At Workday, we value our candidates’ privacy and data security. Workday will never ask candidates to apply to jobs through websites that are not Workday Careers.
   

  

 Please be aware of sites that may ask for you to input your data in connection with a job posting that appears to be from Workday but is not.
   

  

 In addition, Workday will never ask candidates to pay a recruiting fee, or pay for consulting or coaching services, in order to apply for a job at Workday.

**About Sitetracker**
 Sitetracker was founded ten years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
   

  

 However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full\\-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.
   

  

 We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the \\#2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people\\-first culture.","Software Development and IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/sitetracker","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQGc32DDsZv3tg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1654642587392/sitetracker_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0P62jdqhEGTY_DksZCElhWHK7TuGhfT8SsXfDbKm6Qo","","","","","","","","","","",""
