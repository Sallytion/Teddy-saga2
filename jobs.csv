"li-4330241208","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4330241208","","C++/Qt Backend Engineer (High-Performance Systems)","Octobotics Tech","Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India","","fulltime","","","","","",False,"mid-senior level","Engineering and Information Technology","","","**1\\. The Mission (Pure Backend Focus)** 

 To architect the high\\-performance
 **C\\+\\+ Backend** 
 of our robotics software.
 **You will NOT be designing UI pixels or writing QML front\\-end code.** 
 Your mission is to build the invisible engine that processes
 **50 Mbps of raw scientific data** 
 and feeds it efficiently to the UI layer. You own the threads, the data structures, and the logic—not the buttons.
 


**2\\. Critical Outcomes (First 4 Months)** 
* **Architect the Data Ingestion Layer:** 
 Design a C\\+\\+ backend capable of ingesting
 **50 Mbps of live sensor data** 
 without dropping packets or consuming excessive CPU.
* **Decouple Backend from UI:** 
 Implement
 **Ring Buffers** 
 and
 **Lock\\-Free Queues** 
 to separate high\\-speed data acquisition threads from the main Qt Event Loop. The backend must never freeze the UI.
* **Crash\\-Proof Concurrency:** 
 Refactor the threading model. Ensure
 **Race Conditions** 
 and
 **Deadlocks** 
 are eliminated using proper synchronization (Mutexes/Semaphores) or lock\\-free designs.
* **Efficient IPC Implementation:** 
 Establish robust Inter\\-Process Communication (Shared Memory/Sockets) to allow the C\\+\\+ backend to exchange data with other Linux processes instantly.


**3\\. Competencies (Must\\-Haves)** 
* **Qt Core (Backend Only):** 
 You are an expert in QObject, QThread, QEventLoop, and the Signal/Slot mechanism. You understand how to push data
 *to* 
 QML, but you don't spend your day styling it.
* **High\\-Performance C\\+\\+:** 
 You handle data at the byte level. You prefer
 **Circular Buffers (Ring Buffers)** 
 over standard vectors for streams. You know when to use
 **Lock\\-Free** 
 programming to avoid thread contention.
* **Design Patterns:** 
 You structure complex logic using the
 **Producer\\-Consumer** 
 pattern (for data streams),
 **Singleton** 
 (for hardware managers), and
 **Factory** 
 patterns. You don't just write scripts; you architect systems.
* **Multi\\-threading Mastery:** 
 You can manage complex interaction between Data Acquisition threads, Processing threads, and the Main GUI thread without creating bottlenecks.
* **Linux System Programming:** 
 You are comfortable with
 **IPC** 
 (Shared Memory, Unix Domain Sockets) and optimizing process priorities on Linux.


**4\\. The ""Squad"" (Your Team)** 
* **UI/Frontend Developers:** 
 They handle the QML, animations, and UX;
 **you give them the data APIs** 
 they need to display.
* **Robotics (ROS) Engineers:** 
 They handle navigation (SLAM) , Locomotion and Kinematics; you ensure their data flows through the system efficiently.
* **Testers:** 
 They stress\\-test the backend; you ensure your code stands up to the 50 Mbps load.
* Em


**5\\. Why This Role Defines Your Career** 
* **Deep Backend Engineering:** 
 Escape the ""button styling"" trap. This role is 100% logic, memory management, and architectural design.
* **Hardware\\-Level Performance:** 
 You are solving real engineering problems—race conditions, memory leaks, and high\\-velocity data streams—not just calling APIs.
* **Architectural Autonomy:** 
 You decide how the data moves. You choose the patterns. You own the ""Engine Room"" of the robot.","Robotics Engineering","https://in.linkedin.com/company/octobotics-tech","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEWZAdneKtnlg/company-logo_100_100/B56Zf.hAvrGUAQ-/0/1752321756661/octobotics_tech_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=T9SuYNPFIUp7Go2-XWxy19FWC6VcSIzgVPEUOnzz3FU","","","","","","","","","","",""
