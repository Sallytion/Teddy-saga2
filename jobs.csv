Large‑scale language models are evolving from clever chatbots into powerful engines of enterprise modernization. With high‑quality training data, tomorrow’s AI can democratize legacy‑systems expertise, keep pace with core‑banking and insurance transformation, and streamline mainframe workflows for teams everywhere. That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI.
   

  

 We’re looking for COBOL specialists who live and breathe IBM z/OS mainframe development, batch and online processing, CICS transaction systems, JCL orchestration, DB2/IMS data access, VSAM file design, TSO/ISPF tooling, and Micro Focus COBOL. You’ll challenge advanced language models on topics like copybook architecture and record layouts, EBCDIC/ASCII conversion, program/performance tuning, error triage for ABENDs (S0C7/S0C4\\), transaction integrity and commit/rollback, parallel batch strategies and scheduling (CA7/Control‑M), message‑queue integration (IBM MQ), API/REST/SOAP interop from COBOL, and code review/refactoring patterns—documenting every failure mode so we can harden model reasoning.
   

  

 On a typical day, you will converse with the model on real‑world mainframe scenarios and theoretical software‑engineering questions, verify factual accuracy and logical soundness, capture reproducible error traces (SQLCODEs, dump analysis, Abend‑AID/Fault Analyzer output), and suggest improvements to our prompt engineering and evaluation metrics.
   

  

 A bachelor’s or master’s in computer science, information systems, or a closely related field is ideal; production COBOL/CICS/DB2 delivery, legacy application modernization, or hands‑on mainframe DevOps (Endevor/ChangeMan, RACF awareness, Git for z/OS, REXX scripting) signal fit. Clear, metacognitive communication—“showing your work”—is essential.
   

  

 Ready to turn your COBOL expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world.
   

  

 We offer a pay range of $6\\-to\\- $65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above. As a contractor you’ll supply a secure computer and high‑speed internet; company‑sponsored benefits such as health insurance and PTO do not apply.
