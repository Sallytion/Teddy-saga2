**More about us:\\-**
**Process Automation**
 At the heart of this seeming ‘magic’ in the background is process automation – orchestrating production and enabling safe and efficient operations of some of the most complex and vast infrastructures on our planet. For nearly 50 years, automated measurement and control of plants and processes have been central to empowering the industries that provide the basic building blocks of our everyday lives – power, water, metals, minerals, chemicals, transportation – to reliably meet our needs.
   

  

**Digital And Genix™**
 Industrial AI and analytics combined with Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) brings together artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning models, and advanced analytics tools to extract actionable insights from massive amounts of industrial data in order to optimize production and manufacturing processes. Industrial AI and analytics applied on industrial data can help organizations to make informed decisions, boost operational efficiency, predict maintenance needs, enable faster decision\\-making, foster innovation, and improve sustainability and safety standards.
   

  

 There’s a big difference between having data and making it work. Less than 20% of data generated by industrial companies is actually used. Even less is analyzed. This means up to 80% of data is simply lost. ABB is changing that. ABB Genix™ combines the power of industrial analytics and artificial intelligence into an enterprise\\-grade digital platform and suite. Genix unlocks the value of contextualized data through IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things), improving industrial productivity and operational excellence.
   

  

 Genix unlocks the true value of industrial data by seamlessly integrating Operational Technology (OT), Information Technology (IT), and Engineering Technology (ET) across all layers of the enterprise. The platform helps unify siloed data, scale digital initiatives efficiently, and align technology outcomes with business goals — enabling companies to evolve into intelligent, agile, and future\\-ready enterprises.
