**About Us**
**Skydda.ai** 
 is building an
 **AI\\-powered Security Operations Center (AI SOC)** 
 that helps security teams detect, investigate, and respond to threats faster.
   

  

 We’re combining
 **AI reasoning** 
 and
 **automation** 
 to make SOCs smarter, more efficient, and proactive against modern cyber threats.
   

  

**Role Overview**
 We’re looking for a
 **Java Software Engineer** 
 to focus on
 **secure connectivity and platform engineering** 
 within our product.
   

  

 You’ll help our platform connect seamlessly with a wide range of external systems — from SIEMs and SOARs to EDRs and identity providers and OSINT — ensuring data flows securely, reliably, and at scale.
   

  

 This role is perfect for someone who enjoys solving real\\-world integration challenges, securing data exchange, and working on systems that directly impact how modern SOCs respond to threats.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Build and maintain secure integrations with third\\-party APIs (security and IT platforms).
* Handle API variability — different schemas, rate limits, pagination, and data models.
* Implement authentication and authorization using standards like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SAML.
* Develop modular, reusable connectors and enhance integration frameworks.
* Collaborate with backend engineers to define scalable patterns for connectivity and data exchange.
* Write clear, maintainable code and documentation for API and authentication workflows.


**What You’ll Bring**
* 1–3 years of experience in Java backend development.
* Strong understanding of REST APIs, JSON, and integration best practices.
* Experience working with external services or third\\-party APIs.
* Familiarity with secure authentication protocols (OAuth2, OIDC, SAML).
* Solid debugging and problem\\-solving skills with an eye for reliability.
* A growth mindset and the ability to learn quickly in a fast\\-moving environment.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience building connectors or SDKs that integrate with third\\-party platforms.
* Exposure to security or monitoring tools (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel, ServiceNow, CrowdStrike, Elastic, Okta) and interest in cybersecurity, SOC operations, or threat intelligence ecosystems.
* Familiarity with Quarkus for microservices and reactive development.
* Familiarity with API versioning, schema evolution, or contract testing (e.g., Pact).


**Why Join Skydda.ai**
* Be part of a team redefining how SOCs operate through AI and intelligent automation.
* Work on high\\-impact integrations that shape how analysts detect and respond to threats.
* Learn and grow with experienced engineers in the cybersecurity domain.
* Remote\\-first, flexible work environment.
* Competitive compensation and the opportunity to make a real difference.
