**Our Approach to Flexible Work**
 With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in\\-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in\\-office each week, we simply
 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

* Apply SRE principles (SLIs, SLOs, SLAs) to guarantee platform reliability and uptime.


**Security, Governance \\& Compliance**
* Embed DevSecOps best practices across the infrastructure lifecycle, including policy\\-as\\-code, vulnerability scanning, and secrets management.
* Enforce identity and access management (IAM), network segmentation, and data encryption in compliance with standards (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, FedRAMP).
* Collaborate with enterprise security and compliance teams to implement governance frameworks for GenAI platforms.


**Monitoring, Observability \\& Cost Optimization**
