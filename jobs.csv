 About Regie.ai
 
  





 Regie.ai is a Series B\\-funded, AI\\-native sales engagement automation platform focused on fixing one of the hardest problems in revenue: top\\-of\\-the\\-funnel prospecting.
 



 As the effort required to book meetings keeps increasing, traditional sales tools have failed to scale. Critical prospecting work remains incomplete, fragmented across tools, and heavily manual.
 



 Regie.ai closes this gap by combining Generative AI, Agentic AI, and Big Data into a single, unified platform. By bringing together multi\\-line dialing, enrichment, intent signals, email, and social automation, we enable sales reps and their AI agents to deliver signal\\-driven engagement across the entire TAM, without tool sprawl.
