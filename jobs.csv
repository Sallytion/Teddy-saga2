* Perform feature engineering, model tuning, and validation to ensure that models are production\\-ready and optimized for performance
* Build, test, and deploy real\\-time prediction models, maintaining version control and performance tracking


**To thrive in this role, you must have:**

* TimeBack: Educational platform enabling Alpha School's 2\\-hour learning model (99th percentile test results).
* Incept: Content generation platform producing all personalized educational content for multiple learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
* Crossover: AI\\-powered hiring platform handling tens of thousands of applicants monthly, staffing schools and companies across the globe.


 You will take ownership of one platform and dedicate most of your time to implementing the most complex components of the codebase with a small team (3\\-5 strong engineers, no juniors). Your architectural choices will dictate whether other teams can build new applications rapidly, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Correct decisions unlock massive leverage. Poor choices generate integration chaos and destroy velocity across multiple teams.
   

  

 You design, build, and operate your systems. You define quality standards and patterns for your platform. We follow a spec\\-driven approach: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. High autonomy, no committees, no review boards. Small, focused team where you are accountable for what you deliver.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Drive strategic architectural decisions and define technical patterns for the team.
* AI Leadership: Champion adoption of emerging AI workflows and develop high\\-impact playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the complex, mission\\-critical portions of the codebase with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality standards.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Serving as an architect who does not implement
* Spending time in endless meetings
* Managing people (this is technical leadership, not people management)
* Maintaining legacy systems or internal IT infrastructure


**Basic Requirements**
**Senior Software Architect key responsibilities**
* At least 5 years of professional software development experience building software products
* At least 3 years in a lead engineer role (reviewing others' work) or architect role (making key technical decisions)
* Experience developing platform\\-level products where other teams consumed your APIs
* Deep engagement with AI tools, actively experimenting and pushing boundaries
