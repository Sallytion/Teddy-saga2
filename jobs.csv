We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in\\-office each week, we simply
 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
   

  

 At Workday, we are committed to providing an accessible and inclusive hiring experience where all candidates can fully demonstrate their skills. If you require assistance or an accommodation at any point, please email accommodations@workday.com.
   

  

**Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!**
 At Workday, we value our candidates’ privacy and data security. Workday will never ask candidates to apply to jobs through websites that are not Workday Careers.
   

  

 Please be aware of sites that may ask for you to input your data in connection with a job posting that appears to be from Workday but is not.
   

  

 In addition, Workday will never ask candidates to pay a recruiting fee, or pay for consulting or coaching services, in order to apply for a job at Workday.

You are equally comfortable debugging a Swiss Ephemeris call as you are discussing Nirayana vs Sayana coordinate systems.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities:** 



* Write Python verification scripts using pyswisseph (Swiss Ephemeris Python bindings) and/or Skyfield to independently compute and verify: Planetary longitudes (geocentric, apparent) for any given date/time/location, Nirayana longitude conversion by applying specified Ayanamsa (Lahiri, Krishnamurti, Raman, etc.), Ascendant (Lagna) degree computation for given birth data, House cusp calculations (Equal, Placidus, Koch, or Whole Sign systems), Nakshatra and Pada determination from computed longitude, Sunrise/Sunset times for given coordinates and dates
* Build automated test harnesses that validate batches of Kundali computation problems against ephemeris\\-derived ground truth
* Create 10\\-15 code\\-verified evaluation problems per month where the ground truth is algorithmically generated and independently verified
* Document discrepancies between different ephemeris sources and Ayanamsa systems, with quantified error margins
* Develop utility scripts for Panchang element computation: Tithi from Sun\\-Moon elongation, Nakshatra from Moon longitude, Yoga from Sun\\+Moon longitude, Karana from Tithi subdivision
* Create a verification pipeline that can be used by non\\-coding team members to spot\\-check their manually created problems
* Collaborate with classical scholars (Roles A\\-D) to translate traditional calculation methods into code and identify edge cases



  





**Required Qualifications:** 



* Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Physics, Astronomy, or Mathematics
* Minimum 3 years of professional Python development experience
* Demonstrated proficiency with at least one of the following astronomical computation libraries: pyswisseph (Python extension to the Swiss Ephemeris — github.com/astrorigin/pyswisseph): Provides high\\-precision planetary position computation, house cusp calculation, Ayanamsa application, eclipse computation, and all major coordinate transformations used in both Western and Vedic astrology. Must understand functions like swe\\_calc\\_ut(), swe\\_houses(), swe\\_set\\_sid\\_mode() for sidereal/Nirayana calculations; Skyfield (Elegant astronomy for Python — github.com/skyfielders/python\\-skyfield): Modern Pythonic library for high\\-accuracy positional astronomy using JPL ephemeris data. Must understand loading ephemeris files (de421\\.bsp), computing planetary positions, coordinate transforms (ecliptic, equatorial), and time scale handling (UT1, TDB, TT)
* Understanding of the conceptual difference between Sayana (tropical) and Nirayana (sidereal) coordinate systems and how Ayanamsa bridges them
* Familiarity with astronomical time systems (UT, UTC, IST, Julian Date) and coordinate systems (ecliptic longitude/latitude, right ascension/declination)
* Basic understanding of Vedic Astrology concepts: Rashi, Nakshatra, Lagna, Bhava, Graha — enough to understand what the calculations mean in Jyotish context
* Strong documentation skills — ability to write clear, reproducible code with comments explaining both the astronomical and astrological significance of each computation step



  





**Preferred / Nice\\-to\\-Have:** 



* Active contributions to open\\-source Jyotish or astronomy projects
* Experience with Jyotish software development (web apps, mobile apps, or desktop tools for horoscope generation)
* Knowledge of DE430/DE431 JPL ephemeris files and their precision characteristics
* Understanding of Surya Siddhanta algorithms and how they compare to modern ephemeris
* Published work or blog posts on computational astrology
* Familiarity with Lahiri vs Krishnamurti vs Raman Ayanamsa values and their year\\-by\\-year differences
* Experience with geodetic calculations (latitude/longitude to local sidereal time conversion)



  





**Tools \\& Technologies:** 



* Python 3\\.8\\+ with NumPy, pandas, datetime/pytz
* pyswisseph (pip install pyswisseph) — Swiss Ephemeris bindings for planetary computation

**CognitivTrust Inc is Looking for:******
 About CognitivTrust CognitivTrust is building the security infrastructure layer for the Agentic SDLC era. As AI fundamentally transforms how software is written, we''''''''re creating the platform that makes it safe to ship at AI speed. We sit between AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot) and enterprise security stacks—providing real\\-time security context where code is born. The Role We''''''''re looking for an AI Engineer to design and build fully autonomous agents that power our security platform. You''''''''ll create systems that reason, act, and adapt—agents that analyze code, identify vulnerabilities, orchestrate remediation, and integrate with complex enterprise environments without human intervention. This isn''''''''t prompt engineering. This is building production\\-grade agentic systems that operate reliably at scale. What You''''''''ll Do
   

  

* Design and implement autonomous agents for security analysis, threat modeling, and remediation
* Build multi\\-agent orchestration systems with configurable autonomy levels
* Develop agent runtime infrastructure—memory, planning, tool use, guardrails
* Create evaluation frameworks to measure agent reliability and safety
* Integrate agents with MCP (Model Context Protocol) for seamless tool connectivity
* Ship production systems that run unsupervised in enterprise environments What You Bring Core Engineering
* Strong software engineering fundamentals (Python, distributed systems)
* Experience building and deploying production systems at scale
* Deep understanding of agent architectures—ReAct, tool use, planning, reflection Enterprise Agent Experience
* Built and deployed autonomous agents in enterprise production environments—not prototypes, not demos
* Implemented end\\-to\\-end agentic workflows that handle real business processes with minimal human oversight
* Designed agents that integrate with enterprise systems (APIs, databases, SaaS platforms) and handle authentication, rate limits, and failure recovery gracefully
* Experience with agent observability—logging, tracing, debugging autonomous systems in production
* Built human\\-in\\-the\\-loop checkpoints and escalation paths for high\\-stakes agent decisions Agentic Systems Design
* Hands\\-on experience designing multi\\-agent systems with clear task decomposition and coordination
* Implemented configurable autonomy levels—knowing when agents should act vs. ask
* Built evaluation and testing frameworks for non\\-deterministic agent behavior
* Experience with agent memory systems—short\\-term context, long\\-term knowledge, retrieval
* Familiarity with agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen) or built custom orchestration layers Bonus
* Security domain knowledge (AppSec, DevSecOps, vulnerability management)
* Experience with MCP or similar agent\\-tool protocols
* Background in enterprise software or B2B SaaS What Sets You Apart
* You''''''''ve built agents that run autonomously in production for weeks, not hours
* You think in systems—reliability, observability, failure modes, edge cases
* You''''''''re obsessed with evaluation and know that vibes\\-based testing doesn''''''''t scale
* You understand that enterprise means auditability, compliance, and zero surprises
* You ship fast and iterate based on real\\-world feedback
