Whether you're building smarter solutions, supporting customers, or creating a space where everyone belongs, you’ll do meaningful work with Workmates who’ve got your back. In return, we’ll give you the trust to take risks, the tools to grow, the skills to develop and the support of a company invested in you for the long haul. So, if you want to inspire a brighter work day for everyone, including yourself, you’ve found a match in Workday, and we hope to be a match for you too.
   

  

**About The Team**
 The Globalization Platform org's mission is to develop and evolve the internationalization and localization platforms of Workday while building out new agentic AI capabilities. Our ambition is to provide a fit\\-for\\-purpose language experience to our customers by partnering with internal teams through innovative and emerging technology capabilities. Our engineering teams are passionate about automation and leveraging cutting edge AI technologies to drive innovation, leading to a brighter Workday for all. We value collaboration, effective communication and accountability.

 You will play a key part in designing and developing the future localisation and agentic AI capabilities for Workday to achieve our internationalization and localization strategies by leveraging the power of AI. You will lead by example, demonstrating architecture and development best practices, while mentoring and empowering your fellow team members to achieve success.
   

  

**About You**
 Basic Qualification
   

  

* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent practical experience.
* 8\\+ years of professional experience in developing, deploying, and maintaining enterprise\\-level software applications.
* Demonstrated strong understanding and practical application of Object\\-Oriented Design (OOD) principles and Object\\-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages (e.g., Java, C\\+\\+, Python, C\\#).
* Practical experience with AI/ML concepts, frameworks, or tools, including experience in one or more of the following: developing AI\\-powered features, working with large datasets for model training, or integrating ML models into production systems.


 Other Qualification

**Our Approach to Flexible Work**
 With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in\\-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in\\-office each week, we simply
 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
   

  

**Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!**
 At Workday, we value our candidates’ privacy and data security. Workday will never ask candidates to apply to jobs through websites that are not Workday Careers.
   

  

 Please be aware of sites that may ask for you to input your data in connection with a job posting that appears to be from Workday but is not.
   

  

 In addition, Workday will never ask candidates to pay a recruiting fee, or pay for consulting or coaching services, in order to apply for a job at Workday.
