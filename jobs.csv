 An actor playing drunk isn't actually drunk—and when they're good, you can't tell the difference. Now apply that to AI.
 



  





 We have no reliable way to distinguish a genuinely aligned AI from one that's just really, really good at pretending. An AI can pass every safety test, say all the right things, behave perfectly for years—and still be performing. By the time we figure out which one we built, it might be too late.
 



  





 What You'll Do
 



  




* Develop techniques to detect deceptive alignment in AI systems
* Create evaluation methods that go beyond behavioral testing
* Research the conditions under which AI systems might develop misaligned goals while appearing aligned
* Build tools to probe the true ""intentions"" of AI models
