**About the Company** 




 We build software that powers the daily operations of waste and recycling organizations globally.

* Create and execute automated API, integration, and end\\-to\\-end test suites
* Select, evolve, and standardize testing tools and frameworks
* Integrate automated tests seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines
* Validate database changes and migrations (SQL Server, PostgreSQL)
* Perform deep root cause analysis for defects and test failures
* Partner with engineers to shift quality left and improve testability
* Provide guidance for manual testing efforts when required
* Mentor QA and engineering teams on quality best practices
* Explore and leverage AI\\-assisted testing techniques where appropriate
* Customer obsession — ensure quality decisions reflect real customer workflows and reliability expectations



  





**Required Skills \\& Experience** 



* 5\\+ years of experience as an SDET / SDAT / QA Automation Engineer
* Strong experience building and maintaining test automation frameworks (Cypress or Selenium)
* Solid experience with API and backend testing
* Strong programming skills (C\\#, Java, or similar)
* Experience validating database changes and migrations
* Experience working in Agile / Scrum environments
* Ability to collaborate effectively in distributed, cross\\-functional teams
* Clear communication skills with an engineering\\-first mindset



  





**Nice to Have** 



* Experience testing .NET Core and microservices architectures
* Experience with AWS\\-based systems
* Exposure to AI\\-based or intelligent testing tools
* Experience influencing test strategy at a platform level
* Experience mentoring or scaling QA practices across teams



  





**Why Join Us** 



* Ownership of automation strategy and quality tooling
* Opportunity to influence engineering standards across the platform
* Work on real\\-world systems with meaningful customer impact
* Collaborative, engineering\\-driven culture with high trust and autonomy
* A modernizing platform with long\\-term growth opportunities","Software Development","https://in.linkedin.com/company/summit-consulting-services-pvt-ltd","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHuwHHSqmX_Yg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1728980254910/summit_consulting_services_pvt_ltd_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ra61wXgW_QIVr50p9_YhH3IGjxNViOCFDERt-2YtYrE","","","","","","","","","","",""
