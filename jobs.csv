The tech team in RBS develops automation that leverages Machine/Deep Learning to scale execution of these high complex tasks that currently require human cognitive skills. Our solutions ensure that information in Amazon's catalog is complete, correct and, comprehensive enough to give Amazon customers a great shopping experience every time. We are building solutions to move towards retail automation and are using latest technology like LLM to solve business problems.
   

  

 We believe in “Work Hard. Have Fun. Make History” value by having a strong focus on sharing learning experiences from the front line with the development teams. So, the options for people in the team are vast. If you like mastering a domain and going deep, we need you. If you can juggle three tasks and coordinate with multiple people in the heat of an incident, we need you. If you love the benefits of process and methodical improvement, you will love it here. If you want to keep your head down, headphones on, and bash out code to support the team, we have a spot for you too.
