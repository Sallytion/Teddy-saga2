* Contribute to code reviews and adopt engineering best practices to ensure high\\-quality, maintainable code.
* Participate in the design and discussion of new product features, bringing a fresh perspective to solving real customer problems.
* Learn Rippling’s tech stack and architecture while receiving mentorship and support from experienced engineers.
* Continuously improve through team\\-led workshops, 1:1 mentorship, and on\\-the\\-job learning.
* Play an active role in shaping the future of accounting automation at Rippling.


 What you will need
   

  

* 1–2 years of experience at fast\\-paced, high\\-growth product companies.
* Proficiency in one or more programming languages such as Java, Python, C\\+\\+, or Go.
* Strong grasp of computer science fundamentals including data structures, algorithms, and software design principles.
* Understanding of system design concepts and distributed systems architecture.
* Ability to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code while maintaining a fast development velocity.
* Clear communication skills and the ability to work collaboratively in a cross\\-functional team
* A proactive mindset with eagerness to learn new technologies and tackle real\\-world engineering challenges
* Bonus: Open source contributions, competitive programming experience, or a strong CS foundation from a Tier 1 institution


 Tech Stack: Python, Go, Postgres, Kafka, Kubernetes, gRPC, AWS.
   

  

**What We Offer**
* A competitive compensation and benefits package.
* The chance to work on high\\-impact, meaningful projects alongside a collaborative and high\\-caliber team.
* Opportunities for continuous learning, growth, and career development.
* An inclusive, fun, and innovative workplace that values diversity and creative thinking.

 Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.
   

  

 Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third\\-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.
   

  

 Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1\\.4B\\+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.
   

  

 We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.
   

  

**About The Team**
 The Payments platform team's mission is to move money quickly and reliably across countries and currencies. As one of Rippling's most mission\\-critical systems, we're responsible for moving tens of billions of dollars annually, with much of it for Payroll, which caters to millions of employees in over 40 countries. Other products that exclusively use the Payments platform include Tax Platform, Billing, Bill Pay, and Travel, among others. Our ultimate goal is for all money moved through Rippling to be orchestrated by our platform.
   

  

 Rippling's global expansion is largely dependent on the payment rails we offer. For instance, Payroll can only expand to onboard employees in New Zealand if our platform can move money from USD to NZD. This involves integrating with FX vendors, banks (like Citi or JPM), and third\\-party fintech solutions (like Nium or Airwallex).
   

  

 As a platform, we put incredible emphasis on reliability, especially since our features depend on third\\-party systems. We process close to 1 million transactions within a few hours during peak times, and even a single dropped or delayed payment can mean an employee doesn't get their paycheck on time. That's why our team takes pride in what we've built and holds a very high bar for reliability. Fault tolerance and scalability are a core part of our design phase, not an afterthought. For engineers looking to create a tangible business impact and step up to a big challenge, this team is one of the best places to be.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Are you looking to be in a role where you can have a significant impact on the company's growth and success? Does the prospect of making the most pragmatic technical decisions, which will drastically shape the future of the products excite you? Our Finance Platform org is looking for a seasoned

* Lead incident response and on\\-call responsibilities as an incident commander for Payment platform, performing postmortem analysis across multiple stacks and driving action items to completion to prevent future failures.
