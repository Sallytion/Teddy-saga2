We believe Roku’s continued success relies on its investment in our machine learning/ML recommendation engine. Roku enables our users to access millions of contents including movies, episodes, news, sports, music and channels from all around the world.

 We’re on a mission to build cutting\\-edge advertising technology that empowers businesses to run sustainable and highly\\-profitable campaigns. The Ad Performance team owns server technologies, data, and cloud services aimed at improving the ad experience. We're looking for seasoned engineers with a background in machine learning to aid in this mission.

**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

***About Radix:***




*REVOLUTIONISING THE INTERNET:* 




 We started out in 2012 as a part of the Bhavin Turakhia led Directi Group, which has been a prominent player in the web presence industry since the 90s. The meteoric rise in the number of websites back then led to an acute shortage of quality domain names. The depleting name pool within the .com / .net led to growing customer dissatisfaction as first choice names became impossible to find! We knew that domain names had to evolve in order to serve their purpose of memorable online identities.
 



**Enter Radix.** 




 When the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) opened the door to new top level domains other than the .com, .net, .org etc., we knew it was the perfect opportunity to solve a growing customer problem.
 



 Equipped with powerful and meaningful new extensions such as .tech, .online, .store, .fun, .site, .press etc. we set out on a mission to eliminate the distinction between the real names and internet addresses of individuals and businesses. We started with an audacious goal of building a world where domain names are less like phone numbers which need to be written and stored and more like brand names which are easily remembered. And here we are, with more than 9 million domains already registered on our extensions, we are well on the path towards revolutionizing the internet. Brands like Mr. Beast (www.mrbeast.store), Viacom (www.viacom.tech), Emirates (emirates.store), Doordash (order.online), CES (ces.tech), Shakira (www.shakira.store) and many more have already made the switch. Its only a matter of time before the rest of the world does it too. To sum it up, the internet history is being rewritten and Radix is at the core of it.
 



  





*Quick Stats:* 




 Founded: 2012
 



 Strength: 80\\+ employees
