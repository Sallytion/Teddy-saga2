 We are looking for young engineers who will grow into leaders, not task executors.
 



 What we expect
 



  




* Basic coding knowledge (Python or Node.js or React)
* Passion for learning \\& building
* Startup mindset \\- open to new roles, new ideas and new challenges every week
* Reliability \\& consistency \\- ideas are great, but execution builds careers
