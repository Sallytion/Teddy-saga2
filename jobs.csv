**About Kagaar:** 




 Kagaar is a unified community platform designed to turn high\\-quality ideas into real companies.
 



 We are building an early\\-stage, mission\\-driven product that fundamentally improves how founders, startups, creators, and investors connect, collaborate, and compound momentum.
 



  





 We are currently forming a lean founding team of exceptional engineers who will own core technical decisions and directly shape Kagaar’s product, systems, and long\\-term trajectory.
 



  





 This is not a conventional engineering role. As a Founding Software Development Engineer, you will operate as a true owner—driving critical technical decisions, building core product systems from the ground up, and partnering closely with leadership on execution and strategy.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 We are seeking an experienced Full Stack Engineer who has previously built and shipped products in SaaS\\-based startup environments. The ideal candidate has worked in high\\-ownership, venture\\-backed companies, understands early\\-stage ambiguity, and has demonstrated the ability to take products from concept to production.
 



 This role is strictly equity\\-based and intended for individuals who are aligned with long\\-term value creation rather than short\\-term compensation.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities:** 



* Architect, design, develop, and deploy core full\\-stack features in a fast\\-paced startup environment.
* Build scalable, secure, and high\\-performance backend systems that can support rapid growth.
* Develop responsive, intuitive frontend interfaces with a strong emphasis on user experience.
* Take ownership of product features end\\-to\\-end, from technical design to production rollout.
* Collaborate closely with product, design, and leadership teams to align engineering with business goals.
* Write clean, maintainable, and well\\-documented production\\-grade code.
* Continuously evaluate and adopt modern development practices, tools, and frameworks where appropriate.



  





**Mandatory Requirements ( Non Negotiables ):** 




 Candidates must meet all of the following criteria to be considered:
 


* Minimum 3 years of professional experience as a Full Stack Engineer.
* Prior experience working at a SaaS\\-based startup, with direct involvement in building and shipping a real\\-world product.
* Experience at YC\\-backed companies or startups funded by top\\-tier venture capital firms (e.g., Y Combinator, Sequoia, a16z, Accel, Lightspeed, etc.).
* *This is a mandatory requirement.*
* Proven ability to work in early\\-stage environments with high ownership and minimal hand\\-holding.



  





**Technical Requirements:** 



* Strong proficiency in Next.js, React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Solid backend experience with Node.js and Express.js (Python or Java experience is a plus).
* Hands\\-on experience with databases such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.
* Strong system design fundamentals and problem\\-solving skills.
* Ability to independently drive execution in a fully remote setup.
* Clear, concise communication skills with a bias toward action.



*Educational background from institutions such as IITs, IIITs, BITS, VIT, or equivalent is preferred but not mandatory.* 




  





**Why Join Kagaar:** 



* Be part of the founding engineering team, influencing both product and company direction from day one.
* Work with high autonomy in a fast\\-moving, outcome\\-driven environment.
* Gain meaningful founding equity tied directly to your long\\-term impact and ownership.
* Collaborate within a transparent, learning\\-focused, and execution\\-oriented culture.



  





**Equity \\& Compensation:** 




 This is a strictly equity\\-only role. There is no fixed salary or cash compensation at this stage.
 



 Founding equity allocation will be determined based on:
 


* Depth and relevance of prior startup and SaaS experience.
* Technical leadership and execution capability.
* Long\\-term commitment and alignment with Kagaar’s vision.



 This structure reflects our belief in shared ownership and long\\-term value creation.
 



  





**Important Note:** 




 This role is intended only for candidates who fully understand and are genuinely prepared for the risks, responsibilities, and expectations of an early\\-stage, equity\\-only startup role.
 



 If you are not aligned with this model, we respectfully request that you do not apply.
 



  





**Application Process:** 




 To apply:
 


* Email your resume and a brief cover letter to hireme@kagaar.in
* Complete the mandatory application form:

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200\\+ colleagues in 75\\+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.
   

  

 The company is founder led, profitable and growing.
   

  

 We are hiring engineers to work across the breadth of our Ubuntu Engineering organisation \\- engineers who care deeply for quality, performance and resilience in software, engineers who are just as comfortable with designing and engineering new software as they are with packaging, integrating, testing and shipping the incredible catalog of open source software provided by the Ubuntu repositories.
   

  

 Our engineers integrate the freshest open source software, provide robust upgrade paths and engineer the future of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is not just the world's most deployed open source operating system, it's a platform that enables innovation for millions of users across the globe. Our community represents the full breadth of the developer experience; from students, hobbyists and freelancers to high performance engineering and creative teams in corporate and academic environments.
   

  

 The four key teams that ship Ubuntu are:
   

  

* **Foundations** 
 : maintaining foundational software: architectures, package managers, compilers, toolchains, bootloaders, filesystems and core utilities
* **Server:** 
 leading the design, evolution and future of our Ubuntu Server distribution
* **Desktop:** 
 driving Ubuntu Desktop, our future immutable desktop: Ubuntu Core Desktop, WSL, gaming technology, and a suite of modern applications for the desktop crafted with Flutter
* **Debcrafters:** 
 a new team responsible for the forward movement, maintenance and overall health of the Ubuntu archive: one of the most abundant repositories of open source software available today


 Bring your existing expertise and learn new skills by working on one of the most prolific pieces of open source software. As an engineer working on Ubuntu you could work on any or all of the following categories:
   

  

* **Development** 
 : design, build and ship new foundational systems software and applications in Rust, Go, Flutter, and Python
* **Architecture** 
 : engineer the integration of open source from boot firmware to cloud applications deployment
* **Packaging** 
 : a combination of Debian and Snap packaging to ship software in the distribution
* **Automation** 
 : build and maintain the machinery responsible for building, testing and shipping Ubuntu
* **Distro Engineering** 
 : the maintenance and evolution of a Linux distribution and its repositories


 This application track is suitable for those at the mid point in their career but perhaps not quite at the Manager/Lead level, with relevant skills to contribute to Ubuntu.

Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200\\+ colleagues in 75\\+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.
   

  

 The company is founder led, profitable and growing.
   

  

 We are hiring engineers to work across the breadth of our Ubuntu Engineering organisation \\- engineers who care deeply for quality, performance and resilience in software, engineers who are just as comfortable with designing and engineering new software as they are with packaging, integrating, testing and shipping the incredible catalog of open source software provided by the Ubuntu repositories.
   

  

 Our engineers integrate the freshest open source software, provide robust upgrade paths and engineer the future of Ubuntu. Ubuntu is not just the world's most deployed open source operating system, it's a platform that enables innovation for millions of users across the globe. Our community represents the full breadth of the developer experience; from students, hobbyists and freelancers to high performance engineering and creative teams in corporate and academic environments.
   

  

 The four key teams that ship Ubuntu are:
   

  

* **Foundations** 
 : maintaining foundational software: architectures, package managers, compilers, toolchains, bootloaders, filesystems and core utilities
* **Server:** 
 leading the design, evolution and future of our Ubuntu Server distribution
* **Desktop:** 
 driving Ubuntu Desktop, our future immutable desktop: Ubuntu Core Desktop, WSL, gaming technology, and a suite of modern applications for the desktop crafted with Flutter
* **Debcrafters:** 
 a new team responsible for the forward movement, maintenance and overall health of the Ubuntu archive: one of the most abundant repositories of open source software available today


 Bring your existing expertise and learn new skills by working on one of the most prolific pieces of open source software. As an engineer working on Ubuntu you could work on any or all of the following categories:
   

  

* **Development** 
 : design, build and ship new foundational systems software and applications in Rust, Go, Flutter, and Python
* **Architecture** 
 : engineer the integration of open source from boot firmware to cloud applications deployment
* **Packaging** 
 : a combination of Debian and Snap packaging to ship software in the distribution
* **Automation** 
 : build and maintain the machinery responsible for building, testing and shipping Ubuntu
* **Distro Engineering** 
 : the maintenance and evolution of a Linux distribution and its repositories


 This application track is suitable for those at the mid point in their career but perhaps not quite at the Manager/Lead level, with relevant skills to contribute to Ubuntu.
