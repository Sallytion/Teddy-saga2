 Key job responsibilities
   

  

 The ideal candidate has current and extensive experience developing and building device systems and applications. The candidate understands what the limitations of the platform are and can design and implement additional services or help optimize existing ones to meet the product requirements. Partners closely with ODM/OEMs to launch Alexa Built\\-In devices.
   

  

 This PE role requires independently navigating large Alexa organizations with independent roadmaps and shepherding ideating, building and launching of Alexa LLM experiences on 3P devices, building primitives aligned with overall Alexa architecture and reusable beyond ABI on other device types and surfaces and other use cases such as Alexa Kids or Alexa Smart Vehicles. This leader has to play the role of a horizontal systems thinker who can look across the board and intervene with the right solutions for a plethora of 1P Alexa capabilities (Comms, Smart Home capabilities, Camera etc) working properly on a variety of 3P devices. This PE will drive brand new device specific capabilities for a wide range of 3P devices and seamless experiences between a constellation of 1P and 3P devices.
