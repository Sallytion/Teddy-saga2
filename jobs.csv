Founded in 2014 by Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar with a simple vision — to simplify payments for Indian businesses — we’ve since grown into a fintech powerhouse driving India’s digital payment revolution.
   

  

 Razorpay powers millions of businesses with a smarter, scalable stack that goes beyond transactions to help them truly build and grow.
   

  

 From seamless checkouts to payroll automation, across India, Singapore, and Malaysia, we’ve been engineering a fintech ecosystem that’s redefining how money moves across Asia — and we’re just getting started.
   

  

 Today, that ecosystem supports everyone from early\\-stage startups to some of India’s largest enterprises, enabling them to accept, process, and disburse payments at scale while expanding into new ways of managing money more efficiently.
   

  

 Our scale speaks volumes: Razorpay processes $180\\+ billion in annualized transactions, powering leading businesses like Airbnb, Facebook, WhatsApp, Airtel, CRED, BookmyShow, Zomato, Swiggy, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme — and over 100 of India’s unicorns. With strong roots in India and growing operations in Southeast Asia, we are shaping the next chapter of financial technology across the region.
   

  

 We are backed by global investors including GIC, Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India \\& SEA), Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, MasterCard, and Salesforce Ventures, having raised over $740 million to date. Strategic acquisitions — including Ezetap (POS and offline payments), Curlec (Malaysia expansion), BillMe (digital invoicing), and POP (rewards\\-first UPI) — along with earlier moves in fraud prevention, payroll, and lending, have further strengthened our platform and widened our footprint across Asia.
   

  

 But what truly sets Razorpay apart is our culture. At Razorpay, ownership is our oxygen — you own what you build, with no micromanagement or red tape, just the runway to make your ideas fly. Learning is a lifestyle — if you’re curious, you’ll feel at home here. People \\> Pedigree — we hire for attitude, hustle, and hunger more than degrees. Transparency thrives over titles — this is where interns question CXOs and CXOs say “thank you.” Guided by our values of Customer First, Autonomy \\& Ownership, Agility with Integrity, Transparency, Challenging the status quo and a strong belief that Razorpay grows with Razors, you’ll be part of a 3000\\+ strong team building not just products, but the financial infrastructure of the future.
   

  

**The Role**
 A lead software development engineer at Razorpay is well\\-grounded \\- innovative, quality focussed, product thinker, and business conscious \\- not mere coders, of course, with deeper technical context and experience to build quality software. You should be able to see nuances and elements that others might not. Engineering creates a significant impact across different areas, considering the scale of our software product outreach. You’re also expected to influence the culture of the company and help shape it in the right way.
   

  

**Roles And Responsibilities**
* Be involved and drive product \\& design discussions.
* Help us scale our payment infrastructure to get every Indian to pay online.
* Help us make decisions to shape our REST APIs for developers worldwide.
* Contribute to open source as we set the standards for mobile payments.
* Be involved and drive product \\& design discussions.
* And, most importantly, brainstorm and create new directions that Razorpay can take in our quest to make online payments easy and accessible to all.


**Mandatory Qualifications**
* 5\\+ years of experience in Technology.
* A strong product design sense.
* Good experience in working with any of the programming languages like PHP, Python, Django, Golang, Java, C\\+\\+
* Understand end\\-user requirements, formulate use cases and come up with effective solutions.

Founded in 2014 by Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar with a simple vision — to simplify payments for Indian businesses — we’ve since grown into a fintech powerhouse driving India’s digital payment revolution.
   

  

 Razorpay powers millions of businesses with a smarter, scalable stack that goes beyond transactions to help them truly build and grow.
   

  

 From seamless checkouts to payroll automation, across India, Singapore, and Malaysia, we’ve been engineering a fintech ecosystem that’s redefining how money moves across Asia — and we’re just getting started.
   

  

 Today, that ecosystem supports everyone from early\\-stage startups to some of India’s largest enterprises, enabling them to accept, process, and disburse payments at scale while expanding into new ways of managing money more efficiently.
   

  

 Our scale speaks volumes: Razorpay processes $180\\+ billion in annualized transactions, powering leading businesses like Airbnb, Facebook, WhatsApp, Airtel, CRED, BookmyShow, Zomato, Swiggy, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme — and over 100 of India’s unicorns. With strong roots in India and growing operations in Southeast Asia, we are shaping the next chapter of financial technology across the region.
   

  

 We are backed by global investors including GIC, Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India \\& SEA), Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, MasterCard, and Salesforce Ventures, having raised over $740 million to date. Strategic acquisitions — including Ezetap (POS and offline payments), Curlec (Malaysia expansion), BillMe (digital invoicing), and POP (rewards\\-first UPI) — along with earlier moves in fraud prevention, payroll, and lending, have further strengthened our platform and widened our footprint across Asia.
   

  

 But what truly sets Razorpay apart is our culture. At Razorpay, ownership is our oxygen — you own what you build, with no micromanagement or red tape, just the runway to make your ideas fly. Learning is a lifestyle — if you’re curious, you’ll feel at home here. People \\> Pedigree — we hire for attitude, hustle, and hunger more than degrees. Transparency thrives over titles — this is where interns question CXOs and CXOs say “thank you.” Guided by our values of Customer First, Autonomy \\& Ownership, Agility with Integrity, Transparency, Challenging the status quo and a strong belief that Razorpay grows with Razors, you’ll be part of a 3000\\+ strong team building not just products, but the financial infrastructure of the future.
   

  

**Title: Lead Software Engineer**
**The Role**
 A Lead Software Development Engineer at Razorpay is well\\-grounded \\- innovative, quality focussed, product thinker, and business conscious \\- not mere coders, of course, with deeper technical context and experience to build quality software. You should be able to see nuances and elements that others might not. Engineering creates a significant impact across different areas, considering the scale of our software product outreach.
   

  

 You’re also expected to influence the culture of the company and help shape it in the right way.
   

  

**Role And Responsibilities**
* 8\\+ years of total experience in software development, with at least 2 years in the leading technical team. Strong programming skills, with experience in Golang as an SDE.
* Proven track record in building and managing developer productivity platforms, tools, and processes.
* Experience with CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure (AWS preferred), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and automation tools (e.g., Jenkins, Terraform).
* Experience in distributed systems, handling large\\-scale data processing, and maintaining high\\-performance products.
* Deep understanding of AI\\-driven developer tools, code generation/testing, and their integration into development workflows.
* Strong communication and problem\\-solving skills, with a data\\-driven approach to decision\\-making
