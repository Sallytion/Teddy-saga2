 We are part of the Batch Control Plane team within Uber's Data Platform under platform engineering, building the foundational systems that power Uber's data lake. These systems sit at the core of Uber \\- enabling analytics, data science, and AI workloads that drive pricing, payments, routing, forecasting, and machine learning across the company.
   

  

 We operate at massive scale, storing exabytes of data and serving hundreds of petabytes every day via billions of requests. Reliability, correctness, and performance are non\\-negotiable \\- when these systems move, the company moves with them.
   

  

 Uber is in the middle of a once\\-in\\-a\\-career platform transformation: evolving from an on\\-prem, single\\-region data stack to an industry\\-leading multi\\-cloud, multi\\-region architecture. This isn't a lift\\-and\\-shift. It's a rebuild \\- happening live, with hundreds of thousands of production pipelines continuing to run.
   

  

 To make this possible, the team works across a few deeply connected problem areas:
   

  

* Metadata \\& catalog systems that help thousands of engineers reliably discover and access data
* Large\\-scale cloud migration of data and pipelines without breaking production
* Disaster recovery for a hybrid on\\-prem and cloud platform as the move to cloud accelerates ensuring reliability all the way.
* Data lifecycle, governance, and compliance, ensuring data is managed as per compliance at global scale.


 It's an opportunity to own core platform infrastructure, solve hard distributed systems problems, and help shape how Uber's data platform evolves over the next several years. You'll learn fast, take real responsibility, and see your work have immediate, company\\-wide impact.
   

  

**What The Candidate Will Need / Bonus Points**

 Develop and extend foundational frameworks enable safe, automated, and scalable migration of data and pipelines.
   

  

 Design systems that determine when, where, and how data should move, balancing correctness, cost, performance, network and reliability across regions and cloud providers.
   

  

 Work on intelligent migration strategies that leverage dependency analysis, access patterns, and MLIP\\-style models to decide optimal movement and placement of data balancing multiple decision variables.
   

  

 Ensure migrations are non\\-disruptive and reversible, with strong observability, safeguards, and automated rollback mechanisms
   

  

 Help shape the long\\-term direction of Uber's data platform by turning one\\-time migration efforts into durable, reusable platform capabilities
