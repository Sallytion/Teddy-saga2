 Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.
   

  

 Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third\\-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.
   

  

 Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1\\.4B\\+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.
   

  

 We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Rippling’s Accounting Integrations team is on a mission to automate the flow of financial data between Rippling’s core products—such as Payroll, Spend, Travel, and Procurement—and external ERPs like NetSuite, QuickBooks, and Xero. We own the underlying infrastructure that enables seamless, bi\\-directional sync between Rippling’s platform and these accounting systems. Our work is critical to enabling accounting books closure: a real\\-time accounting model that helps finance teams move away from manual, month\\-end fire drills toward strategic, high\\-impact work.
   

  

 As an SDE\\-I on the team, you’ll contribute to high\\-impact projects by building scalable, reliable systems that automate key financial processes like data synchronization and reconciliation. You’ll collaborate with senior engineers, product managers, and cross\\-functional teams to deliver features that ensure accuracy, compliance, and visibility into our customers’ financial data.
   

  

 This is a high\\-ownership role where you'll contribute to both new product capabilities and improvements to existing infrastructure.

 If you’re a strong backend engineer who enjoys solving real\\-world business problems at scale, we’d love to work with you.
   

  

**What You Will Do**
* Collaborate with engineers, product managers, and designers to build robust and scalable accounting integration features.
* Design, develop, and maintain systems that automate financial data sync between Rippling and ERPs like NetSuite and QuickBooks.
* Analyze and debug issues in complex, distributed systems to improve reliability and performance.
* Contribute to code reviews and adopt engineering best practices to ensure high\\-quality, maintainable code.
* Participate in the design and discussion of new product features, bringing a fresh perspective to solving real customer problems.
* Learn Rippling’s tech stack and architecture while receiving mentorship and support from experienced engineers.
* Continuously improve through team\\-led workshops, 1:1 mentorship, and on\\-the\\-job learning.
* Play an active role in shaping the future of accounting automation at Rippling.


 What you will need
   

  

* 1–2 years of experience at fast\\-paced, high\\-growth product companies.
* Proficiency in one or more programming languages such as Java, Python, C\\+\\+, or Go.
* Strong grasp of computer science fundamentals including data structures, algorithms, and software design principles.
* Understanding of system design concepts and distributed systems architecture.
* Ability to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code while maintaining a fast development velocity.
* Clear communication skills and the ability to work collaboratively in a cross\\-functional team
* A proactive mindset with eagerness to learn new technologies and tackle real\\-world engineering challenges
* Bonus: Open source contributions, competitive programming experience, or a strong CS foundation from a Tier 1 institution


 Tech Stack: Python, Go, Postgres, Kafka, Kubernetes, gRPC, AWS.
   

  

**What We Offer**
* A competitive compensation and benefits package.
* The chance to work on high\\-impact, meaningful projects alongside a collaborative and high\\-caliber team.
* Opportunities for continuous learning, growth, and career development.
* An inclusive, fun, and innovative workplace that values diversity and creative thinking.
