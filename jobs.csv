 As a Forward Deployed Engineer at SquadStack.ai, you’ll work on building and evolving
 



 production\\-grade Voice AI systems that customers actively use.
 



  





 You’ll operate close to real deployments \\- identifying gaps surfaced by live usage, designing
 



 solutions, and shipping them into production. Some work moves fast; some work is planned and
 



 iterative. What matters is that priorities are driven by real customer outcomes, not by work
 



 defined quarters in advance.
 



  





 You’ll leverage the SquadStack platform to configure, extend, and build AI\\-native workflows,
 



 while writing production\\-quality code where needed. You’ll work in a small pod alongside
 



 Customer Success and AI PM partners, owning technical execution end\\-to\\-end.
 



  





 This role sits at the intersection of engineering, product, and customer reality \\- with a strong
 



 emphasis on code quality, system reliability, and long\\-term leverage over one\\-off fixes.
 



  





 Apply even if you’re only 70% sure. The conversation itself is valuable.
 



 What you'll do
 



 You’ll work in a small pod (CSM / AI PM handles customer communication; you handle technical
 



 execution), solving problems that block customer success but aren’t yet on the product
 



 roadmap.
 



  





 Your engineering work includes:
 



 • Building custom integrations, tools, and AI workflows that unblock customer needs
 



 • Designing and refining AI prompts, RAG systems, and LLM\\-based solutions
 



 • Writing production\\-quality code (Python / JavaScript) with the same standards as core
 



 engineering
 



  





 • Deciding whether solutions should remain custom, become reusable, or move into the
 



 core product
 



 • Collaborating with core engineering teams to upstream learnings and reduce future
 



 friction.
 



 What you will not do:
 



 • Run customer calls
 



 • Own accounts
 



 • Chase stakeholders
 



 • Do repetitive support work
 



 This is NOT solutions engineering
 



 You do not deliver one\\-off scripts and move on
 



 Every solution is evaluated on leverage:
 



 • Can this be reused?
 



 • Can this become a product primitive?
 



 • Can this eliminate future manual work?
 



 Custom work is acceptable only if the business makes sense, or it is experimental, where we’d
 



 learn something new.
 



 Strong solutions frequently get upstreamed into:
 



 • Core platform capabilities
 



 • Reusable internal tooling
 



 • Product roadmap items owned by core engineering","Software Development","https://in.linkedin.com/company/recro-io","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQH7GYOGBCj8Qg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1728907260215/recro_io_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=898rSyj182aC0vqi5cZqbWQQIDumt_WpercCJsH_-TY","","","","","","","","","","",""
