 \\- Build Golang‐based SIP services (registrar, SBC‐like components, routing logic,
 



 monitoring daemons) and internal APIs to control routing, policies, and provisioning.
 



 \\- Configure and operate SIP load balancing, failover, and high‐availability setups
 



 (multi‐node SIP proxies, distributed media servers, RTP proxies).
 



 \\- Implement and maintain dial plans, least‐cost routing, DID management, class‐4/class‐5
 



 style switching logic, and integration with upstream carriers and PSTN gateways.
 



 \\- Own security and robustness of the VoIP stack: TLS/SRTP, authentication/authorization,
 



 rate limiting, fraud detection hooks, and abuse controls.
 



 \\- Integrate the telephony backbone with PBN’s SaaS platform (user accounts, billing,
 



 analytics, AI/automation flows) via well‐defined internal APIs and webhooks.
 



 \\- Define monitoring, alerting, logging, and capacity planning for SIP signaling, RTP/media,

 \\- Collaborate with product and operations to translate business requirements (IVRs, call
 



 queues, routing rules, AI agents) into resilient VoIP and backend designs.
 



  





**Required Qualifications:** 




 \\- 7–10 years of software development experience with at least 4–5 years building or
 



 operating large‐scale VoIP/SIP systems.
 



 \\- Strong Golang skills, including building high‐performance networked services,
 



 concurrent processing, and production‐grade APIs.
 



 \\- Hands‐on experience with at least one open‐source SIP server such as
 



 Kamailio/OpenSIPS and one media/application server such as FreeSWITCH (or
 



 Asterisk), including configuration, routing logic, and troubleshooting.
 



 \\- Deep understanding of SIP, RTP, SDP, NAT traversal, registrar/registrations, B2BUA vs
 



 proxy behavior, and SBC concepts.
 



 \\- Proven ability to design and run highly available telephony backbones: clustering, health
 



 checks, load balancing, and graceful failover.
 



 \\- Strong Linux and networking fundamentals (iptables, firewalls, TCP/UDP, QoS), and
 



 comfort debugging issues at packet‐level using tools like tcpdump/wireshark.
 



 \\- Experience integrating VoIP platforms with RESTful backends, databases (PostgreSQL
 



 or MariaDB/MySQL), and message queues for control and billing workflows.
 



  





**Nice to Have:** 




 \\- Experience with WebRTC, SIP over WebSockets, and browser/mobile softphone
 



 integrations.
 



 \\- Familiarity with VoIP billing, rating engines, CDR processing, and reseller hierarchies
 



 (class‐4/class‐5 softswitch products or similar).
 



 \\- Cloud‐native deployment of VoIP stacks (containerized Kamailio/FreeSWITCH clusters
 



 on AWS/GCP, Kubernetes, service meshes).
 



 \\- Prior work building call center or CPaaS‐style platforms, including programmable IVRs,
 



 queues, and analytics.
 



  





**Success Indicators:** 




 \\- A robust, observable VoIP backbone that can sustain high call volumes with low failure
 



 rates and predictable call quality across geographies.
 



 \\- Rapid rollout of new telephony features (IVRs, routing rules, AI agents) through clean
 



 APIs and configuration‐driven behavior rather than manual changes.
 



 \\- Demonstrated reduction in telephony incidents and MTTR through automation, strong
 



 monitoring, and clear runbooks.

 At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.
 



 To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.
 



 Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.
 



 While many roles at Coinbase are remote\\-first, we are not remote\\-only. In\\-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company\\-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.
 



 The mission of the Platform Product Group engineers is to build a trusted, scalable and compliant platform to operate with speed, efficiency and quality. Our teams build and maintain the platforms critical to the existence of Coinbase. There are many teams that make up this group which include Product Foundations (i.e. Identity, Payment, Risk, Proofing \\& Regulatory, Finhub), Machine Learning, Customer Experience, and Infrastructure.
 



 The Data Platform team builds and operates systems to centralize all of Coinbase's internal and third\\-party data, making it easy for teams across the company to access, process, and transform that data for analytics, machine learning, and powering end\\-user experiences.

**What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):** 



* Design, build, and operate our foundational data\\-heavy services: storage (cloud data warehouse, data lake), orchestration (Airflow), batch processing (Spark, SQL), streaming services (Kafka), query federation and caching, time\\-series db, graph db, and real\\-time event aggregation stores.
* Build and maintain data integration \\& process SDKs for use by internal services and product teams throughout Coinbase.
* Design and build self\\-service applications to empower our users to manage and troubleshoot their own data pipelines running on our platforms.
* Design and build services for end\\-to\\-end data security and data observability: managing access controls across multiple storage and access layers, tracking data quality, cataloging datasets and their lineage, usage auditing.
* Convert functional requests from data analysts, ML, and security \\& compliance into reusable and scalable patterns; and assemble data microservices into data platforms for critical business verticals and user cohorts.



**What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):** 



* You have at least 5\\+ years of experience in software engineering.
* You have Strong Python, Go, or Java backend development skills.
* You have general experience working with data systems or data pipelines.
* You are familiar with design patterns such as scale\\-out, caching, key/value, and columnar.
* You leverage SQL, Python, Airflow, and BI expertise to analyze data for operational insights.



**Nice to Have:** 



* Crypto\\-forward experience, including familiarity with onchain activity such as interacting with Ethereum addresses, using ENS, and engaging with dApps or blockchain\\-based services
