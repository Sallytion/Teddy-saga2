 We are seeking a high\\-impact Integration Engineer to own the end\\-to\\-end lifecycle of our data ecosystem. You will be the primary technical owner of our integration logic, responsible for building, modifying, and supporting the entire bridge between our data sources and our partners.
 



 Currently, our logic is housed in .NET and SAP CPI. As we migrate our data sources to Google Cloud (GCP), you will lead the evolution of these systems—translating evolving business requirements into high\\-security, cloud\\-native solutions that will eventually power our Agentic AI initiatives.
 



**Key Responsibilities** 



* Full\\-Lifecycle Development: Act as the primary developer for all integration requirements. You will build, test, and deploy changes to the business logic, ensuring data accuracy and system integrity.
* End\\-to\\-End Orchestration: Manage the complete ""Trigger\\-to\\-Delivery"" workflow. This includes maintaining the schedules (Cloud Scheduler), the logic/transformations, and the secure transport.
* Cloud Modernization: Lead the migration from legacy .NET scheduled tasks to GCP Application Integration and BigQuery\\-centric workflows.
* Confidential Data Security: Architect and support highly secure pipelines for PII data. You will implement PGP encryption, manage SSH keys via GCP Secret Manager, and ensure ""Privacy by Design.""
* Production Support \\& Reliability: Provide Tier\\-3 support for the integrations you build. You will monitor job success, troubleshoot failures, and ensure the reliability of daily/weekly scheduled transfers.
* Innovation: As the GCP foundation stabilizes, you will develop Autonomous AI Agents (Vertex AI) to interact with our data layers to automate complex business queries.



**Experience \\& Skill Set** 



* Enterprise Integration: Typically requires 5\\+ years of experience in enterprise data orchestration, or a demonstrated mastery of complex middleware environments.
* Legacy Proficiency: Deep experience in C\\# / .NET, Quartz.NET for job scheduling, EF Core for data persistence, and SAP Cloud Integration (CPI/CI) iflows, Groovy Scripting for complex data transformations.
* Cloud Native Fluency: Proven ability to build within the GCP ecosystem (BigQuery, Cloud Storage). Experience with low\\-code tools like GCP Application Integration is highly preferred.
* Security Expertise: Expert\\-level knowledge of PGP encryption, SFTP, SSH, and handling sensitive/confidential data within cloud environments.
* Ownership Mindset: Experience in a role that requires both ""Building"" (Development) and ""Running"" (Support/Maintenance).



 Why Join Us?
   

 This role offers a unique balance: the stability of maintaining a core enterprise engine and the creative freedom to architect for a new cloud\\-native future. You aren't just a coder; you are the architect of our data's journey.
