The Grid was left unfinished — fragments of a code base buried in the collapse. Whoever built it didn’t leave instructions, only proof that it could be rebuilt through action.
 



 The Open Grid Fellowship is a selective 12\\-week program for experienced full\\-stack and open source developers. It begins inside the PlayOps ARG: daily missions in Telegram, 30–60 minutes a day, XP receipts for every proof of action. By the second month, your contributions evolve into real system builds — open validators, prototypes, and templates that define how the Grid works.
 



 This is not a job. It’s authorship in a system that outlives résumés. XP is sweat equity. Your receipts today become your stake tomorrow.
 



 What You’ll Do
 


* Enter the daily rhythm: 30–60 min Telegram missions, proof submissions, XP multipliers.
* Transition into system building: sketches → prototypes → working validators.
* Collaborate globally with players, storytellers, and builders.
* Leave behind open source templates used worldwide.



 Who We’re Looking For
 



 This track is not entry\\-level. It’s for builders who already ship code and contribute in the open.
 


* Full\\-stack developers comfortable moving between front\\-end, back\\-end, and data.
* Open source contributors who understand authorship \\+ collaboration.
* Devs who can translate fragments into systems with minimal guidance.
* Problem\\-solvers who thrive in ambiguity and want to author infrastructure, not just features.



 Why Join
 


* Your builds are featured in a global documentary \\+ Roku episodic series.
* Your validators launch as open templates used worldwide.
* Every action is logged as a receipt of authorship.
* XP is sweat equity in the Grid — unlocking future token rewards.
* Build inside a living ARG where story and system are inseparable.



 Requirements
 


* Demonstrated experience in full\\-stack development (front\\-end \\+ back\\-end).
* Prior contributions to open source projects.
* Strong command of JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, and one major framework (React, Node, or equivalent).
* Must have Telegram \\+ LinkedIn accounts.
* Comfortable reading \\+ typing in English (all text\\-based).
* Commit 30–60 minutes daily for 12 weeks (remote \\+ global).



 Compensation
 



 This is a fellowship, not a salary role. You’ll leave with:
 


* Authorship in validators and open templates.
* A builder profile with XP, badges, and skill scores.
* Credit in the PlayOps documentary.
* XP receipts that unlock tokenized rewards later.

 Rapid Alpha is rethinking how businesses use AI. Where tools like ChatGPT and Claude are powerful but unreliable for serious business use, we built EVOS: a platform that gives companies curated, verifiable datasets, reusable prompts, and trusted AI workflows to make high\\-stakes decisions with confidence.
   

  

 Our long\\-term vision is for EVOS to become:
   

  

 The marketplace for curated datasets from domain experts.
   

 The marketplace for reusable prompts, workflows, and agents.
   

 The operating system for better product roadmaps and strategic growth.
   

 To make this vision a reality, we are hiring a Senior Full Stack Developer who wants to be at the center of building the next generation of AI\\-powered business infrastructure.
   

  

 Why This Role Matters
   

  

 General\\-purpose LLMs are closed, opaque, and untrustworthy for critical decisions. EVOS solves that problem by being open, traceable, and monetizable.
   

  

 As our Senior Full Stack Developer, you will:
   

  

 Build the foundation of the EVOS platform across front\\-end, backend, and integrations.
   

 Integrate AI\\-assisted development into our workflow, ensuring code written with AI tools is reliable and production\\-ready.
   

 Shape the system that supports a three\\-sided marketplace (datasets, prompts, workflows).
   

 Mentor and guide the team as we scale EVOS into a platform trusted by innovation leaders worldwide.
   

 This isn’t a “push tickets” role. It’s a chance to build the technical backbone of a platform designed to transform how companies trust and use data.
   

  

 What You’ll Do
   

  

 Full Stack Development
   

 Build user\\-facing features with Laravel Blade, Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, and JavaScript.
   

 Develop scalable backend services in Python (Flask), PostgreSQL, and AWS.
   

 Create seamless APIs that connect datasets, LLMs, and workflows.
   

 AI\\-Integrated Development
   

 Use AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, agents) to accelerate development.
   

 Refactor, validate, and optimize AI\\-generated code to production standards.
   

 Experiment with and adopt new AI coding practices into the team.
   

 Marketplace Enablement
   

 Build features that support dataset licensing, prompt reusability, and workflow marketplaces.
   

 Implement traceability and repeatability features so users know exactly where insights come from.
   

 Collaboration \\& Leadership
   

 Work closely with product managers, analysts, and data engineers to turn business needs into software.
   

 Mentor junior developers and hybrid QA/dev testers.
   

 Contribute to hiring and building the software team.
   

  

 What We’re Looking For
   

  

 Experience: 6–10 years in full stack development, with experience leading or mentoring.
   

 Front End: JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Laravel Blade.
   

 Back End: Python (Flask), PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs.
   

 Cloud/DevOps: AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, S3\\), Git/GitHub workflows.
   

 AI Readiness: Experience with AI coding tools; ability to validate AI\\-generated code.
   

 Mindset: Ownership, problem\\-solving, speed balanced with quality, entrepreneurial drive.
   

 Soft Skills: Clear English communication, ability to collaborate across technical and non\\-technical teams.
   

 Nice to Have
   

  

 Chrome Extension development.
   

 Data scraping / NLP experience.
   

 Exposure to patent\\-heavy or IP\\-centric software domains.
   

 Startup/consulting background.
   

 What We Offer
   

  

 100% Remote/Hybrid flexibility.
   

 Competitive salary \\+ performance incentives.
   

 An 11\\-month work year (company\\-wide mid\\-year \\+ end\\-of\\-year breaks).
   

 Indian Federal Holidays \\+ 5 personal days.
   

 The opportunity to build a platform redefining how businesses use AI for growth.
   

 This is not just a development job—it’s a chance to build the operating system for innovation.","Strategic Management Services","https://www.linkedin.com/company/rapidalpha","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQH14Wq20lLAvg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1654310913438/rapidalpha_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=TljLO6j9dDhyKOZ4dgYv-mNLHIZwi2Mn-T61jBFl2aY","","","","","","","","","","",""
