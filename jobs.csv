 In this role, you will work on
 **reinforcement learning, preference optimization, and long\\-horizon agent behavior,** 
 while helping
 **build realistic environments, datasets, and evaluation frameworks.** 
 Your work will directly shape how modern AI systems are trained, validated, and deployed in production settings.
 



  





 You’ll operate at the intersection of

**About the Team** 




  





 Huzzle works with frontier AI labs and enterprises to produce high\\-quality human data, evaluation frameworks, and realistic agent environments. Our work focuses on
 **long\\-horizon professional workflows**
