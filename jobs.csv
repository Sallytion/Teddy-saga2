 This is not CRUD SaaS.
 



  





 What you’ll build
 



 \\- Backend systems handling high volume, messy healthcare data
 



 \\- Stateful workflows where humans and agents interact
 



 \\- Systems that fail loudly, not silently
 



 \\- Production code that values correctness and observability
 



 \\- Tools that actually get used by real operators
 



  





 How we build
 



 \\- We use agentic coding tools daily
 



 \\- LLMs are co\\-developers, not autocomplete
 



 \\- Everyone builds with AI
 



 \\- No separate “AI engineer” role
 



  





 You’re a great fit if
 



 \\- You think in systems, not tickets
 



 \\- You’re strong in CS fundamentals
