They partner with ambitious businesses to transform sales, marketing, and customer success functions — combining strategy, systems, and advanced AI tooling to unlock growth.
 



  





 In under a year, they’ve achieved HubSpot Diamond Partner status — a testament to their sharp execution, problem\\-solving mindset, and relentless focus on the customer.
 



 The business is lean, collaborative, and fully remote — with a team spanning Australia and Asia\\-Pacific. No corporate red tape. No egos. Just curious, switched\\-on people who value ownership, outcomes, and making things better.
 



  





 If you’re passionate about technology, automation, and building smart technical solutions — and want to shape something meaningful from the inside — this is the role for you.
 



  





**The Role** 




 We're looking for a Senior Full\\-Stack Developer with a strategic mindset and proven problem\\-solving skills to join our team. This is a technical leadership role where you will be instrumental in building our technology pillar and helping grow the business. You will be able to get your hands dirty, working with the team to build good websites and solve complex integrations with other systems.
 



  





 You will work closely with our clients and act as a technical salesperson, presenting solutions and building products. You will have a team of developers under you to handle the day\\-to\\-day development, but you will also be hands\\-on with the tools, fixing issues and solving problems. This person will work on complex integrations, APIs, and help productise services.
 



  





**What You’ll Be Doing** 



* Acting as a technical lead, providing strategic solutioning and problem\\-solving for complex projects.
* Working directly with clients to understand their needs and present comprehensive technical solutions.
* Guiding our offshore development team in building websites with complex integrations and advanced functionalities.
* Developing and owning custom integrations and products, such as API integrations with ERP systems like NetSuite or Xero.
* Getting your hands dirty with the tools to troubleshoot and resolve issues.
* Supporting the growth of the technology pillar, which includes websites, custom integrations, and AI.



  





**What You Won’t Be Doing** 



* Low\\-Value Admin: We have a dedicated support team to handle repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on high\\-level technical builds and innovation.
* Rigid Playbooks: You'll adapt solutions to evolving client goals, tools, and ecosystems.
* Pure Management: You'll be a leader, but you will also be expected to be hands\\-on with the tools



  





**Goals for the First Year** 



* Within 3 Months: Deliver clean, scalable builds for new implementations and integrations, and begin to lead the offshore development team.
* Within 6 Months: Be a key contributor to complex technical projects, acting as a technical solutioning expert for the team and clients.
* By Year’s End: Have a firm grasp on the technology needs of the business, helping to productise our services and build new offerings for Scale Station.



  





**This Role is a Great Fit if You…** 



* Have 5\\-6\\+ years of solid technical experience as a full\\-stack developer.
* Have a strategic mindset and a passion for solving complex problems.
* Are comfortable with client\\-facing responsibilities and acting as a technical salesperson.
* Thrive in a remote\\-first, fast\\-paced environment where initiative and ownership are valued.



  





**This Won’t Be the Right Role if You…** 



* Lack a strategic or problem\\-solving mindset.
* Prefer a pure management role and are unwilling to be hands\\-on with the tools.
* Struggle with strong communication and working with a distributed team.
* Need step\\-by\\-step guidance rather than taking ownership of delivery.



  





**What We’re Looking For** 



* Proven experience building and customising complex technical solutions, particularly API integrations.
* The ability to analyse a problem and come up with a holistic solution.
* Strong communication skills, especially in a client\\-facing context.
* A product development mindset and experience building solutions that can be productised.
* Experience with a range of technical tools and the ability to get your hands dirty.



  





**Perks \\& Benefits** 



* Competitive base salary plus 5% commission on identified upsell opportunities.
* 100% remote, flexible hours — your productivity matters most.
* Opportunities to innovate in an AI\\-first, integration\\-led agency.
* Work on high\\-impact client projects and internal automation initiatives.
