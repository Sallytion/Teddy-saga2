**THE OPPORTUNITY** 




 We are seeking an experienced AI Engineer to join our growing team at ContractPodAi. In this role, you will design, develop, and deploy intelligent systems that power next\\-generation features in our contract lifecycle management (CLM) platform. You will work at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and agentic AI to create autonomous, goal\\-driven agents capable of reasoning, learning, and acting in dynamic environments.
 



 This is your opportunity to play a pivotal role in advancing the capabilities of legal tech with powerful agent\\-based systems built on the latest advancements in large language models, reinforcement learning, and autonomous AI frameworks.
 



  





**WHAT YOU WILL DO:** 



* Architect and implement scalable agentic AI systems that autonomously execute complex workflows and reason over legal data.
* Research, prototype, and productionize ML/DL models, especially in natural language processing and understanding (NLP/NLU).
* Build and deploy intelligent legal agents that can interpret documents, make decisions, and collaborate with users or other agents to complete multi\\-step tasks.
* Utilize modern frameworks and platforms (e.g., LangChain, LangGraph AutoGen, OpenAI Function Calling, Semantic Kernel) to build multi\\-agent workflows.
* Fine\\-tune and integrate large language models (LLMs) using PEFT, LoRA, and RAG techniques tailored to legal domain challenges.
* Design and implement robust infrastructure for managing AI lifecycle, including training, inference, monitoring, and continuous learning.
* Collaborate with legal experts, product managers, and engineering teams to create explainable and trustworthy AI systems.
* Contribute to the development of our AI strategy for agent\\-based automation within legal operations and contract management.

**WHAT YOU WILL NEED:** 



* 4\\+ Years of experience and a strong background in computer science, software engineering, or data science with a deep focus on machine learning and NLP.
* Demonstrated experience building or integrating agentic AI systems (e.g., AutoGPT\\-style agents, goal\\-oriented LLM pipelines, multi\\-agent frameworks).
* Proficiency in Python and ML/NLP libraries such as HuggingFace Transformers, LangChain, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Spacy.
* Experience developing and scaling ML models (including LSTMs, BERT, Transformers) for real\\-world applications.
* Understanding of LLM training (e.g., OpenAI, LLAMA, Falcon), embeddings, and prompt engineering.
* Hands\\-on experience with Reinforcement Learning (e.g., PPO, RLHF, RLAIF).
* Experience extracting text and semantic information from structured and unstructured documents (PDFs, Images, etc.).
* Comfort working in Agile/Scrum environments and collaborating across cross\\-functional teams.
* Passion for innovation in AI and a strong desire to build autonomous systems that solve complex, real\\-world problems.
