 Present in India since 1953, Thales is headquartered in Noida and has other operational offices and sites spread across Delhi, Gurugram, Bengaluru and Mumbai, among others. Over 2200 employees are working with Thales and its joint ventures in India. Since the beginning, Thales has been playing an essential role in India’s growth story by sharing its technologies and expertise in Defence, Aerospace and Cyber \\& Digital sectors.

**About The Product**
 Advanced Bot Protection defends mission\\-critical websites, mobile apps, and APIs from automated threats \\- bad bots \\- without affecting the flow of business\\-critical traffic.
   

  

 Bad bots are purpose\\-built to attack organizations’ websites and mobile apps through web scraping, account takeover, transaction fraud, denial of service, competitive data mining, unauthorized vulnerability scans, spam, click fraud, and web and mobile API abuse.
   

  

 A unique security concern, the bot problem is focused on abuse of business functionality rather than finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.

 We are a team of programmers based around Stockholm, responsible for developing real\\-time bot detection software, data processing pipelines, and customer\\-facing tools. Our team works according to modern development practices and our main language is Rust. We also have frontends, and browser/mobile SDKs for Android and iOS. We operate a global infrastructure and deploy daily, and we work closely with data scientists and cybersecurity threat researchers.
   

  

**About You**
 We are now looking for a person who wants to help us in strengthening our defences against bad bots. You have an analytical and creative mindset and can approach problems from new angles. Most likely, you enjoy exploring new technologies and use them to your advantage, rather than being heavily specialized in a few areas.

* Minimum of 5 years’ experience developing and delivering distributed systems
* Solid experience and understanding of mobile devices and SDKs
* Experience in Cloud environment, preferably AWS
* Strong experience and knowledge in JavaScript
