 Posting Statement
   

  

 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""

 At Strum AI, we’re reimagining the technology that powers global supply chains with an AI\\-first approach.
   

  

 Today, most supply chains still rely on Excel or legacy enterprise tools that take months—and millions of
   

  

 dollars—to implement. Our mission is to lower that barrier, making modern forecasting, inventory, and
   

  

 planning capabilities accessible in days, not months, for businesses of any size.
   

  

 As a founding engineer, you’ll work directly with the founders (former Amazon supply chain and
   

  

 technology leaders) to build the core product from the ground up—spanning LLMs, optimization,
   

  

 simulations, agent\\-driven workflows, and a reimagined product experience that tightly connects data,
   

  

 insights, and action. We are hiring a Lead Developer to be the technical backbone of Strum AI. This
   

  

 person will own system architecture end\\-to\\-end and lead the build\\-out of our backend platform, agent
   

  

 framework, and the interaction layer that brings decision intelligence into the flow of work. This is
   

  

 a hands\\-on, founding\\-level role. You will design the system, write critical code, influence product UX,

 modeling services, agent workflows, APIs, and UI integration
   

  

  Agentic Workflow Engine: Build the agent framework that powers simulations, decision support,
   

  

 and automated workflows; Design reusable action blocks (e.g., query forecast, run optimization,
   

  

 simulate scenarios, trigger downstream actions)
   

  

  Backend \\& APIs: Build production\\-grade backend services (Python\\-first); Develop APIs
   

  

 supporting probabilistic forecasts, inventory optimization, simulations, and what\\-if analysis
   

  

  Frontend \\& Product Interaction: Help reimagine the frontend by bringing Bring a strong
   

  

 product intuition to data\\-heavy, decision\\-intelligence workflows; while you don’t need to be a
   

  

 frontend specialist, you should be comfortable shipping meaningful UI code and shaping API–UI

  Data \\& Systems: Help define and evolve Strum’s canonical supply\\-chain data model; Build
   

  

 ingestion pipelines that handle messy enterprise data and schema drift
   

  

 What We’re Looking For
   

  

**Required**
  8\\+ years of professional software engineering experience
   

  

  Strong backend and systems design experience
   

  

  Production\\-grade Python expertise

 Lead Software Development Engineer, Strum AI
   

  

 At Strum AI, we’re reimagining the technology that powers global supply chains with an AI\\-first approach.
