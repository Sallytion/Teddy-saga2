 .**
**About Your Skills**
* Integration Architecture: You design resilient, scalable integrations across SaaS applications, internal services, and data platforms. You’re fluent in common integration patterns (event\\-driven, pub/sub, request/response, orchestration vs. choreography) and can choose the right one for the job.
* iPaaS Expertise: Hands\\-on with modern enterprise iPaaS platforms (e.g., Workato, MuleSoft, Boomi, SnapLogic). You build reusable components, error handling, retries/idempotency, and secure connections.
* Data Engineering: You build reliable ingestion pipelines into cloud data warehouses (e.g., Databricks, Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery). You’re comfortable with ELT/ETL, modeling, and transformation tools such as dbt, and have hands\\-on experience with connector\\-based ingestion platforms (e.g., Fivetran) and CDC patterns.
* Software Engineering: Proficient in at least one backend language (Python or Ruby preferred; Node.js/Java a plus) for custom connectors, microservices, and API work. You write tests and automate deployments.
* APIs \\& Webhooks: Strong knowledge of REST and GraphQL, schema/versioning practices, OAuth 2\\.0/OIDC/JWT, and webhook design/consumption.
* SQL Mastery: Advanced SQL, query optimization, performance tuning, and data quality validation.

**About This Role**
 As an Integration Engineer, you will design, build, and operate mission\\-critical integrations that connect business systems and data platforms. You’ll own the integration lifecycle end\\-to\\-end—from discovery and design through implementation, observability, and ongoing improvement—ensuring that data is accurate, timely, and secure. You’ll partner closely with business system owners, data engineering, security, and operations to deliver seamless cross\\-system workflows and trusted datasets.
   

  

****What you’ll be doing****
* Architect, implement, and maintain integrations using an enterprise iPaaS and APIs to connect SaaS platforms, internal services, and data platforms.
* Build and operate ingestion pipelines into cloud data warehouses; model and transform data (dbt preferred) and ensure data quality with automated tests and SLAs/SLOs.
* Leverage connector\\-driven ingestion platforms (e.g., Fivetran) to onboard sources, manage sync schedules, handle schema drift, and monitor load health.
* Develop reusable integration assets (templates, connectors, middleware, shared libraries); enforce standards for resiliency, idempotency, and observability.
* Implement and manage API\\-based and file\\-based exchanges (webhooks, REST/GraphQL, SFTP, object storage) with appropriate encryption and key rotation.
* Establish monitoring/alerting, dashboards, and runbooks; lead incident response, root\\-cause analysis, and continuous improvement for integration reliability.
* Collaborate with security and IT to manage identity, secrets, and access controls; ensure compliance with internal policies.
* Partner with stakeholders to translate business processes into scalable technical designs; run UAT and change management to drive adoption.
* Document architecture, data contracts, and operational procedures for long\\-term maintainability.


****What you’ll have****
* 5\\+ years building enterprise integrations across SaaS/business systems and data platforms (or 3\\+ years with demonstrated depth and impact).
* Direct experience with at least one sophisticated iPaaS (e.g., Workato, MuleSoft, Boomi, SnapLogic) and the ability to learn others quickly.
* Strong SQL; hands\\-on with one or more modern cloud data warehouses (Databricks, Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery) and ELT/ETL practices; experience with dbt preferred.
* Hands\\-on with Fivetran or a comparable managed ingestion/ELT platform) for source onboarding, scheduling, schema change handling, and monitoring.
* Experience with REST/GraphQL, OAuth 2\\.0/OIDC, webhook patterns, and API gateways/reverse proxies.
* Knowledge of secure file transfer (SFTP) and cloud object storage (S3 or equivalents), including lifecycle policies and cost\\-awareness.
* Comfort with orchestration and scheduling (e.g., Airflow, Dagster, or equivalent).
* DevOps skills: Git\\-based workflows and CI/CD; familiarity with Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) and containerization (e.g., Docker/Kubernetes) is a plus.
