We help our customers be more competitive by discovering interesting patterns in this data they can use to their advantage, while being uniquely positioned to be able to do this across both online and instore.
   

  

 We are looking for a lead\\-level software engineer to lead the charge on a team of like\\-minded individuals responsible for developing the data architecture that powers our data collection process and analytics platform.
