 • Lead AWS\\-heavy deployments (e.g., ECS/EKS or Lambda, S3, RDS, CloudFront, IAM) and IaC (Terraform/CloudFormation).
 



 • Productionize AI features: wire up transformer/NLP pipelines, embeddings, vector search, and model\\-serving endpoints.
 



 • Drive performance, security, and observability (tracing, metrics, structured logging, alerts).
 



 • Collaborate closely with product/ML to ship end\\-to\\-end features in fast iterations.
 



  





**Must\\-have qualifications** 




 • B.Tech in Computer Science (or related field). M.Tech/PhD is a plus.

 • AI fundamentals—especially transformers and NLP—and experience integrating models into products.
 



 • Evidence of rigor: Demonstrated depth in AI/ML or systems, shown through published research papers or equivalent large\\-scale industry projects.
 



  





**Nice to have** 




 • Model serving stacks (Hugging Face, vLLM/Triton), embeddings/vector DBs (pgvector, OpenSearch, Pinecone).
 



 • Eventing/streaming (Kafka/SQS), caching (Redis), queues/background workers (Celery/RQ).
 



 • CI/CD ownership, containerization (Docker), and Kubernetes.

 • Daily, in\\-person collaboration at our Hyderabad office.
 



  





**How we work** 




 • Pragmatic engineering: clear interfaces, clean code, strong tests.
 



 • Bias for action: you own problems end\\-to\\-end and move with startup speed.
 



 • Collaborative by default: pair with ML/product/legal experts to solve real user problems.
 



 • Onsite role (not remote/hybrid).
 



  





**Interview process (typical)**
