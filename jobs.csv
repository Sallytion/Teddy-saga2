 Blitzy is a Boston\\-based Generative AI startup on a mission to automate custom software creation to unlock the next industrial revolution. We're transforming how enterprises build software—turning human ideas into production\\-ready applications with AI that can autonomously generate up to 80% of enterprise\\-grade code.
   

  

 We're backed by tier 1 investors and led by founders with deep expertise in AI and enterprise software. Our platform doesn't just suggest code snippets—it builds complete, production\\-ready applications that enterprises can deploy immediately.
   

  

****U.S. GenAI startup, Bangalore Office****
**Build the bridge between cutting\\-edge AI and real\\-world software development**
****Employment Type:****
 Independent Contractor (6\\-month initial contract)
   

  

****Compensation:****
 ₹50 \\- 65 LPA (approximately $60,000 \\- $78,000 USD)

 The Role
   

  

 We're looking for a Forward Deployed Software Engineer who thrives at the intersection of cutting\\-edge AI technology and real\\-world enterprise software challenges. You'll embed directly with our enterprise customer's engineering team in Bangalore, helping them revolutionize their software development with Blitzy.
   

  

 This isn't a typical solutions engineer role. You'll write production code, architect solutions, and work shoulder\\-to\\-shoulder with customer engineering teams to deliver transformative outcomes. You're equally comfortable debugging a complex integration, participating in sprint planning, or whiteboarding architecture with a CTO.
   

  

****Work Arrangement:****
 This role requires being on\\-site with the customer 5 days per week in Bangalore. You'll become an embedded member of their engineering organization while representing Blitzy's technical expertise and platform capabilities. Close collaboration with Blitzy's US\\-based engineering team happens through daily standups and regular video sessions.
   

  

 What Success Looks Like
   

  

* You deploy Blitzy into complex enterprise environments, navigating technical constraints while delivering immediate value
* You write custom integrations and extensions that unlock new use cases for customers
* You translate ambitious business goals into concrete technical implementations using Blitzy's AI capabilities
* You identify patterns across customer needs that influence our product roadmap
* You become a trusted technical advisor to engineering leaders, earning their confidence through hands\\-on expertise

 What You'll Do
   

  

 Customer Partnership
   

  

* Embed with customer teams during critical implementations, serving as their technical co\\-pilot
* Participate in customer sprint planning, architecture reviews, and technical decision\\-making
* Build custom solutions that demonstrate Blitzy's capabilities in their specific environment


 Technical Implementation
   

  

* Write production\\-quality code to integrate Blitzy with existing enterprise systems
* Develop reusable patterns, scripts, and tools that accelerate customer adoption
* Debug complex issues spanning customer infrastructure and our platform

* Contribute to our technical documentation and best practices


**Required Experience**
* 4\\-10 years of software engineering experience with a track record of shipping production code
* Fluency in multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go, or C\\#)
* Deep understanding of modern software development practices (CI/CD, microservices, cloud architecture)
* Experience with enterprise development workflows, including Agile/Scrum methodologies
* Hands\\-on experience with Jira and enterprise software development lifecycle
* Proven ability to navigate complex technical environments and stakeholder relationships
* Strong communication skills in English—you can explain technical concepts to anyone from intern to CTO
* Must be based in or willing to relocate to Bangalore, India for this full\\-time on\\-site role


 What Makes You Stand Out
   

  

* Experience at high\\-growth startups or in customer\\-facing engineering roles
* Background in AI/ML, developer tools, or enterprise modernization projects
* Track record of technical thought leadership (blogs, talks, open source contributions)
* Experience with legacy system modernization or large\\-scale migrations
* Passion for the future of AI\\-powered software development
* Previous experience working with US\\-headquartered companies or in multicultural teams


 What Makes This Role Different
   

  

 Unlike traditional FDSE roles that focus on configuration and support, you'll be:
   

  

* Writing production code that directly impacts customer success
* Shaping AI adoption at the frontier of what's possible with generative AI
* Influencing product direction through direct field experience
* Working with our AI platform that generates complete applications, not just code snippets
* Growing with flexibility to transition into core product/platform engineering


 Contractor Terms
   

  

* Contract Duration: 6\\-month initial term with potential for extension based on project needs and performance
* Payment Structure: Monthly invoicing for services rendered
* Equipment: You provide your own equipment (laptop, monitors, accessories)
* Work Schedule: Monday\\-Friday, full\\-time on\\-site with customer in Bangalore
* As an independent contractor: You are responsible for your own taxes, insurance, and benefits


 Our Culture
   

  

 We move
 ****Blitzy Fast****
 —making swift decisions and shipping solutions that matter. We maintain a
 ****Championship Mindset****
 , operating like a professional team where everyone contributes to winning. We believe in being
