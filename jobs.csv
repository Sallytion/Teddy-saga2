**About Athenahealth**
**Here’s our vision:** 
 To create a thriving ecosystem that delivers accessible, high\\-quality, and sustainable healthcare for all.
   

  

**What’s unique about our locations?**
 From an historic, 19th century arsenal to a converted, landmark power plant, all of athenahealth’s offices were carefully chosen to represent our innovative spirit and promote the most positive and productive work environment for our teams. Our 10 offices across the United States and India — plus numerous remote employees — all work to modernize the healthcare experience, together.
   

  

**Our Company Culture Might Be Our Best Feature.**
 We don't take ourselves too seriously. But our work? That’s another story. athenahealth develops and implements products and services that support US healthcare: It’s our chance to create healthier futures for ourselves, for our family and friends, for everyone.
   

  

 Our vibrant and talented employees — or athenistas, as we call ourselves — spark the innovation and passion needed to accomplish our goal. We continue to expand our workforce with amazing people who bring diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives at every level, and foster an environment where every athenista feels comfortable bringing their best selves to work.
   

  

 Our size makes a difference, too: We are small enough that your individual contributions will stand out — but large enough to grow your career with our resources and established business stability.
   

  

 Giving back is integral to our culture. Our athenaGives platform strives to support food security, expand access to high\\-quality healthcare for all, and support STEM education to develop providers and technologists who will provide access to high\\-quality healthcare for all in the future. As part of the evolution of athenahealth’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, we’ve selected nonprofit partners that align with our purpose and let us foster long\\-term partnerships for charitable giving, employee volunteerism, insight sharing, collaboration, and cross\\-team engagement.

 Our systems operate at
 **exabyte scale** 
 , processing
 **petabytes of data each day** 
 for some of the world’s most prominent enterprises in finance, technology, and industry. These systems are already making a measurable difference in how global organizations use data to deploy AI safely and efficiently.
   

  

 We believe that the next generation of enterprise AI will not come from larger models but from
 **more efficient data systems** 
 . By advancing the frontier of how data is represented, stored, and transformed, we aim to make large\\-scale intelligence creation sustainable and adaptive.
   

  

 Our long\\-term vision is
 ***Efficient Intelligence***
 : AI that learns using fewer resources, generalizes from less data, and reasons through structure rather than scale. To reach that, we are first building the
 **Foundational Data Systems** 
 that make structured AI possible.
   

  

**Snapshot**
 As a
 **Staff Infrastructure Software Engineer** 
 , you will define and lead the architecture of Granica’s core infrastructure layer. This role owns
 **platform direction**

 You will operate as a
 **technical leader** 
 : setting standards, designing long\\-lived systems, and mentoring senior engineers while staying hands\\-on.
   

  

**The Mission**
 AI today is limited not only by model design but by the inefficiency of the data that feeds it. At scale, each redundant byte, each poorly organized dataset, and each inefficient data path slows progress and compounds into enormous cost, latency, and energy waste.
   

  

 Granica’s mission is to remove that inefficiency. We combine new research in
 **information theory** 
 ,
 **probabilistic modeling** 
 , and
 **distributed systems** 
 to design self\\-optimizing data infrastructure: systems that continuously improve how information is represented and used by AI.
   

  

 This engineering team partners closely with the Granica Research group led by
 **Prof. Andrea Montanari** 
 (Stanford), bridging advances in information theory and learning efficiency with large\\-scale distributed systems. Together, we share a conviction that the next leap in AI will come from breakthroughs in efficient systems, not just larger models.

* Improve observability, alerting, and operational clarity


**Cross\\-Team Collaboration**

 IgniteTech is dismantling that framework. We replace manual workflows with self\\-optimizing, AI\\-driven systems that operate at 10x the scale and velocity.

**Basic Requirements**

* A minimum of 5 years of full\\-stack software engineering experience (both front\\-end and back\\-end coding proficiency required)
* Hands\\-on experience embedding AI/LLMs (through APIs, prompt engineering, or automation workflows) into production applications
* Command of cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and experience designing scalable, distributed architectures
