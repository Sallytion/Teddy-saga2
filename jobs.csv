 Within the Consumer Authentication Business Unit, the Partner Services team helps to grow and expand our business by designing, building and supporting integrations between HID Consumer Authentication Products and third\\-party strategic ecosystems (Technology Partners).
   

  

 The integration components are designed so that the integrations are repeatable, add value, simplify/obfuscate complex technology, and importantly reduce the time and effort required of the partner to realise the value of their customers’ investments in both HID and the Technology Partner.
   

  

 To provide our customers and partners with the best possible service, it is imperative that Partner Services aligns closely with our technology partners, understands their business model \\& vision and defines a shared strategy for joint collaboration in conjunction with the technology partner. In collaboration with sales, solution marketing, product and technical pre\\-sales teams; Partner Services are responsible for identifying and engaging with new technology partners to increase HID Global’s addressable market share. Partner Services will serve as a conduit between the BU \\& partners to influence the strategic technology direction to help shape the BU portfolio vision \\& strategy.
   

  

 It should be noted that Technology Partners often have their own partner program or ecosystem (referred to as Integration Partners). The Integration Partners are involved in all phases of the end customer sales cycle, this could be from the specification of the solution, the customisation of the solution to meet customer\\-specific requirements, implementation and configuration of the solution, integration with third\\-party vendors and the support of the end to end solution thereafter. It is therefore also the responsibility of the Partner Services team to enable strategic Integration Partners.
   

  

 Integration Partners are already experts on the solution provided by the technology partner but may lack the direct knowledge and skills on the HID Consumer Auth portfolio. The Partner Services team are responsible for:
   

  

* Onboarding, Training and enabling Strategic Integration Partners
+ Educating strategic Integration Partners on HID Products along with the integration components developed by the team
+ Assisting strategic Integration Partners and HID Professional Services with the installation, configuration, and support of the integration components
+ Documenting and Testing integrations to ensure that they function as required
+ Gathering feedback from strategic integration partners on the integration components and other HID Products and passing this to the relevant teams for action
+ Supporting the strategic integration partners and technical services teams with critical customer issues
+ Ensure alignment with a partner by defining successful outcomes/measures for engagements.


  

  

* Enabling HID Authentication Bussiness Unit
+ Educating HID Technical teams on the integration components develop by partner services
+ Assisting HID Professional Services with the installation, configuration, and support of the integration components
+ Implementing troubleshooting tools and processes to aid in the troubleshooting process by third parties
+ Assisting in the pre\\-sales cycle as required
+ Focus on integrating our Crescendo series smartcards and tokens into authentication solutions.

 If you're ready to make an impact and grow your career, Legion is where you belong. Join us in making hourly work rewarding and fulfilling.
   

  

**BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY**
 There are almost 75 million hourly workers in the United States, representing more than half of the entire workforce. Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees. The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig\\-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options. Legion's mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by Legion's Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously.
   

  

 Legion WFM was built for the cloud with AI at the core and is designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses and meet the needs of today's hourly employees. Our team is composed of dedicated individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, globally distributed across all time zones.
