 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

 We're a high\\-growth Australian startup looking for our first engineers in India. You'll work directly with the founders, ship features that enterprise customers use within weeks, and have real ownership over how the product and engineering culture evolve. We move fast, ship often, and believe every engineer should be learning something new every week. If you want to learn fast, build things that matter, and grow with a company rather than just work at one, keep reading.
 



**What we're building:** 
 Ever noticed a ""Buy 2 Get 1 Free"" deal at a supermarket? Behind that simple sticker is a surprisingly complex data problem. Brands like Coca\\-Cola and Nestlé manage thousands of promotions across hundreds of retailers, each with different formats, rules, and deadlines — and most of it still runs on spreadsheets. We're replacing that with software.
 



 Promosync is an ETL pipeline for the real\\-world retail economy. We ingest promotional data from enterprise ERP systems (SAP, Oracle), transform it, validate it against retailer\\-specific schemas, and deliver it automatically. When our system works, promotions go live on time across thousands of stores. When it breaks, shelves have the wrong prices on millions of products. The stakes are real, and the problems are genuinely interesting.
 



  




 What You'll Actually Do
 
 You won't be fixing bugs on a legacy codebase or writing boilerplate CRUD endpoints. You'll be building core product features that real users depend on every day. In your first few months, you might:
 


* Build new data transformation pipelines that convert promotional plans from ERP formats into retailer\\-specific templates
* Design and implement API endpoints in NestJS that handle complex business logic around promotional hierarchies and discount structures
* Create interactive data visualisation components in Next.js that help users understand and validate their promotional plans before submission
* Write Terraform modules to provision and manage AWS infrastructure as we scale
* Work directly with our customers (major FMCG brands) to understand their workflows and translate needs into technical solutions
* Contribute to architectural decisions — with a team this small, every engineer shapes how the system evolves


 Our Tech Stack
 * **Frontend:** 
 Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** 
 NestJS with TypeScript
* **Database:** 
 PostgreSQL
* **Infrastructure:** 
 AWS (ECS Fargate, RDS, S3, CloudFront), managed with Terraform
* **Tools:** 
 GitHub, Linear, Slack, Notion



*You don't need experience with all of these. If you're strong in JavaScript/TypeScript and learn quickly, you'll pick up the rest.* 



 What We're Looking For
 
 You'll thrive here if you:
 


* Have a solid foundation in JavaScript or TypeScript (through work, college projects, or self\\-learning)
* Understand how web applications work — HTTP requests, REST APIs, how a frontend talks to a backend, how data gets stored and retrieved
* Have strong problem\\-solving skills — you can break down complex problems, think through edge cases, and reason about data structures and algorithms
* Are comfortable with Git and collaborative development (pull requests, code reviews)
* Can communicate well
* Enjoy solving problems end\\-to\\-end rather than working in a narrow silo
* Are curious and self\\-driven, you look things up, read docs, experiment, and ask good questions when stuck


 Bonus (Not Required)
 * Experience with React, Next.js, or any modern frontend framework
* Exposure to NestJS, Express, or backend Node.js development
* Familiarity with PostgreSQL or relational database concepts
* Any experience with AWS, Docker, or infrastructure tooling
* Strong competitive programming or DSA profile (LeetCode, Codeforces, or similar)
* Open\\-source contributions, a technical blog, or side projects you're proud of


 What We Offer
 * **Direct impact:** 
 You'll work directly with founders and see your code used by enterprise customers within weeks, not months
* **Growth:** 
 As we grow, you grow. Early engineers shape the team culture, technical standards, and product direction
* **International exposure:** 
 Work with an Australian team serving global FMCG brands. Exposure to enterprise B2B product development


 How We Work
 
 We're a small team that values clarity over process. We move fast and ship frequently, but never at the cost of quality. You'll learn industry best practices in code review, testing, CI/CD, and security\\-first development. We're ISO 27001 and SOC 2 compliant, which means you'll pick up security engineering habits that most developers don't encounter until much later in their careers. Every PR is a learning opportunity, and we invest time in doing things right rather than just doing things quickly. We don't do arbitrary deadlines or crunch. We plan carefully, build incrementally, and trust each other to manage our time.
 


 How to Apply
 
 Send us your resume and a short note (2–3 sentences is fine) about a project or piece of code you're proud of and why. No formal cover letter needed.
 


* **Our process:** 
 Application review (2–3 days) → Short take\\-home task (2–3 hours) → Video conversation with the team (45–60 min) → Offer. We aim to complete this within 2 weeks.","Software Development","https://au.linkedin.com/company/promosyncai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEhLA3sNPeo7w/company-logo_100_100/B56ZniEzsHKMAQ-/0/1760434536484/promosyncai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=_ZnlFiOEjU7zJUjSW4mBA-HP1J8K8TJ94wMhFr7ZYGY","","","","","","","","","","",""

**Portkey is Looking for:******
**Job Description:**
**Software Developer \\- Backend (US Shift)**
**About The Role**
 Portkey is building the control plane for production AI systems used by fast\\-growing enterprises. As our customers run mission\\-critical AI workloads, real\\-time support and technical ownership during US business hours is essential. This role sits at the intersection of backend engineering and customer\\-facing problem solving. Youʼll be the first line of defense when things break, slow down, or behave unexpectedly — and youʼll fix issues at the code and system level, not just escalate tickets. If you enjoy debugging real production systems, learning distributed systems hands\\-on, and working closely with customers early in your career, this role is designed for you. Note: This role requires working night shifts aligned with US time zones.
   

  

**What Youʼll Do**
* Backend Engineering (Core Expectation)
+ Fix bugs and implement improvements in backend services based on production learnings.
+ Write clean, reliable code for APIs, services, and internal tooling.
+ Improve observability: logs, metrics, alerts, and dashboards.
+ Help automate repetitive support workflows and reduce on\\-call load over time.
+ Partner with senior engineers to ship reliability, performance, and DX improvements.

* Customer \\& Production Support
+ Support enterprise customers during US business hours (night shift IST).
+ Investigate and resolve production issues across APIs, backend services, and infrastructure.
+ Debug latency, failures, misconfigurations, and usage issues in live AI traffic.
+ Work directly with customers (Slack, tickets, calls) to understand problems and provide clear technical explanations.
+ Create runbooks, incident reports, and internal documentation from real incidents.


**What Weʼre Looking For**
* Technical Fundamentals (Must\\-Have)
+ 0\\-2 years of backend engineering experience (internships count).
+ Strong foundations in:
- Data structures \\& algorithms
- HTTP APIs and backend services
- One backend language (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, etc.)

+ Comfortable reading and debugging existing codebases.
+ Basic understanding of:
- Databases (SQL / NoSQL)
- APIs, auth, error handling
- Logs and basic monitoring

* Mindset \\& Role Fit (Equally Important)
+ Comfortable working night shifts consistently.
+ Curious, patient, and calm under pressure.
+ Enjoys debugging ambiguous issues with incomplete information.
+ Clear written and verbal communicator with customers.
+ Takes ownership — doesnʼt stop at “I reported it.”
+ Excited to learn how real systems behave in production.

* Nice to Have
+ Exposure to cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure).
+ Familiarity with observability tools (Datadog, Grafana, OpenTelemetry).
+ Any experience supporting production systems or customer\\-facing tools.
+ Interest in AI, LLMs, or developer infrastructure.


**What This Role Is (and Isnʼt)**
* This role is:
+ A hands\\-on way to learn production backend systems fast.
+ Customer\\-facing, but deeply technical.
+ A strong foundation for growing into backend, infra, or platform roles.

* This role is not:
+ A call\\-center or script\\-based support role.
+ Limited to ticket routing or escalation.
+ A purely feature\\-development role (at least initially).


**Growth Path**
* High performers in this role can grow into:
+ Backend Engineer (feature ownership)
+ Reliability / Platform Engineering
+ Customer Engineering / Solutions roles

* Your production exposure here will be hard to replicate elsewhere.


**Why Join Portkey**
* Work on real AI infrastructure used by enterprises in production.
* Learn distributed systems by operating them, not just reading about them.
* High ownership, high learning velocity.
* Direct access to senior engineers and founders.
* Early\\-stage company where your work visibly matters.


**How to apply for this opportunity?**
* Step 1: Click On Apply! And Register or Login on our portal.
* Step 2: Complete the Screening Form \\& Upload updated Resume
* Step 3: Increase your chances to get shortlisted \\& meet the client for the Interview!


**About Uplers:**
 Our goal is to make hiring reliable, simple, and fast. Our role will be to help all our talents find and apply for relevant contractual onsite opportunities and progress in their career. We will support any grievances or challenges you may face during the engagement.
   

  

 (Note: There are many more opportunities apart from this on the portal. Depending on the assessments you clear, you can apply for them as well).
