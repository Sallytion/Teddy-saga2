**The Mission**
 We are democratizing Data and AI for every enterprise user. Our vision is a world where anyone can master their organization’s data through Apps and AI Agents. We are building the retrieval backbone for two worlds: the high\\-precision context layer for AI agents and the intuitive search experience for people goal is the same: instant, accurate, and actionable insight.
   

  

**The Role**
* As a Search Quality Engineer, you sit at the heart of this transformation. You aren't just building a search engine; you are building the contextual backbone of the entire company.
* You will own the quality of results for two distinct but deeply connected ""users"":
* The AI Agent: Optimizing the retrieval layer that allows LLMs to reason over data they weren’t trained on, ensuring they have the ""ground truth"" needed to synthesize accurate, high\\-stakes business actions.
* The Human User: Improving the traditional search experience so employees can find assets and answers through intuitive, high\\-recall interfaces.


**The Technical Challenge**
 This isn't a solved problem. You will be tackling ""Search"" in its most evolved form:
   

  

* Hybrid Retrieval: Balancing traditional keyword\\-based search (for exactness) with semantic vector search (for intent).
* Dual\\-Optimization: Fine\\-tuning ranking models that satisfy both human readability and LLM\\-ready context.
* High\\-Stakes Accuracy: In a world of Agents, poor search quality leads to hallucinations. You will build the guardrails and relevance scoring that ensure our AI stays grounded in reality.
* Data Heterogeneity: Connecting the dots across structured SQL tables, unstructured docs, and real\\-time business metrics.


**Why This is the Place to Be**
* You will have a front\\-row seat to the Agentic revolution. If you want to solve the hardest problems in data discovery and see your work power the decision\\-making of thousands of people, let’s talk.


**What We’re Looking For**
* The IR Specialist: You know your way around Lucene/Elasticsearch, embeddings, and ranking algorithms.
* The Quality and Metrics Obsessive: You understand that ""relevance"" is subjective and love building evaluation frameworks (human\\-in\\-the\\-loop and LLM\\-based) to measure it. You are obsessed with relevance metrics (nDCG, MRR, Precision@K).
* The Bridge Builder: You’re excited to apply traditional Information Retrieval (IR) wisdom to the cutting\\-edge world of Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG).
