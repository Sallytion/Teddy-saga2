 SwayamWhere is a new\\-age Indian matrimony platform built for modern, values\\-driven singles
 **and** 
 their families.
 



 Think: safety, verified profiles, real compatibility, zero cringe.
 



 We’re building a product that feels like a premium consumer app, not a typical shaadi website. Clean UX, thoughtful flows, and a strong focus on trust, women’s safety, and families being part of the journey.
 



 We’re now hiring a
 **mid\\-level Frontend Developer (React)** 
 to help us ship a beautiful, fast, and reliable product as we scale across India.
 



  




 Role Overview
 
 As a Frontend Developer at SwayamWhere, you will:
 


* Own end\\-to\\-end implementation of core user\\-facing features in
 **React**
* Work closely with design \\+ product to turn Figma screens into smooth, production\\-ready UI
* Ensure our app looks and feels great across devices, with strong performance and accessibility
* Contribute to our design system, reusable components, and frontend architecture



 This is a
 **mid\\-level role (typically 2–4 years of experience)** 
 where you’ll have real ownership, not just pixel\\-pushing tickets.
 



  




 Key Responsibilities
 * Build and maintain
 **responsive, reusable React components** 
 for our web app
* Translate Figma designs into clean, modular, production\\-grade UI
* Integrate with REST/GraphQL APIs and work with backend engineers on contracts \\& data flows

* Optimize for performance: lazy loading, code splitting, minimizing bundle size, etc.
* Write maintainable code with proper typing, testing, and documentation
* Collaborate with product, design, and founders to refine UX and deliver smooth user journeys
* Own features from concept → implementation → tracking → iteration
* Fix bugs, improve reliability, and take part in regular code reviews



  




 Must\\-Have Qualifications
 * **2–4 years** 
 of professional experience as a Frontend / React Developer
* Strong hands\\-on experience with:
* **React** 
 (functional components, hooks, modern patterns)
* **JavaScript (ES6\\+)** 
 – TypeScript experience is a big plus
* HTML5, CSS3, responsive layouts, Flexbox/Grid
* Experience with at least one modern build setup:
 **Vite / CRA / Next.js / similar**
* Comfort working with
 **REST APIs** 
 (or GraphQL) and handling async data flows
* Strong understanding of
 **component\\-based architecture** 
 , state management, and routing
* Familiarity with Git, basic CI/CD workflows, and collaborative development
* Attention to detail for UI/UX and a sense of what “good” looks and feels like
* Clear communication, ownership mindset, and willingness to work in a fast\\-moving early\\-stage startup



  




 Nice\\-to\\-Have (Bonus)
 * Experience with
 **TypeScript**
* Experience with
 **TailwindCSS / styled\\-components / CSS\\-in\\-JS**
* Worked on a consumer\\-facing product (B2C) with high traffic or high UX expectations
* Experience with performance profiling and Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals
* Basic knowledge of accessibility best practices (a11y)
* Interest in the
 **Indian matchmaking / social / community apps** 
 ecosystem



  




 What We Offer
 * Opportunity to build a
 **flagship consumer product** 
 from an early stage
* High ownership: you’ll directly shape the UX that thousands of users interact with
* Collaborative, product\\-first culture – you’ll work closely with the founder \\& core team
* Flexible working:
 **remote\\-friendly** 
 , with optional in\\-person jams in Delhi\\-NCR
* Competitive salary;
 **ESOPs for the right long\\-term fit**
* Freedom to experiment, propose ideas, and ship fast



  




 Who You Are
 * You care about
 **clean code** 
*and* 
**delightful UX**
* You enjoy taking vague product ideas and turning them into polished experiences
* You’re comfortable in a startup environment: ambiguity, ownership, fast iterations
* You like building products that actually make people’s lives better, not just dashboards","Internet Publishing","https://in.linkedin.com/company/swayamwhere","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFiSn6cshRF2Q/company-logo_100_100/B4EZokOUkuGUAQ-/0/1761544328789?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ZCxPJfBQIGu6KzBwjBxiiz0GuuI8nY_skA98_J0JnZI","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Posting Statement
   

  

 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""

 At Google, our philosophy is build it, break it and then rebuild it better. That thinking is at the core of how we approach testing at Google. Unlike roles with similar names at the other companies, Test Engineers at Google aren't manual testers \\-\\- you write scripts to automate testing and create tools so developers can test their own code. As a Test Engineer, you navigate Google's massive codebase, identify weak spots and constantly design better and creative ways to break software and identify potential problems. You'll have a huge impact on the quality of Google's growing suite of products and services. Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our team combines the best of Google AI, Software, and Hardware to create radically helpful experiences. We research, design, and develop new technologies and hardware to make computing faster, seamless, and more powerful. We aim to make people's lives better through technology.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Create and implement test strategies by working with development teams to identify risk areas and fill the testing gaps.
* Drive test automate using existing test frameworks and work with the Engineering Productivity team to enhance and develop new test frameworks based on test requirements.
* Engrain product and engineering excellence as a core value in test engineering and our associated development partners.
