 Fuel customer growth through meaningful, intelligent, and safe user\\-to\\-user (and now, user\\-to\\-agent) engagement.
   

  

**CometChat Overview**
 CometChat is a full\\-stack conversational platform built to unify every layer of interaction — bringing together real\\-time conversations (chat, messaging, voice, and video), AI Agents, moderation, notifications, and analytics in one modular, developer\\-first solution.
   

  

 Our company has seen rapid growth, thanks to several market validations — including our participation in Techstars Boulder Accelerator in 2019, followed by investments from experienced investors such as iSeed Ventures, Range Ventures, Silicon Badia, and Matchstick Ventures. CometChat raised a Series A round from Signal Peak Ventures, bringing our total funding to $16M.
   

  

 We believe the interface of the future is conversation — not clicks. Every app will soon have an AI layer that’s as native as text messaging today. That’s why we’re building the infrastructure for the world’s AI\\-powered conversations — from human\\-to\\-human, to human\\-to\\-agent, to multi\\-party collaboration with AI in the mix.
   

  

 From AI onboarding assistants that get users productive in minutes, to copilots that perform complex workflows in\\-app, to intelligent moderators that protect and guide communities in real time — our AI Agent platform makes it all possible.
   

  

 With CometChat’s ready\\-to\\-use UI kits, powerful SDKs, and our Full Stack AI Agent Platform, product teams across startups and enterprises can launch safe, scalable, and smart in\\-app interactions faster than ever.
   

  

**CometChat’s Products**
**Real\\-Time Conversations Platform** 
 – 1:1, group, and broadcast messaging plus voice \\& video calling — with rich media, pre\\-built UI kits, SDKs, APIs, and enterprise\\-grade moderation hooks.
   

  

**Full Stack AI Agent Platform** 
 – Build, connect, and launch conversational AI agents, copilots, and chatbots with agent\\-ready UI, intelligent guardrails, workflow orchestration, RAG support, and deep analytics. Whether customers bring their own agent or use ours, we enable safe, contextual, and engaging interactions across web and mobile.
   

  

**Shared Services** 
 :
   

  

* Moderation Engine – Context\\-aware, multilingual, and media moderation with automated fallback handling.
* Notifications Engine – Smart delivery across Push, Email, SMS with personalization rules.
* Analytics \\& Insights – From message engagement to agent performance metrics.


**Where We Make an Impact**
* Our AI\\-powered solutions transform engagement across industries:
* Social Communities – AI Agents that foster inclusion, safety, and vibrancy.
* Marketplaces – Conversational shopping assistants and fraud prevention baked in.
* Events – Large\\-scale moderation that keeps interactions smooth for thousands.
* Telemedicine – AI triage and privacy\\-safe patient\\-provider communication.
* Dating Apps – Smart conversation starters and scam prevention for better matches.
* SaaS – In\\-app copilots that perform both front\\-end and back\\-end actions.
* Fintech – Compliance\\-ready messaging with automated risk checks.
* Education \\& eLearning – Instant tutoring, safe peer interaction, and Q\\&A via AI.
* Gaming – Real\\-time in\\-game companions, hints, and engagement prompts.


**Why Join Us Now**
 We’re at the tipping point where AI becomes a native part of every conversation. At CometChat, you’ll help shape a future where users can talk to their apps as naturally as to a friend — where agents think, reason, act, and collaborate with humans in real time.
   

  

 You won’t just be joining a product team — you’ll be building the standard for AI interaction layers: agent\\-aware UI, intelligent guardrails, rich actions libraries, and multi\\-party collaboration between people and AI.
   

  

 If you want to help define how the next billion users will communicate — and push the boundaries of what’s possible in real\\-time, AI\\-powered engagement — we’d love to work with you.
   

  

**Join us to build where AI meets human connection.**

When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors, significantly accelerating human progress. Our platform unites teams and organizations, breaking down barriers and redefining what's possible in software development.

Co\\-create the future with us as we build technology that transforms how the world develops software.
   

  

**An Overview Of This Role**
 Group Tenant Scale (GTS) is re\\-architecting GitLab.com into a modern, distributed SaaS platform. Today, GitLab.com runs as a single massive multi\\-tenant instance. Tomorrow, it will be made up of Cells (self\\-contained clusters) and Organizations (logical groupings of tenants), supported by OrgMover (seamless migration tooling).
   

  

 This transformation will make GitLab.com horizontally scalable, resilient, and flexible—so customers of every size experience high reliability, global reach, and freedom to grow with GitLab.
   

  

 As a Principal Engineer, you’ll shape the technical foundation of GitLab’s future SaaS. You’ll drive the design of distributed systems at scale, influence architectural strategy across engineering, and partner with leaders to align infrastructure with business outcomes. This is career\\-defining work that impacts every GitLab customer.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Lead architecture and design for Cells, Organizations and OrgMover, enabling Postgres sharding, zero\\-downtime migrations, and global SaaS scalability and regionality.
* Solve complex distributed systems challenges: tenant isolation, regional distribution, multi\\-region replication, observability, fault tolerance, and migrations.
* Partner across infrastructure, product, and executive teams to ensure our SaaS evolution aligns with both technical excellence and business needs.
* Translate architectural tradeoffs into clear direction for engineering managers, senior engineers, and executives.
* Mentor and elevate engineers across teams, raising the bar for technical leadership and inclusive collaboration.
* Provide thought leadership inside and outside GitLab on SaaS scaling, distributed systems, and platform reliability.


**What You’ll Bring**
* Extensive experience designing, developing, migrating, scaling, and operating large distributed systems in a SaaS context.
* Hands\\-on programming experience in Ruby and/or Go, with the ability to dive into code, review implementations, and guide technical design.
* Proven track record leading transformations from monolithic to distributed architectures, ideally including Postgres sharding or other database partitioning strategies.
* Hands\\-on expertise with service communication and observability at scale (e.g. service mesh/Istio, Kafka, tracing/metrics).
* Principal\\-level technical leadership: ability to set strategy, influence across organizations, and mentor principal and senior engineers.
* Balance of infrastructure depth and application architecture awareness; skilled at making system\\-level tradeoffs that prioritize reliability and customer experience.
* Excellent communication skills; able to make complex systems understandable to technical and non\\-technical audiences.
* Bonus: Experience in regulated or high\\-reliability domains (finance, healthcare, government, telecom).


**About The Team**
 Group Tenant Scale (GTS) is re\\-architecting GitLab.com into the next\\-generation multi\\-tenant SaaS platform. It will be horizontally scalable, reliable, and flexible. We are building this through Cells (infrastructure\\-level sharding), Organizations (application\\-level tenant grouping), and extensions of Geo to enable replication and cross\\-platform migrations.
   

  

 Our goal is to give every customer a rock\\-solid experience: high availability, strong resiliency, global performance, and the ability to move seamlessly between multi\\-tenant and single\\-tenant offerings as their needs evolve.
   

  

 What began as a small team tackling foundational projects has grown into dedicated engineering groups, including Geo, that are working together to deliver the future of GitLab’s multi\\-tenant platform.
   

  

 As part of this team, you will be at the center of one of the most impactful transformations in GitLab’s history. You will help reshape GitLab.com into a cloud\\-scale SaaS platform that powers the next decade of growth, while collaborating with some of the best engineers in distributed systems, mentoring others, and leaving a lasting architectural legacy.
