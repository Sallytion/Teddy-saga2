Een ziekenhuis waar de patiënt in het streven naar de beste zorg centraal staat en zeer veel aandacht aan kwalitatief hoogstaande geneeskunde wordt besteed.
   

  

 Als vernieuwend ziekenhuis investeren we in een stimulerende werkomgeving en teamwerk. We reiken volop kansen aan voor persoonlijke en professionele groei, met de focus op continue ontwikkeling en opleiding.
   

  

 Kom jij ons op IT versterken?
   

  

 IT in het ziekenhuis: onzichtbaar én onmisbaar. IT en technologie spelen een cruciale rol in de werking van ons ziekenhuis. Van het toekennen van toegangsrechten via SmartAIM tot het digitaliseren van het Operatiekwartier, IT is overal aanwezig. Ook gespecialiseerde afdelingen zoals het Laboratorium of het Cathlab stellen hoge eisen aan de gebruikte technologie. In die geclassificeerde ruimtes kan bijvoorbeeld een standaard toetsenbord al een infectierisico vormen. Als IT’er denk je verder dan de meest efficiënte oplossing. Je houdt ook rekening met de veiligheidsrisico’s en de praktische context van een ziekenhuis dat 24/7 draait. Onderhoud aan systemen vereist dan ook nauwkeurige planning. Je kan een update niet zomaar uitvoeren terwijl de zorg gewoon doorgaat. Groot onderhoud gebeurt in overleg met de hele veiligheidsregio. In ons ziekenhuis draaien honderden applicaties, waaronder het elektronisch patiëntendossier en gespecialiseerde software zoals die voor Dialyse. Artsen en verpleegkundigen vertrouwen er dagelijks op. Dat maakt je werk als IT’er niet alleen uitdagend, maar ook van groot belang. Wat zijn de grootste uitdagingen voor onze IT’ers? Veiligheid, veiligheid en nog eens veiligheid. Hoe zorgen we voor gebruiksvriendelijke én veilige zorgportalen? Hoe beschermen we patiëntgegevens tegen datalekken? En hoe maken we onze systemen weerbaar tegen bijvoorbeeld DDoS\\-aanvallen? Werken in IT binnen het ziekenhuis is nooit saai, het is verantwoordelijk werk, met echte impact. Wil jij jezelf verbeteren als professional? En ons tegelijk helpen om nog betere zorg te verlenen? Zorg jij, samen met jouw team, ervoor dat duizenden hardware of computeronderdelen in ons ziekenhuis ‘up and running’ blijven?
   

  

 Het team van IT bestaat uit 15 collega’s en is verantwoordelijk voor de optimale beschikbaarheid en opvolging van het applicatie\\- en hardware landschap.
   

  

 Functie\\-inhoud
   

  

 Als senior systeembeheerder ga je aan de slag in een dynamisch en gemotiveerd team binnen de IT\\-dienst. Binnen het ziekenhuis ben je verantwoordelijk voor het implementeren, onderhouden en optimaliseren van complexe IT\\-infrastructuren en netwerken.
   

  

 Je staat in voor de operationele beveiliging door het implementeren van securityoplossingen ter bescherming van de data tegen cyberdreigingen. Vanuit je expertise geef je richting en bouw je mee aan de IT\\-infrastructuuroplossingen van morgen.
