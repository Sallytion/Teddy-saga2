 Job Location: Bangalore, India
   

  

 Experience : 3 \\- 5 years
   

  

**About Unifize:**
 At Unifize, we're building the AI\\-native product suite for regulated manufacturing companies. Our platform is designed to unify Quality, Operations, and R\\&D in a single collaborative system.
   

  

 Today, life sciences and other regulated manufacturers rely on a patchwork of disconnected tools, eg, QMS, DMS, PLM, MES, spreadsheets, and email, to manage their processes. This fragmentation slows down innovation, increases compliance risks, and forces teams to waste time manually connecting the dots.
   

  

 Unifize changes that by bringing process, documentation, and communication together in one place. Whether it's managing CAPAs, resolving deviations, launching new products, or preparing for audits, Unifize enables teams to work faster with full traceability and audit readiness built in.
   

  

 What makes Unifize different:
   

  

* No\\-code configuration for rapid deployment and adaptation
* Collaboration embedded in every record, not siloed in email or chat
* Context\\-aware AI that suggests actions, detects risks, and enhances productivity
* Flexible architecture that supports expansion across QMS, DMS, MES, PLM, CMMS, and more


 We're already working with leading companies in the life sciences and manufacturing sectors. Our customers start with one use case and consistently expand, with 100% net expansion to date.
   

  

 Check out our website, case studies, videos to learn more.
   

  

**The Role:**
 We're building a new AI Platform microservice that integrates tightly with our core Clojure\\-based system. This role involves leading backend development for this service, primarily in Python, working on AI/ML integrations and microservices architecture, and ensuring robust data handling via PostgreSQL.
   

  

 We don't expect prior experience with Clojure but value curiosity and a willingness to learn. This role is a good fit for engineers who enjoy ownership, functional programming principles, and building infrastructure that powers intelligent applications.
   

  

**Responsibilities:**
* Own and build Python\\-based backend services that interface with AI models and core product workflows
* Design and manage scalable PostgreSQL and vector database schemas and queries
* Develop and maintain RESTful APIs
* Collaborate with the platform and frontend teams to ensure clean integration with the larger Unifize system
* Contribute to design decisions, including service boundaries, API structure, and data pipelines
* Write clean, well\\-tested code and proactively review others' work


**Qualifications:**
* Strong proficiency in Python, with emphasis on clean, modular design
* Solid understanding of relational databases, particularly PostgreSQL
* Experience designing and consuming LLM APIs and writing integrations with them \\- having understanding of RAG, vectorisation
* Familiarity with architectural principles behind modern web applications
* Ability to work in a fast\\-paced environment with a collaborative, product\\-focused team


**Good to have:**
* Understanding of AI/ML model integrations and workflows in production environments
* Experience with functional or functional\\-style programming (e.g., Clojure, Elixir, Scala, Java 8\\+)
* Exposure to distributed systems and microservices
* Familiarity with message queues, job orchestration, or asynchronous processing","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/unifize","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQESy-dW5ACcrw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1723436775242/unifize_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7UoJaqIT_l4qJY2Ml4cBtkKNFY4QN0EBoG4OcOH5WHQ","","","","","","","","","","",""
