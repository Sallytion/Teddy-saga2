 Whatfix is an AI platform advancing the “userization” of enterprise applications, empowering companies to maximize the ROI of their digital investments. Technology needs adoption. It’s no different for AI. As AI reshapes roles, workflows, and human\\-machine interactions, it also introduces new layers of complexity and user friction. This is where Whatfix plays a pivotal role. A decade old DNA of empowering people to succeed with technology and not replacing them. We call this philosophy
 **Userization** 
 : the belief that technology must adapt to the user, not the other way around.
 



  





 At the heart of userization philosophy is
 **ScreenSense** 
 , our proprietary AI engine, which continuously interprets both the context of what users are doing in an application or an AI tool and the intent behind their actions. By combining these signals, Whatfix delivers real\\-time guidance, nudges, knowledge, and automation directly in the flow of work.
 



  





 This intelligence powers our entire product suite.
 


* **Digital Adoption** 
 helps users get productive faster.
* **Product Analytics** 
 uncovers friction and closes adoption gaps.
* **Mirror** 
 allows employees to train in safe, simulated environments.



  





 These are embedded with Whatfix
 **AI Agents** 
 which supercharge creation, insights, and user guidance.
 



 Our upcoming
 **AI\\-first products** 
 are already creating a buzz in the market.

 Together, these products reflect Whatfix’s commitment to building enterprise\\-ready AI teammates that maximize productivity and ROI. It gives users a unified, intelligent way to find answers across systems, apps, and knowledge silos and helps anyone looking to deliver fast and contextual answers.
 



  





 Whatfix is bridging the gap between rapid technological change and human enablement—ensuring AI is not only embedded but also usable, trusted, and outcome\\-driven for every employee.

 We are hiring for Java Software Engineer
 



 JD:
 



**Roles \\& Responsibilities** 



* Work as a Full Stack Software Engineer supporting two teams:
* Reporting \\& Interventions team
* Settings Platform team
* Both teams involve a combination of backend and frontend development.
* Support migration work from the existing architecture (separate Java backend and frontend stacks) to a server‑driven architecture.
* Contribute to iterative feature development on both platforms, including:
* Changes to reporting processes
* Interventions shown during login or account recovery
* Experience changes on the settings side
* Continue to support changes and iterations on the old architecture while migration is ongoing.
* Work across backend and frontend concerns, with flexibility depending on immediate team needs.



  





**Tools \\& Technical Skills** 



* Primary programming language: Java (core requirement).
* Kotlin:
* Considered a strong advantage
* Used in the new server‑driven architecture and Kotlin DSL
* No strict requirement on years of Kotlin experience
* Frontend technologies:
* No specific frontend framework is required (e.g., React, Swift, Objective‑C are not mandatory)
* Team is moving away from traditional native frontend development toward server‑driven UI using Kotlin
* Emphasis is on ability to learn and adapt, rather than experience in a specific frontend language.



  





**Day‑to‑Day Tasks** 



* Actively contribute to ongoing migration activities toward the new server‑driven architecture.
* Handle urgent, ad‑hoc requests for changes on existing systems.
* Develop and modify backend‑heavy functionality, with some frontend work handled through Kotlin DSL.
* Balance work between:
* Migration initiatives
* Enhancements and fixes on the current production stack



  





**Manager’s Expectations** 



* The candidate should be comfortable splitting effort between:
* Migration to the new architecture
* Ongoing development/support on the old architecture
* Strong Java fundamentals are critical; Kotlin familiarity is a plus but not a hard filter.
* Preference for engineers who can adapt quickly, learn new paradigms, and handle ambiguity during migration.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/aditiconsulting","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQFhSuWL16cn7A/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1655498607143/aditiconsulting_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=It4-tJV5B__QI2CpigNjluWwi6a7TieFq3intjkuAoA","","","","","","","","","","",""

* Support SonarCloud by aligning test assets and quality criteria with established security and quality gates, under the direction of the DevSecOps Specialist.
* Participate in deployment readiness and release coordination, validating that QA criteria are met before production deployments and supplying the necessary testing evidence for audit and change\\-control processes.
* Collaborate on CI/CD troubleshooting and optimization: investigate test\\-related pipeline failures, propose improvements, and implement changes under guidance from the DevSecOps Specialist and the DevSecOps Manager.
* Document DevOps\\-adjacent procedures (test automation patterns, pipeline QA stages, QA/DevOps runbooks) to support tribal knowledge capture, knowledge transfer to the DevSecOps Specialist, and DevSecOps roadmap execution.








**Additional Duties \\& Responsibilities** 



* Support audit readiness by providing structured QA and testing evidence, including coverage of executed tests and sign\\-off artifacts aligned to compliance and internal controls.
* Provide knowledge transfer for the DevSecOps Specialist, especially around test strategies, automation patterns, and quality gates.

**Work Environment** 




 This position may be based offshore (such as in India), and if so,
 **it requires working primarily during India night hours** 
 to align with U.S. business hours and team availability. Regardless of location, the role may require occasional evening work to support maintenance, upgrades, or release activities.
