 As one of the first pioneers of earned wage access, our passion at EarnIn is building products that deliver real\\-time financial flexibility for those with the unique needs of living paycheck to paycheck. Our community members access their earnings as they earn them, with options to spend, save, and grow their money without mandatory fees, interest rates, or credit checks.
 



 We’re fortunate to have an incredibly experienced leadership team, combined with world\\-class funding partners like A16Z, Matrix Partners, DST, Ribbit Capital, and a very healthy core business with a tremendous runway. We’re growing fast and are excited to continue bringing world\\-class talent onboard to help shape the next chapter of our growth journey.
 



**POSITION SUMMARY** 




 Platform at EarnIn strives to operate as a platform\\-as\\-product organization. We build the foundation that empowers product teams to ship quickly and safely: golden\\-path CI/CD, Kubernetes runtimes, observability, self\\-service workflows, and paved paths exposed through our developer control plane. We hold a high bar for operational excellence and measure our impact through developer velocity, reliability, and cost efficiency. We’re seeking a Senior Platform Engineer to design, build, and evolve the internal platform that powers EarnIn’s microservices and data systems. You’ll lead work across Kubernetes (AWS EKS), GitOps (Argo CD), CI/CD (GitHub Actions), service mesh (Linkerd), observability (Datadog), and our developer portal (Cortex), with a focus on safe change delivery, self\\-service, and reliability at scale. You’ll collaborate with DevX, SRE, and Product Engineering peers to simplify the SDLC, raise our reliability posture, and turn fragmented workflows into intuitive golden paths, aligned with our Platform Engineer growth matrix (autonomy, reliability, team contribution, and responsible AI fluency).
 



 This position will be hybrid from our Bengaluru office, as part of our expanding site. EarnIn provides excellent employee benefits, including healthcare, internet/cell phone reimbursement, a learning and development stipend, and opportunities to collaborate with and travel to our Palo Alto HQ and Bangkok Site. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location.
 



**WHAT YOU'LL DO** 



* Design and evolve GitOps\\-based continuous delivery with Argo CD and Argo Rollouts (progressive delivery, automated rollbacks), integrating with our CI pipelines and standardized Helm/Kustomize workflows.
* Advance our Kubernetes platform on AWS EKS with strong multi\\-env hygiene, security (Pod Identity/RBAC), and rollout strategies; partner on cluster\\-level upgrades and “cluster vending” patterns for safer blue/green upgrades over time.
* Leverage our developer control plane (Cortex) to expose paved paths, scorecards, and self\\-service actions (bootstrap, deploy, SLOs, operations) so teams can move from idea to production smoothly.
* Strengthen observability and operational excellence: SLOs/error budgets, Datadog metrics/traces/logs, RUM (where applicable), and blameless postmortems that lead to preventive actions and automation.
* Partner with SRE to embed reliability gates into pipelines (pre\\-merge and pre\\-deploy validation, canary policies), and improve MTTD/MTTR through better telemetry and predictable rollback strategies.
* Contribute to and maintain service scaffolds, templates, and shared frameworks that encode standards (testing, security, telemetry), and keep supported language/framework versions aligned to platform baselines.
* Apply AI responsibly across diagnostics, validation, and CI/CD/ops workflows (e.g., anomaly detection, test generation, performance triage), measuring outcomes and iterating for impact.



**WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR** 



* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, or related experience.
* 4\\+ years in platform, infrastructure, or backend engineering with deep hands\\-on experience in Kubernetes (preferably EKS) and cloud\\-native architectures on AWS.
* Expertise in GitOps and CD (ArgoCD/Argo Rollouts) and CI (GitHub Actions; reusable workflows, shared actions) for multi\\-service systems at scale.
* Strong coding skills in Go and/or Python (Java/Kotlin is a plus), treating infrastructure as software; fluency with Helm/Kustomize and Terraform (IaC) for platform automation.
* Solid observability skills (Datadog APM/metrics/tracing/logs) with a track record of improving reliability and driving SLO/error\\-budget culture.
* Experience with service mesh (e.g., Linkerd) and traffic management patterns for progressive delivery and resilience.
* Demonstrated AI fluency applied to the SDLC (validation, diagnostics, automation) with a bias for measurement and iteration
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills; mentoring mindset and ability to influence teams toward consistent standards and safer delivery at speed.
* Experience evolving multi\\-cluster strategies (blue/green upgrades, cluster vending), automated validation (e.g., Testkube), and DR/chaos practices is a plus.
* Hands\\-on contributions to developer productivity insights (lead time, change fail rate) and FinOps observability for cost\\-aware engineering decisions are a plus.

OCI is committed to providing the best in cloud products that meet the needs of our customers who are tackling some of the world’s biggest challenges.
 



 Oracle’s Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) team is a new ground\\-up effort to build Infrastructure\\-as\\-a\\-Service that operates at a high scale in a broadly distributed multi\\-tenant cloud environment. Our customers run their businesses on our cloud, and our mission is to provide them with best\\-in\\-class compute, storage, networking, database, security, and an ever\\-expanding set of foundational cloud\\-based services. These are exciting times in our space \\- we are growing fast, still at a relatively early stage, and working on ambitious new initiatives.
 



 We are building a new Software Assurance Gateway team at OCI. Our mission is to build and operate a set of gateway services to perform comprehensive software assurance of the applications running within a tenancy. Software assurance includes measures to prevent the deployment of malware or vulnerable, malicious, or unauthorized code into the application’s tenancy. It also includes monitoring the flow of data in and out of the application’s tenancy to prevent unauthorized exfiltration of data.
 



  





 The software gateway services will intercept web traffic, operator actions, and CI/CD pipelines to perform a set of assurance functions such as vulnerability scanning, signature validation, rules checking, policy compliance and anomaly detection. These functions will generate logs, audit trails, metrics, and alerts to enable automated and manual assurance of code as well as ingress/egress traffic. The team will develop and maintain the gateway code as well as operate the gateway infrastructure for the application. The team will be responsible for the performance, scalability, and reliability of the gateways. In particular, they will be responsible for ensuring that the performance of the application, as well as the developer velocity of the application teams, are not negatively impacted by the assurance gateways. They will optimize the gateway code to ensure low overhead and they will scale the gateways to handle increases in traffic and in the frequencies of application updates.
 



  





 As Senior Software Engineer, you will work with a team of software engineers responsible for the software design, development, and operations for our new and existing products. You should be able to architect broad systems interactions, be hands\\-on, be able to dive deep into any part of the stack, and have a good sense of cloud infrastructure and networking knowledge. You should value simplicity and impact, work comfortably in a collaborative, agile environment, and be excited to learn.
 



 Our senior engineers are also the people who can work independently and provide technical leadership to the organization. You should have experience developing and operating high\\-scale services, and an understanding of how to make these cloud\\-scale services resilient. The ideal candidate will be technically strong and productive; someone who knows how to balance speed and quality with iterative and incremental improvements. You understand operational excellence and know\\-how to infuse a culture of being proactive within your team. You recommend and justify major changes to new and existing products and establish consensus with data\\-driven approaches.
