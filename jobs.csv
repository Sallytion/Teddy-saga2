**Technologies we use \\-**
 React.js, Redux, Typescript, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Clickhouse, Spark, Scala, Elixir, Kubernetes, Graphite, Redis, Python
   

  

 Rather than hire for a particular role or title, we are eager to speak with interested candidates, and structure roles that satisfy your aspirations and meet our rapidly changing engineering requirements. We encourage exceptional software engineers with all levels of experience to apply to Clarisights.
 **We are particularly keen to hire applicants with 3 to 5 years of experience.**
**What do we mean by exceptional?**
* Excellent programming skills. We expect all our engineers at every level to code with enthusiasm.
* A deep appreciation for software engineering founded in first principles. We are not looking for proficiency in specific languages or stacks. Instead, we want engineers who command a deep knowledge of the tools and languages they have worked with. And can communicate this knowledge effectively.
* A hacker mentality to building things. We hire people who are willing to pick up a problem and iterate solutions with originality and speed. And then move on to the next problem.
* You take out your own trash. We are building a no\\-BS, low\\-touch, low\\-anxiety workplace. (This is really hard.) We like people to manage their own time, tools, and projects with self\\-awareness and transparency. We will give you feedback regularly and then give you all the tools you need to get better at what you do. And then we will let you get on with it.
* An approach to work that is collaborative, constructive, and optimistic. Our engineers often work in small functional and cross\\-functional teams. A positive teamwork attitude is essential.
* A willingness to learn. We don't expect applicants to be exposed to marketing. Instead, we are happy to hire talented engineers and teach them what they need to know.
* Strong opinions are held lightly. We like to work with people who feel strongly about things but can also change their minds when they have to.


**What can you expect to do?**
* Redesign and rebuild our codebase into a form and shape ready for the next stage of our growth.
* Translate state\\-of\\-the\\-art software development into state\\-of\\-the\\-art product experiences for our users. Just like software engineers advanced from Notepad to IDEs, we want our users to leap forward from spreadsheets to responsive and interactive data workspaces.
* Build, maintain, and evolve systems and sub\\-systems that help us solve problems in power\\-user UIs, ETL automation, databases, and infrastructure.
* Adopt and invent engineering solutions that can help Clarisights do more for our current customers and also diversify into new business verticals.
* Work closely with the Customer Success and Solutions Engineering functions to address emerging customer problems. We have fantastic customers who come up with fantastic problems.
* We derive engineering inspiration and product direction from companies such as Snowflake, Notion, Grafana, Looker, Tableau, and Fivetran. This means our engineers are constantly exploring, testing, and building new technology. And then starting all over again.


**What we offer 🌟**
* Ownership. You won’t be delegated tasks. You will be given ownership and accountability of outcomes and all the support you need. It is your task to figure out how to remove roadblocks and reach the desired outcomes.
* Learning. We are just getting started, and you will have a unique vantage point on how to build a company with a very strong product and massive customer demand. You will probably learn more than you ever thought in the process. These learnings are most likely the most valuable thing we can offer. Curious people thrive at Clarisights.
* Meaning. At Clarisights, your work matters. It has consequences. Our engineers work on projects that are unique in vision and unsurpassed in scale. Our talent team is building a world\\-class team across every function. And our SSMs are more than just advocating for a product: they are changing the way companies work with data.
* Wealth. We pay competitive salaries and offer generous equity. And we’re building a workplace that is low\\-anxiety, light\\-management, high\\-impact, and collegial. We want people to do good work with great people in a kind environment.

 Operational excellence at Trilogy is not optional—it is the competitive edge that defines us. We move quickly to acquire software companies and scale them even more rapidly. To sustain this pace, we require leaders who architect lean, automated systems rather than expand complexity through headcount.
   

  

 You will take full ownership of end\\-to\\-end transformations spanning our global portfolio. This might involve redesigning the offboarding process for 1,200\\+ employees following an acquisition, replacing platforms like Jira and Salesforce with AI agents, or creating automations that remove thousands of manual hours. Execution will be rapid, leveraging Python, LLM APIs, and tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, and MCP—supported by a library of battle\\-tested playbooks that keep you focused on results.
   

  

 Trilogy manages a portfolio of 100\\+ products with relentless efficiency. We function with reduced hierarchy, accelerated cycles, and elevated standards compared to conventional enterprise settings. This is an opportunity to generate large\\-scale impact without navigating bureaucracy or overseeing inflated teams.
   

  

 We do not maintain steady\\-state operations. We do not delegate transformation to others. And we do not bring on individuals who require approval or extensive teams to execute. We seek a select group of deeply technical, execution\\-oriented leaders who treat automation as leverage and velocity as a strategic advantage.

* Implementing AI\\-powered workflows through Cursor, Windsurf, and MCP to remove manual processes and cut latency
* Owning initiatives from assessment through deployment, applying proven playbooks and executive\\-level decision\\-making
* Passing a hands\\-on technical assessment that validates your capability to design and implement AI\\-first solutions


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Building or managing large teams or depending on organizational layers to achieve outcomes
* Spending time in prolonged alignment sessions or waiting for consensus before acting
* Handing off the complex work to IT departments or third\\-party vendors—you will architect and deliver the solution directly
* Running steady\\-state operations—this position centers on transformation and speed


**AI Operations Specialist Key Responsibilities**
 Architect and implement AI\\-first operational systems that remove manual workload, reduce complexity, and enable scalable execution across Trilogy's global software portfolio.
   

  

**Basic Requirements**
* Located in North America (excluding California), South/Central America, or Western Europe (UTC \\-8 to UTC \\+2\\)
* 5\\+ years of operational leadership in enterprise software
* 3\\+ years in customer\\-facing roles (Support, Sales, Collections, etc.)
* Proven ability to write automation in Python and integrate with LLM APIs
* Experience using Cursor, Windsurf, MCP, or similar tools to deliver production\\-grade automations
* Demonstrated capacity to act quickly, think independently, and deliver high\\-stakes outcomes without oversight


**Nice\\-to\\-have Requirements**
* Background leading large\\-scale organizational transitions such as M\\&A integrations or mass offboarding
* Track record of designing and deploying AI\\-driven operational systems
