 Department: R\\&D Engineering
 



 Location: Octobotics HQ (Noida/On\\-Site)
 



  





 The Mission: To successfully migrate our legacy ROS 1 architecture to a high\\-performance ROS 2 Native ecosystem, architecting a navigation stack that survives the ""unheard\\-of"" edge cases of the real world.
 



  





**1\\. The Context: The Great Migration** 




 Octobotics is at a pivot point. Our legacy stack was built on ROS 1 (Noetic). It got us to MVP. But to scale, we are tearing it down and rebuilding in ROS 2 (Humble/Iron).
 



 We are not looking for someone to maintain old code. We are looking for an Architect to lead this migration. You will deal with the pain of bridging ros1\\_bridge, porting custom messages, and rewriting node lifecycles from scratch. If you are afraid of breaking changes and complex dependency hell, stop reading now.
 



**2\\. The ""Scorecard"" (Outcomes)** 



* **The Migration:** 
 Port our core navigation and control logic from ROS 1 to ROS 2\\. This involves rewriting nodes to utilize
 **Lifecycle Management** 
 and
 **Node Composition** 
 for zero\\-copy transfer.
* **Nav2 Architecture:** 
 We don't just ""install"" Nav2\\. You will write custom
 **Behavior Tree plugins** 
 and
 **Costmap layers** 
 to handle dynamic obstacles in unstructured environments.
* **Middleware Optimization:** 
 You will own the
 **DDS layer** 
 (FastDDS/CycloneDDS). You must tune QoS profiles for lossy WiFi environments and debug discovery traffic issues that traditional network engineers don't understand.
* **Sensor Fusion \\& State Estimation:** 
 Implement and tune EKF/UKF pipelines (robot\\_localization) to fuse IMU, Wheel Odometry, and LiDAR. You must understand
 **Covariance Matrices** 
 —if your covariance grows unbounded, you have failed.
* **Serialization Strategy:** 
 Implement
 **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** 
 for high\\-efficiency, non\\-ROS internal data logging and inter\\-process communication where overhead must be zero.



**3\\. Technical Requirements (The Hard Skills)** 




**The Stack (ROS 1 \\& ROS 2\\):** 



* **Deep ROS 2 Mastery:** 
 You know the difference between spin(), spin\\_some(), and Multi\\-Threaded Executors. You understand
 *why* 
 we are moving to ROS 2 (Real\\-time constraints, DDS security, QoS).
* **Navigation Stack:** 
 In\\-depth knowledge of
 **Nav2** 
 (Planners, Controllers, Recoveries). You understand Global vs. Local planners (A\\*, DWB, TEB).
* **SLAM \\& Localization:** 
 Experience with
 **Graph\\-based SLAM** 
 (Cartographer, SLAM Toolbox). You know how to close loops and optimize pose graphs.



**The Math (The ""Weeder""):** 



* **Linear Algebra \\& Geometry:** 
 Rigid body transformations are your second language. You understand
 **Quaternions** 
 , homogeneous transformation matrices ($T \\\\in SE(3\\)$), and how to avoid Gimbal Lock.
* **Kinematics:** 
 You can derive Forward and Inverse Kinematics for Differential Drive and Ackermann steering chassis.
* **Probabilistic Robotics:** 
 Understanding of Bayesian estimation. You know that sensors are noisy and that ""Ground Truth"" is a myth.



**The Code:** 



* **C\\+\\+ (14/17\\):** 
 Real\\-time safe coding standards. RAII, Smart Pointers, and template metaprogramming.
* **Python:** 
 For prototyping and complex orchestration.



**4\\. The ""Topgrading"" Filter (Do NOT apply if...)** 



* You think roslaunch is the same as ros2 launch.
* You have never defined a custom .msg or .srv file.
* You struggle to visualize a TF tree in your head (map \\-\\> odom \\-\\> base\\_link).
* You think latency ""doesn't matter"" in a control loop.



**5\\. The Challenge: Surfing the Tsunami** 




 Let’s be honest: (Industrial Mobile Robots) is hard.
 



 We are solving problems that are unheard of in the standard ""Industrial"" world.
 



 There will be days when the Sensor Fusion drifts for no reason. There will be days when the DDS discovery fails because of a multicast storm. There will be architectural ""Tsunamis"" that threaten to wipe out our sprint.
 



 We are looking for the engineer who doesn't run for higher ground, but grabs a board and says,

 4\\+ years of professional software engineering experience
   

  

 Strong full\\-stack experience, with meaningful contributions to both frontend and backend systems
   

  

 Solid frontend expertise with React, Next.js, or similar frameworks
   

  

 Deep backend experience in Python, Go, Java, Node.js, or similar
   

  

 Strong fundamentals in databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or similar)
   

  

 Good understanding of data pipelines and distributed data\\-heavy systems
   

  

 Strong product mindset \\- able to reason about trade\\-offs and business impact
