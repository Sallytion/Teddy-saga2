 We build with leverage — and that often means writing custom software, automation, and tools that power smarter marketing, faster prospecting, and better decision\\-making. If you love using code to solve real business problems, not just writing clean abstractions, you’ll thrive here.
 



  





 Role Summary
 



 We’re hiring creative, technically sharp college freshers as Junior Software Engineers.

* Real\\-world scraping, automation, and integration workflows across modern web tech
* How to build internal tools and automations that drive actual business metrics
* Fast prototyping for go\\-to\\-market teams, including outreach, enrichment, and CRM tooling
* How to think like a growth engineer: blending marketing, product, and code
* Exposure to AI tools and positioning, across multiple product verticals



  





  





 You’ll Love This Role If You:
 


* Enjoy writing code to solve business problems, not just build abstractions
* Are familiar with Python or JavaScript and love automating manual workflows
* Have tinkered with web scraping, browser scripting, APIs, bots, or Zapier
* Like working at speed, with short feedback loops and high ownership
* Are self\\-driven, curious, and coachable — eager to learn and ship real work



  





  





 Tools You’ll Use
 


* Languages: Python, JavaScript
* Tools/Frameworks: Playwright, Puppeteer, BeautifulSoup, Selenium
* Platforms: Phantombuster, Zapier, Retool, HubSpot, Postman

 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""
