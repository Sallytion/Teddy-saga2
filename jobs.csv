 **understand what users want, why they want it, and how that requirement can be best delivered through AI models, prompts, and pipelines** 
 .
 



 This is a
 **full\\-time, entry\\-level role (1\\.5\\+ years experience)** 
 with heavy emphasis on
 **research, experimentation, learning, and iteration** 
 .
 



  





**Core Responsibilities** 




 1\\. User Research \\& Requirement Understanding
 


* Study and analyze
 **user needs** 
 across textile designers, screen printers, and apparel brands.

 *“ethnic but modern”, “export\\-friendly floral”, “budget print design”* 
 ) into
 **structured AI\\-understandable inputs** 
 .
* Identify
 **patterns in user requests** 
 and convert them into reusable design logic, workflows, and AI strategies.
* Work closely with stakeholders to document

 (styles, occasions, markets, printing constraints).
* Translate traditional textile knowledge into
 **AI\\-friendly classifications and metadata** 
 .



 3\\. Dataset Strategy \\& Design Intelligence
 


* Design and maintain
 **high\\-quality textile image datasets** 
 aligned with user needs and printing realities.
* Define dataset structure based on
 **design purpose** 
 , not just volume (e.g., commercial prints vs. fashion\\-forward designs).
* Continuously refine datasets based on
 **user feedback and output quality** 
 .



 4\\. AI Model Selection \\& Management (Decision\\-Oriented)
 


* Design and maintain a
 **Python\\-based AI management system** 
 that selects the most suitable AI model based on:
* User intent
* Design complexity
* Style requirements
* Cost and latency constraints
* Research strengths and limitations of different
 **image generation and processing models** 
 and map them to real\\-world use cases.



 5\\. Prompt Engineering \\& Design Translation
 


* Convert user requirements into
 **enterprise\\-grade prompts** 
 that reliably produce usable textile designs.
* Experiment with prompt structures to improve:
* Style accuracy
* Repeatability
* Print suitability
* Build prompt templates and libraries based on
 **common user design needs** 
 .



 6\\. AI Training, Fine\\-Tuning \\& Validation
 


* Fine\\-tune and train models using
 **domain\\-specific textile datasets** 
 .
* Evaluate AI outputs against
 **user expectations and commercial usability** 
 , not just visual quality.
* Iterate models and prompts based on real feedback from designers or printing workflows.



 7\\. Cost Optimization \\& Practical AI Strategy

 **cost\\-efficient AI generation strategies** 
 .
* Decide when:
* A large model is needed
* A smaller or fine\\-tuned model is sufficient
* Balance
 **quality vs. cost** 
 based on user requirements and business goals.



 8\\. Continuous Research \\& Technology Awareness
 


* Stay updated with
 **latest AI models, research papers, and tools** 
 relevant to generative design.
* Evaluate new technologies based on
 **practical usefulness** 
 , not hype.
* Work with the development team to implement promising AI advancements.



  





**Required Skills \\& Background** 




 Must\\-Have
 


* 1\\.5\\+ years of experience in
 **AI/ML, data science, or software development** 
 .
* Strong
 **research mindset** 
 – ability to explore, experiment, and document findings.
* Proficiency in
 **Python**

* Prompt engineering
* Computer vision
* Interest or basic understanding of:
* Textile design
* Fashion
* Screen printing or production constraints



 What You’ll Gain
