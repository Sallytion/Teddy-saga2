* **Handle efficient local caching, model loading, and concurrent request management for responsive UX.**



**3\\. Performance \\& Scalability** 



* **Optimize front\\-end rendering and data transfer for sub\\-second multimodal interactions (e.g., token streaming, progressive rendering).**
* **Implement asynchronous I/O and event\\-driven backends for high concurrency and low latency.**
* **Profile and tune browser and backend performance under multimodal workloads.**



**4\\. UX/UI for AI Interactions** 



* **Prototype and refine AI\\-native UI patterns (real\\-time chat streaming, voice controls, dynamic image panels, etc).**
* **Collaborate with designers to make complex AI capabilities intuitive and accessible.**
* **Conduct user testing and feedback loops to ensure the experience feels fast, private, and premium.**



**5\\. Reliability, Security \\& Local Privacy** 



* **Implement strong sandboxing, local data storage, and access controls to ensure user data never leaves the appliance.**
* **Maintain robust CI/CD pipelines for frequent local software updates.**
* **Ensure fail\\-safe handling of multimodal data (e.g., secure local video/audio processing).**








**Required Qualifications:** 



* **10\\+ years of experience in full\\-stack web application development.**
* **Proficiency in modern front\\-end frameworks (React, Next.js, Svelte, or Vue) and TypeScript/JavaScript.**
* **Strong backend experience in Python (FastAPI/Flask), Node.js, Go, or Rust.**
* **Deep understanding of real\\-time web technologies \\- WebSockets, WebRTC, event streams, and async APIs.**
* **Experience interfacing with AI/ML backends via REST or gRPC APIs.**
* **Strong grounding in systems programming concepts \\- memory management, concurrency, and performance optimization.**
* **Comfortable with Linux, Docker, and command\\-line tools for local development and deployment.**








**Preferred Qualifications:** 



* **Experience building apps that integrate LLMs, text\\-to\\-image, or speech models.**
* **Familiarity with multimodal data handling \\- audio/video streaming, file parsing, camera/mic APIs.**
* **Exposure to WebGPU, WebAssembly, or other browser\\-based acceleration techniques.**
* **Understanding of edge or local\\-first architectures and offline data persistence.**
* **Design sensitivity \\- ability to prototype clean, modern interfaces for AI interactions.**
