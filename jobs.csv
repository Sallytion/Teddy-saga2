 Modern ads platforms run on always\\-on, real\\-time data: streaming events, feature computation, near\\-real\\-time aggregations, and low\\-latency serving to power ML models that operate at massive scale under strict freshness, cost, and reliability requirements.
   

  

 Microsoft Ads builds and operates large\\-scale, latency\\-sensitive systems that serve billions of requests. We are looking for a Principal Software Engineer who is hands\\-on with production coding and system design to build the real\\-time data pipelines and feature/embedding materialization systems that feed online stores/caches and integrate tightly with ML inference serving.
   

  

**This Role Is Ideal For Engineers Who Enjoy**
* building robust streaming \\+ ETL systems (correctness, idempotency, backfills, late data),
* owning SLOs with strong observability and operational maturity,
* and optimizing end\\-to\\-end performance and cost across compute, storage, and serving integrations.


 Primary success metrics are freshness, correctness, latency, reliability, and cost in production.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Design and implement real\\-time streaming ETL / feature pipelines (e.g., Flink or Spark Structured Streaming) that meet strict freshness and correctness constraints.
* Build and operate reliable messaging and ingestion with Kafka/Pulsar (partitioning strategy, retries, ordering guarantees, DLQs, backpressure handling).
* Own data contracts between producers, pipelines, and consumers: schema evolution, versioning, compatibility, validation, and safe rollout.
* Implement production\\-grade backfill/replay workflows
* Define and meet SLOs using OpenTelemetry/Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, tracing, dashboards, alerting, and incident response readiness.
* Integrate pipelines with online stores/caches and ML consumers (feature stores, embedding pipelines, LLM API calls, online/offline consistency patterns).
* Partner with applied scientists on feature/embedding definitions, validation, and end\\-to\\-end quality measurement.
* Optimize end\\-to\\-end performance and efficiency: CPU/memory/I/O, serialization, caching, network overhead, concurrency, and pipeline compute cost.
* Contribute to serving/inference integrations where needed (e.g., Triton/ONNX Runtime/TensorRT) including batching and latency/cost tradeoffs.
* Ship safely with CI/CD, automated testing (unit/integration/data quality), and operational playbooks/runbooks.


**Qualifications**
**Required Qualification:**
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Electrical/Computer Engineering, or a related field, with 8\\+ years of related experience.
* Strong programming skills in language C\\+\\+,C\\# or Python (at least one required).
* Hands\\-on experience in one or more:
+ Building and operating streaming data pipelines in production (Flink or Spark Structured Streaming),
+ Distributed systems engineering with strong reliability and operational rigor,
+ Messaging systems such as Kafka/Pulsar.

* Experience operating services with Kubernetes/containers and production readiness practices (deployments, scaling, rollbacks).
* Experience with observability stacks such as OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana.
* Ability to debug complex production issues using logs/metrics/traces and performance profiling.
* Strong communication and collaboration skills, with experience working across engineering, applied science/ML, and product/business stakeholders.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Experience with feature stores, embedding pipelines, and online/offline consistency (freshness guarantees, correctness validation).
* Experience with data lakehouse/table formats and optimizations eg partitioning, compaction, and incremental processing.
* Experience with GPU inference serving (Triton, ONNX Runtime/TensorRT) and performance techniques (batching, request shaping, tail\\-latency reduction).
* understanding of pipeline correctness patterns: idempotency, dedup, watermarking, late data, exactly\\-once vs at\\-least\\-once tradeoffs.
* Background in cost/performance modeling, capacity planning, and reliability improvements for high\\-scale data platforms.
* Experience in Ads/search/recommendations or other high\\-scale systems where freshness, latency, and cost are jointly optimized.
