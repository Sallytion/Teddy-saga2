 Nasuni is headquartered in Boston, USA with offices in Cork\\-Ireland, London\\-UK and we are starting an India Innovation Center in Hyderabad India to leverage exuberant IT talent available in India. The company’s recent Annual Revenue is $160M and growing at 25% CAGR.
   

  

 We have a hybrid work culture. 3 days a week working from the Hyderabad office during core working hours and 2 days working from home. For Principal experts in Kubernetes and Storage we will consider more flexible or remote options.
   

  

**The Principal Software Engineer \\- Kubernetes role.**
 We are looking for a Principal Software Engineer with deep expertise in Kubernetes, CSI driver development, and systems programming in Golang and/or C\\+\\+. In this hands\\-on role, you will lead the design and implementation of scalable, production\\-grade integrations that enable our NAS appliance to run natively within Kubernetes environments. You’ll develop a custom CSI driver, work closely with NFS / SMB protocols, and optimize storage operations within containerized workloads. Strong knowledge of Linux systems, Kubernetes internals, and cloud\\-native storage concepts is essential, along with a passion for building reliable infrastructure software used in enterprise\\-scale deployments.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Lead the architecture, design, and Kubernetes\\-native deployment of our next\\-generation NAS appliance, enabling cloud\\-native workloads to access and manage data efficiently and securely.
* Design and implement a robust CSI (Container Storage Interface) driver to expose the appliance's NAS capabilities (e.g. NFS, SMB) to Kubernetes environments, supporting persistent volumes, dynamic provisioning, snapshots, and related storage lifecycle operations.
* Collaborate closely with product, platform, and architecture teams to define the technical strategy for container storage integration, ensuring that the system supports multi\\-tenancy, scalability, and high availability.
* Work extensively with storage protocols such as NFSv3/v4, SMB, and CIFS, integrating them into the Kubernetes ecosystem in a performant and secure manner.
* Deeply interact with the Linux subsystem, including the VFS layer, mount namespaces, filesystems, and kernel\\-level tuning to ensure performance and stability of storage mounts within containers.
* Develop Kubernetes\\-compliant packaging and lifecycle automation using Helm, Operators, and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to facilitate deployment and upgrades of the NAS appliance in production clusters.
* Troubleshoot complex issues across distributed systems, networking, and persistent storage layers — including root cause analysis across the stack: containers, orchestration, filesystem, and kernel.
* Act as a subject matter expert (SME) for Kubernetes storage integrations and provide technical leadership in sprint planning, code reviews, and architectural decision\\-making.
* Mentor junior engineers, foster knowledge sharing, and help build a high\\-performance, high\\-collaboration engineering culture.


**Required Qualifications**
* 9\\+ years of hands\\-on experience in professional software engineering, with a strong background in building high\\-performance, scalable, and production\\-grade systems — preferably in storage or infrastructure\\-focused domains.
* Advanced programming proficiency in Golang and/or C\\+\\+, with the ability to design and implement robust, maintainable system components. Should be comfortable working across both user space and kernel\\-adjacent code paths.
* Proven experience building or contributing to a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver or Kubernetes\\-native storage solution. Deep understanding of CSI specifications, driver lifecycle, and integration with Kubernetes control plane.
* In\\-depth knowledge of Kubernetes internals, including the architecture of:
* Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
* Controllers and Operators
* StatefulSets, DaemonSets, and volume lifecycle management
* Scheduling implications of storage and node affinity
* Strong grasp of Kubernetes storage concepts
* Experience with NAS and traditional file\\-based storage systems, particularly with protocols like:
* NFS (v3/v4\\) — mount options, lock handling, network tuning
* SMB/CIFS — integration, authentication, performance tuning
* Object storage (S3, MinIO, Ceph, etc.) is a plus
* Deep Linux systems experience
* Hands\\-on experience with container runtimes, such as Docker, containerd, and CRI\\-O, with familiarity in troubleshooting and optimizing performance in containerized environments.
* Experience working with CI/CD pipelines, version control systems (Git), and infrastructure automation tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD, or similar).

These improvements directly impact product time\\-to\\-market and customer satisfaction. Historically, software deployment timelines have been delayed by conventional coding methods, with approximately 30% of projects running behind schedule due to inefficiencies and defects.
   

  

 IgniteTech is at the helm of this transformation, embedding cutting\\-edge GenAI technologies to reshape software architecture and development practices. This position moves beyond incremental optimization and instead provides the unique opportunity to spearhead strategic AI\\-driven initiatives. You will lead efforts to integrate AI in ways that fundamentally revolutionize—not merely enhance—software development workflows and results, driving substantial gains in efficiency and competitive positioning.
   

  

 This role is built for individuals who seek to operate at the forefront of technological innovation. It is not a task\\-execution or operational position; rather, it is a strategic role centered on extensive research and development, prototyping, and the deployment of AI to build next\\-generation software solutions. We seek candidates who not only possess deep expertise in AI and software architecture but also bring a visionary mindset to applying technology for business transformation.
   

  

 In this capacity, you will guide our team in defining the architectural frameworks and strategies that embed AI throughout our software offerings.

We welcome you to apply if you are eager to challenge technological limits and create measurable impact in the software industry.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Architect comprehensive systems for AI\\-powered automation of complex software development activities, including architecture generation, dependency orchestration, and advanced predictive coding capabilities.
* Engage deeply with emerging trends in AI and software engineering through research and development efforts, conference participation, and active collaboration with academic and industry networks. As new AI technologies emerge, we expect to be among the earliest adopters.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Routine Code Maintenance: Performing regular updates or debugging of existing codebases to address minor bugs or enhance functionality.
* Standard Software Development: Executing basic development tasks that involve implementing simple features or functionalities without the integration of AI.


**Lead AI Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Apply your engineering expertise to achieve substantial gains in development velocity, reduction in human errors, and elevation of code quality, driving faster product time\\-to\\-market and improved customer satisfaction.


**Basic Requirements**
* A minimum of 3 years of experience as a full\\-stack software developer (must include both front\\-end and back\\-end coding proficiency)
* Extensive experience utilizing GenAI code assistants (e.g., Github Copilot, Cursor.sh, v0\\.dev)
* Proven track record of successfully implementing Generative AI products/projects/solutions/tools
* Prior experience applying various LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, Mistral) to address business challenges
* Clear understanding of when and why to select specific LLM models for different use cases
* Demonstrated knowledge and practical application of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

If you require further support or reasonable adjustments with regards to the recruitment process (for example, you require the application form in a different format), please contact the team via Careers Support.","Civil Engineering, Design Services, and IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/jacobs","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEqi0xvuMeuew/company-logo_100_100/B4EZfF35ikHYAQ-/0/1751371454940/jacobs_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=UKW8ggrtSMTSOWMS5cGkK1CV1VF4AhGsIFEwlJkbfSQ","","","","","","","","","","",""
