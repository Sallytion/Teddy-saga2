 At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.
 



 To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.
 



 Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.
 



 While many roles at Coinbase are remote\\-first, we are not remote\\-only. In\\-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company\\-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.
 



 The mission of the Platform Product Group engineers is to build a trusted, scalable and compliant platform to operate with speed, efficiency and quality. Our teams build and maintain the platforms critical to the existence of Coinbase. There are many teams that make up this group which include Product Foundations (i.e. Identity, Payment, Risk, Proofing \\& Regulatory, Finhub), Machine Learning, Customer Experience, and Infrastructure.
   

  

 Finance Engineering team is building Coinbase’s financial nervous system: a unified, automated reconciliation and payments\\-data platform that Finance relies on to close the books with precision, speed, and audit‑grade controls. In 2026, we’re making daily, transaction‑level cash reconciliation the standard across our businesses, shipping a unified recon interface that spans cash and crypto, standardizing external bank and processor data with enforceable quality contracts, and compressing finance reviews to a single clean iteration.
 



 As a Senior Software Engineer at Coinbase,  you will join our team to build out the next generation of crypto\\-forward products and features. You will solve unique, large scale, highly complex technical problems, bridging the constraints posed by web\\-scale applications and blockchain technology.

* Build new services to meet critical product and business needs using Golang.
* Design scalable systems to solve novel problems with modern cloud technology and industry best practices.

* Work with engineers, designers, product managers and senior leadership to turn our product and technical vision into a tangible roadmap every quarter.
* Write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers. Debugging extremely difficult technical problems, and making systems and products both work better and are easier to deploy, own, operate and diagnose.
* Review all feature designs within your product area and across the company for cross\\-cutting projects. Be an owner of the security, safety, scale, operational integrity, and architectural clarity of these designs.
* Streamline processes in accounting, tax, treasury, and finance operations.
* Reduce reliance on manual tools by implementing AI/ML\\-driven automation



**What we look for in you:** 



* You have at least 5\\+ years of experience in software engineering.
* You’ve designed, built, scaled and maintained production services, and know how to compose a service oriented architecture.
* You write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers.
* You’re passionate about building an open financial system that brings the world together.
* You possess strong technical skills for system design and coding
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, and a bias toward open, transparent cultural practices.

* You have gone through a rapid growth in your company (from startup to mid\\-size).
* Experience with  growth experiments or A/B testing frameworks.
* You have experience with Blockchain technology (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc..)

**This is not a corporate job. This is a builder's role.** 



 About SmartDocs
 
 SmartDocs is a 16\\-year\\-old, profitable, bootstrapped enterprise SaaS company competing head\\-to\\-head with SAP Ariba and Coupa. We serve 26 enterprise customers—primarily major US infrastructure organizations processing millions of dollars in procurement transactions daily on our platform.
 



 We're transforming from successful bootstrapped roots to Silicon Valley\\-grade engineering operations while maintaining our owner mindset and execution obsession.
 


 Who We're Looking ForThe Ideal Background
 
 We're seeking technical leaders with
 **entrepreneurial battle scars** 
 —founding engineers, technical co\\-founders, or early engineering leaders who built something from scratch. You understand what it takes to ship quality software when every decision matters.
 



**You might be:** 



* A technical co\\-founder/founding engineer who took a startup from idea to production
* An early engineering leader (first 5\\-10 hires) who architected and scaled a product
* A CTO/Engineering Director from a bootstrapped, capital\\-efficient company
* Someone who worked with founders/CEOs on mission\\-critical applications where system reliability directly impacted business survival



**What matters most:** 
 You've built something significant with your own hands, made critical technical decisions with constrained resources, and understand the weight of engineering choices when real customers and revenue depend on your platform.
 


 Technical Must\\-Haves
 
**Core Requirements:** 



* 7\\-15 years hands\\-on software engineering experience
* Expert\\-level proficiency in Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, React/Angular
* Experience with Azure cloud services
* Mission\\-critical application experience where failures have serious business consequences
* 3\\-5\\+ years leading engineering teams and managing managers
* **Highly preferable:** 
 Experience with US tolling systems, spend management platforms, or vendor management systems



**The ""Founder/Builder"" Technical DNA:** 



* You've written production code recently—not just reviewed it
* You understand technical debt as business trade\\-offs, not engineering failures
* You've made build\\-vs\\-buy decisions with real budget constraints
* You know how to extract maximum value from lean teams
* You've worked directly with business stakeholders translating technical complexity into business outcomes


 The Role: What You'll Actually Do
 
**Engineering Leadership:** 



* Lead 4 engineering managers and 15\\+ engineers building our Java/Spring Boot/MongoDB/Angular platform
* Own end\\-to\\-end execution: sprint planning → production deployment → customer success
* Make real\\-time technical decisions—architecture reviews, production incidents, feasibility assessments
* Balance feature delivery against technical debt with P\\&L consciousness
* Roll up your sleeves when critical issues need senior technical intervention



**Building World\\-Class Operations:** 



* Implement engineering processes that actually improve velocity
* Establish meaningful metrics: code quality, deployment frequency, incident response, team velocity
* Build/improve CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, deployment automation
* Scale processes from 15 to 50\\+ engineers without creating red tape



**Strategic Partnership:** 



* Report directly to CTO—partner on technical strategy and architecture
* Work closely with CEO on company trajectory and R\\&D transformation
* Translate technical constraints into business language for stakeholders
* Coordinate with US\\-based customers on implementations and integrations



**Technical Transformation:** 



* Consolidate customer\\-specific code branches into unified, maintainable codebase
* Reduce technical debt without stalling feature delivery
* Modernize legacy components while maintaining 99\\.9% uptime
* Build scalable architecture that supports growth without over\\-engineering


 What Success Looks Like
 
**90 Days:** 
 Built team credibility, identified top process improvements, resolved critical technical blockers, established communication rhythms
 



**6 Months:** 
 Measurably improved engineering velocity, technical debt roadmap in execution, high team morale, quick wins delivered
 



**12 Months:** 
 Startup efficiency \\+ enterprise reliability, processes scale to 30\\-50 engineers, solid technical foundation, thinking like a business owner
 


 Must\\-Have Qualities
 
 ✅ Execution obsession – You ship, not just plan ✅ Technical credibility – Engineers respect you because you can do the work ✅ Owner mentality – You think about ROI, customer impact, business outcomes ✅ Comfort with ambiguity – You've operated without perfect processes ✅ Direct communication – You tell it straight ✅ Pragmatic perfectionism – You know when ""good enough now"" beats ""perfect later""
 


 Deal\\-Breakers
 
 ❌ Pure ""process people"" who've never made technical decisions under pressure ❌ Leaders who need perfect information before deciding ❌ Those seeking predictable 9\\-to\\-5 corporate roles ❌ Anyone uncomfortable with hands\\-on technical work when needed ❌ People who create process for process's sake
 


 Why This Is Different
 
**It's Real:** 
 Profitable company, 16 years, real revenue, enterprise customers, mission\\-critical systems, proven product\\-market fit
 



**It's Rare:** 
 Bootstrapped DNA, transformation opportunity, direct CEO/CTO access, no VC pressure or quarterly fire drills
 



**It's Yours to Build:** 
 Autonomy to implement your way, scale team to 50\\+, define engineering culture, career\\-defining impact
 


 What We Offer
 * **Compensation:** 
 ₹40\\-50 LPA (Fixed)
* **Growth:** 
 Direct CEO/CTO partnership, budget for learning, build team from 15 to 50\\+
* **Environment:** 
 On\\-site Hyderabad, sustainable pace, low politics, high ownership
* **Stability:** 
 16\\-year track record, established customer base, predictable revenue


 Tech Stack
 
**Current:** 
 Java, Spring Boot, Angular, MongoDB Atlas, Azure VMs, REST APIs
 



**Where We're Going:** 
 Unified codebase, modern CI/CD, API\\-first architecture, enhanced observability, multi\\-tenant evolution
 


 How to Apply
 
**Email:** 
 careers@smartdocs.ai
 



**Subject:** 
 ""Director of Engineering \\- Hyderabad""
 



**Include:** 



1. **Resume** 
 highlighting entrepreneurial experience, hands\\-on technical work, mission\\-critical applications, founding team collaboration


* **Cover Letter** 
 addressing: Your entrepreneurial journey and what you built
* A critical technical decision with incomplete information
* Process implementation under constraints
* Why SmartDocs, why now?


1. **Optional:** 
 GitHub/GitLab, technical blog, founder reference, problem you're proud of solving


 Final Note
 
 If you're a technical builder who misses startup intensity while wanting stability... If you're experienced enough to implement scalable processes but pragmatic enough to avoid corporate bloat... If you've learned from entrepreneurial experiences and want to apply them to a company with real traction, customers, and revenue... If you think like a business owner and want to be treated like one...
 



**Let's talk.** 




 We're not just hiring an engineering leader. We're looking for a technical partner who thinks about engineering outcomes in terms of business impact, customer success, and company growth.
