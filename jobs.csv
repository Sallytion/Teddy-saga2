 Bigtoe is one of the fastest\\-growing on\\-site wellness platforms in the U.S., built on a modern Laravel \\+ React Native \\+ Next.js stack and powered by a product roadmap that refuses to slow down.
 



  





 We’re looking for an unusually sharp engineer — someone who thinks fast, learns fast, and enjoys solving real, high\\-impact problems without waiting for permission.
 



  





 If you're the kind of person who gets bored easily and wants to work on
 *systems* 
 , not just “tickets”…
 



 keep reading.
 



  





**What This Role Actually Is** 




  





 This is a role for someone who:
 


* likes understanding how entire systems behave, not just components
* can jump between backend, frontend, automation, data, and AI
* enjoys simplifying messy logic
* thinks in first principles
* can build things
 *fast* 
 without breaking mental models
* wants to work directly with a founder who also thinks like an engineer



  





 You won’t be given a narrow box.
 



  





 You will define your own scope by solving the problems that matter most.
 



  





**What You’ll Work On** 




  




* Write backend APIs and improve existing logic paths
* Build small tools that make the whole team 10× faster
* Dive into production issues and instrument root\\-cause insights
* Simplify complex business logic into clean architecture
* Work across React Native \\+ Next.js when needed
* Build internal automations using Python
* Experiment with AI\\-assisted development, embeddings, vector DBs, and agents
* Prototype ideas that we validate fast
* Influence how we structure the system as we scale



  





 If you like being the person who just figures it out, this will feel natural.
 



  





**Who We’re Looking For** 




  





 We don’t care if you know Laravel today.
 



 We don’t care which languages you used at your last job.
 



 We care about:
 


* intelligence
* speed of learning
* clarity of thought
* ability to break down problems
* ownership mindset
* curiosity about how systems work



  





**Ideal background** 




  




* 1–4 years experience (exceptional fresh grads welcome)
* Strong with Python (for tooling \\+ automation)
* Solid in JavaScript; React Native or Next.js exposure helps
* Comfort with APIs, debugging, Git, building things fast
* Built side projects, tools, automations, or apps
* The type of person who can own major parts of a system quickly



  





 If you were the kind of student who understood the
 *why* 
 behind solutions (not just the how)…
 



 If you enjoy solving problems that others avoid…
 



 If you get a kick out of moving fast and making real impact…
 



 You’ll enjoy this role.
 



  





**Why This Role Is Different** 




  




* You’ll work directly with the CEO (IIT, Wharton).
* Your ideas will be implemented — not buried under layers.
* You’ll touch real production architecture, not “toy problems.”
* You won’t be pigeonholed into backend or frontend — everything is on the table.
* You’ll get to operate like a future tech lead / CTO.
* You’ll grow faster here than anywhere else.
* If you want responsibility early in your career, this is it.","Internet Marketplace Platforms","https://www.linkedin.com/company/bigtoe-pose-inc.","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFXlh7NuMbfFg/company-logo_100_100/B4EZsN6q7xHEAQ-/0/1765465043064/bigtoe_pose_inc_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=aq9x7GATxVFT3RSRZ2kSztDSQJqGmc7-2YON4dV0IaY","","","","","","","","","","",""
