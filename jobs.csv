**At ACV we focus on the Health, Physical, Financial, Social and Emotional Wellness of our Teammates and to support this we offer industry leading benefits and wellness programs.**
**Who We Are Looking For**
 Drive Inc, part of the ACV Auctions Group, is looking for a
 *hands\\-on, proactive Engineer IV, Software \\- Test* 
 to elevate quality across our growing engineering organization.
   

  

 We currently have two agile product teams building the future of our automotive marketplace platform — and we’re now forming a third to accelerate delivery. With this expansion, we’re creating a new
 **Engineer IV,** 
**Software \\- Test** 
 role to take ownership for quality across
 *all* 
 teams.
   

  

 This is both a strategic and practical role. You’ll provide leadership, coordination, and mentorship to our Quality Engineers, ensuring we strike the right balance of test coverage, automation, and release confidence across varying priorities and release schedules. You’ll also take responsibility for
 **production quality and service reliability** 
 , helping our teams support users effectively when issues arise in live environments.
   

  

 We’re looking for someone who’s equally comfortable defining strategy and diving into the details — a strong individual contributor who can influence across teams, build better systems, and champion a culture of quality from idea to production.
   

  

**What You Will Do**
* Lead quality across all Drive Inc engineering teams, aligning QA focus with team priorities, release cycles, and business objectives.
* Develop and implement a unified quality strategy that embeds testing, validation, and monitoring into every stage of our development lifecycle.
* Be hands\\-on when needed — designing, writing, and executing functional, integration, and regression tests to reinforce best practices by example.
* Take ownership for quality in production, coordinating post\\-release checks, triaging live issues, overseeing our support desk, and driving continuous improvement through data and feedback.
* Mentor and support the Quality Engineers across teams, ensuring consistent standards, tooling, and knowledge sharing.
* Promote test automation frameworks and CI/CD validation gates, balancing speed and confidence in every release.
* Collaborate with Product and Engineering Leads to identify quality risks, ensure readiness for release, and improve test coverage where it matters most.
* Build a feedback loop from production to product, working with Support and Ops to translate live issues into actionable improvements.
* Measure and communicate quality performance, helping teams and stakeholders understand risk, coverage, and impact.
* Drive continuous learning — fostering a culture where quality is a shared responsibility and live issues lead to better systems, not blame.


**What You Will Need**
* 5\\+ years’ experience in QA roles, with at least 2 years in a lead or senior capacity in a fast\\-moving agile environment.
* Strong hands\\-on testing skills across functional, integration, and regression layers.
* Experience coordinating QA work across multiple squads or product areas.
* Good knowledge of automation tools such as Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, Appium, or Webdriver.io.
* Understanding of CI/CD pipelines, quality gates, and automated test integration.
* Good SQL and API testing skills; confident diagnosing issues from logs or data.
* Experience leading post\\-release validation or live quality monitoring.
* Excellent collaboration and communication skills — able to translate technical quality risks into clear business impacts.
* Passion for mentoring others, improving processes, and making quality measurable and actionable.
* A pragmatic mindset: you care about shipping great software, not just writing test scripts.


**Bonus points**
* Familiarity with AWS\\-based architectures and cloud\\-native application testing.
* Experience with observability and incident management tools (CloudWatch, Sentry, Datadog, etc.).
* Exposure to marketplace or transactional platform environments.
* Experience with BDD, Gherkin, and facilitating UAT or sprint demos.
* Background in service delivery, SRE, or production operations.


**Why this role matters**
 Drive Inc is scaling fast within the ACV Auctions Group, building the technology that powers our next\\-generation automotive marketplace across Europe and beyond. As our Quality Lead, you’ll ensure that speed never comes at the cost of reliability. You’ll shape how our teams think about testing, empower QAs to do their best work, and ensure our users get the quality experience they expect — both before and after every release.
   

  

 If you’re passionate about building a quality culture, improving systems, and making a tangible impact on product reliability, this is your opportunity to lead quality for one of the fastest\\-moving teams in the ACV Auctions Group.
   

  

 Our Values
   

  

 Trust \\& Transparency \\| People First \\| Positive Experiences \\| Calm Persistence \\| Never Settling
