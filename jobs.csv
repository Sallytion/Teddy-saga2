We’re building the future of identity verification in the United States replacing a clunky, ineffective, and expensive status quo with solutions that are 10x faster, smarter, and more accurate.
   

  

 We’ve seen tremendous traction and are growing extremely quickly. Our real\\-time APIs have helped verify hundreds of millions of identities, starting with financial services and rapidly expanding into new markets. SentiLink is backed by world\\-class investors including Craft Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, NYCA, and Max Levchin.
   

  

 We’ve earned recognition from TechCrunch, CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Business Insider, PYMNTS, American Banker, LendIt, and have been named to the Forbes Fintech 50 list every year since 2023\\. Last but not least, we’ve even made history \\- we were the first company to go live with the eCBSV and testified before the United States House of Representatives on the future of identity.
   

  

 SentiLink supports a variety of ways to work, ranging from fully remote to in\\-office. We operate as a digital\\-first company with strong collaboration across the U.S. and India.

If you’re ready to design high\\-quality solutions, influence our technology roadmap, and make a lasting impact on our product’s success, we want to meet you!
   

  

 This is an in\\-office position based in Gurugram, India.
