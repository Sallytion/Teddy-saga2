**About Stripe**
 Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.
   

  

**About The Team**
 Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early\\-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.
   

  

 What you’ll do
   

  

 As a company, we believe in end\\-to\\-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open\\-source software.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Work on cross\\-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
* Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
* Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
* Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills


 Who you are
   

  

 We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
   

  

**Minimum Requirements**
* A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2026, or equivalent work experience
* Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
* Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi\\-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
* Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts


**Preferred Qualifications**
* One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
* Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
* Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases


 In\\-office expectations
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in\\-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in\\-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.
   

  

 Pay and benefits
   

  

 Stripe does not yet include pay ranges in job postings in every country. Stripe strongly values pay transparency and is working toward pay transparency globally.","Software Development, Financial Services, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/stripe","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQE2ZfJyfn-VCg/company-logo_100_100/B56ZlyKwpUKIAQ-/0/1758557047806/stripe_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=fRMcaMGPJNFUMq_l1f2zzyX4PaK3yg-MRicyUuY3qSI","","","","","","","","","","",""

 🧬
 



 Today over 1\\.78 million of small and medium\\-sized businesses in Europe alone need to be compliant with information security frameworks to be able to sell their products and services to enterprise customers.
 



 Secfix automates security compliance for SMBs in Europe. We help SMBs automate ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks instead of months. Our platform integrates with a company’s tech stack (like AWS, Azure AD, Jira, etc.), automatically extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain compliant.
 



 We grew fast and are looking for skilled engineers to help us improve and scale our product. Check our culture guide.
 



  





**Why you should join Secfix** 




 Secfix is an early\\-stage fully remote startup in the best sense of the word. We’re a fun, close\\-knit team on a mission to become the European compliance automation leader.
 



 We grew from 0 revenue to \\>1M$ ARR within two years and most of our costs are already covered by revenue. Now we are looking to grow further and faster.
 



 Our trajectory is backed by top investors (4\\.4M$ raised), including Octopus Ventures, Neosfer (Commerzbank), founders of Signavio and many more angels.
 



 As a Senior Backend Engineer, you will help shape and build every product we deliver to real customers: CTOs, COOs and engineering teams of small and medium businesses. You will also be part of growing a high\\-performance fully remote software startup.
 



  





**Who are we looking for?** 




 We're building an environment at Secfix where ambitious, independent engineers can thrive. We want to grow with people who take pride in building actual products, who are curious about how the features we ship are used daily — and who bring a design\\-first mindset (plan before coding) to ensure scalable, maintainable systems. We own products and outcomes, not Jira tickets.
 



 We understand that startup life can be demanding, but we believe it doesn’t have to be stressful. Bring your commitment and drive to grow, and we’ll deliver an environment that keeps you happy, healthy, and empowered to do your best work with us.
 



  





 You 
 **should** 
  apply if:
 


* You’re ambitious, independent and growth\\-oriented
* You’re comfortable with startup life ambiguity, adapting to changing priorities based on customer and market feedback, and wearing multiple hats
* You bring senior talent to our team with 5\\+ years of equivalent experience
* You’re comfortable collaborating and communicating in a remote environment, especially in writing and with Loom. You understand that working independently doesn't mean working alone. Remember, it requires more pro\\-active communication than working in the office
* You can mentor other developers and do code reviews.
* You know how to balance speed and quality and how to build leverage in your work through automation, abstractions and good software design and architecture
* You’re excited not only to use AI tools like Cursor, or Claude Code consciously — not just for speed, but for better design, refactoring, and testing but also building AI tools.



  





 You 
 **should not apply** 
 if:
 


* You need a lot of processes to tell you what to do or you're comfortable only picking up tickets from a JIRA board
* You are not disciplined and organized in how you document and communicate your work with collegues
* You only want to write code and don’t really care about the bigger picture and customers
* You don’t want to test, deploy, monitor and troubleshoot your own code
* You don’t want to lead your own projects, but rather be led by someone else
* You don't want to collaborate closely with other areas of the business or engage with users when needed



  





**What you’ll do day\\-to\\-day** 



* You’ll be the go\\-to person for all things backend in your product area
* You’ll work closely with the CTO and the Tech Lead to set technical direction
* You’ll work closely with our product and design teams and with our customers to identify, plan, design, build and ship features on schedule
* You’ll deploy, monitor, troubleshoot, debug, support, maintain and evolve features and code under your responsibility
* You’ll leverage AI\\-powered engineering tools (Cursor, Claude, etc.) to accelerate development, debugging, and testing.
* You’ll own and maintain product and technical documentation
* You’ll support other team members on your area of expertise, mentor and develop junior engineers
* You’ll follow company's culture and communication guidelines
* Live by 
 
 our values



  





**What you’ll need** 



* 5\\-8 years of of industry experience as a backend or product engineer, building user\\-facing products:
* Strong object oriented programming fundamentals in Java
* Spring Boot, Hibernate (or equivalent) experience
* Relational Database Design and SQL optimisation
* Testing, monitoring and troubleshooting
* Ability to design and build backend systems that can scale both in supported features and concurrent usage
* Previous experience with Golang and/or Typescript is a bonus
* Experience with owning features end\\-to\\-end, from idea to execution to delivery in production
* Experience with communicating software design ideas and adapting to feedback before jumping into coding
* Extensive experience with AI\\-powered engineering tools (Cursor, Claude), you know their strengths, weaknesses, and how to validate outputs.



  





**Preferred (bonus)** 



* Experience working at fully remote companies
* Experience working on early stage startups
* Built functional AI features (especially if deployed to production) or integrated AI with backend systems.
* 0\\.5\\-1 year of software engineering experience in top tier tech companies (FAANG, Uber, Atlassian or similar), hedge funds (Towers Research, DE Shaw or similar) or VC\\-funded startups.
