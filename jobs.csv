 Lead Software Development Engineer, Strum AI
   

  

 At Strum AI, we’re reimagining the technology that powers global supply chains with an AI\\-first approach.
   

  

 Today, most supply chains still rely on Excel or legacy enterprise tools that take months—and millions of
   

  

 dollars—to implement. Our mission is to lower that barrier, making modern forecasting, inventory, and
   

  

 planning capabilities accessible in days, not months, for businesses of any size.
   

  

 As a founding engineer, you’ll work directly with the founders (former Amazon supply chain and
   

  

 technology leaders) to build the core product from the ground up—spanning LLMs, optimization,
   

  

 simulations, agent\\-driven workflows, and a reimagined product experience that tightly connects data,
   

  

 insights, and action. We are hiring a Lead Developer to be the technical backbone of Strum AI. This
   

  

 person will own system architecture end\\-to\\-end and lead the build\\-out of our backend platform, agent
   

  

 framework, and the interaction layer that brings decision intelligence into the flow of work. This is
   

  

 a hands\\-on, founding\\-level role. You will design the system, write critical code, influence product UX,
   

  

 and make architectural decisions that will shape the company.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
  Platform Architecture: Design and own Strum AI’s core architecture across data ingestion,
   

  

 modeling services, agent workflows, APIs, and UI integration
   

  

  Agentic Workflow Engine: Build the agent framework that powers simulations, decision support,
   

  

 and automated workflows; Design reusable action blocks (e.g., query forecast, run optimization,
   

  

 simulate scenarios, trigger downstream actions)
   

  

  Backend \\& APIs: Build production\\-grade backend services (Python\\-first); Develop APIs
   

  

 supporting probabilistic forecasts, inventory optimization, simulations, and what\\-if analysis
   

  

  Frontend \\& Product Interaction: Help reimagine the frontend by bringing Bring a strong
   

  

 product intuition to data\\-heavy, decision\\-intelligence workflows; while you don’t need to be a
   

  

 frontend specialist, you should be comfortable shipping meaningful UI code and shaping API–UI
   

  

 contract
   

  

  Data \\& Systems: Help define and evolve Strum’s canonical supply\\-chain data model; Build
   

  

 ingestion pipelines that handle messy enterprise data and schema drift
   

  

 What We’re Looking For
   

  

**Required**
  8\\+ years of professional software engineering experience
   

  

  Strong backend and systems design experience
   

  

  Production\\-grade Python expertise
   

  

  Experience building distributed systems, platforms, or workflow engines
   

  

  Ability to operate with ambiguity and incomplete requirements
   

  

 Strong Plus
   

  

  Experience building and scaling SaaS products end\\-to\\-end
   

  

  Experience with machine learning, optimization, LLMs, agent frameworks
