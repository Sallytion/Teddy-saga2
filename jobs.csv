 We’re reimagining the
 **core intelligence layer for education** 
 —tackling one of the most ambitious challenges in AI:
 **subjective assessment automation and ultra\\-personalized learning at scale.** 




 This isn’t just another LLM application. We’re building a
 **first\\-principles AI reasoning engine combining multi\\-modal learning, dynamic knowledge graphs, and real\\-time content generation** 
 . The goal? To eliminate billions of wasted hours in manual evaluation and create an
 **AI that understands how humans learn** 
 .
 



 As a
 **Founding AI Engineer** 
 , you’ll define and build this system from the ground up. You’ll work on problems few have attempted, at the
 **bleeding edge of LLMs, computer vision, and generative reasoning.** 




  





**What You’ll Be Solving:** 




  




* **Handwriting OCR at near\\-human accuracy:** 
 How can we push vision\\-language models to understand messy, real\\-world input from students?
* **Real\\-time learner knowledge modeling:** 
 Can AI track and reason about what someone knows—and how they’re learning—moment to moment?
* **Generative AI that teaches:** 
 How do we create dynamic video lessons that evolve in sync with a learner’s knowledge state?
* **Scalable inference infrastructure:** 
 How do we optimize LLMs and multimodal models to support millions of learners in real time?



  





**What You’ll Be Building:** 




  




* Architect, deploy \\& optimize multi\\-modal AI systems—OCR, knowledge\\-state inference, adaptive content generation.
* Build reasoning engines that combine LLMs, retrieval, and learner data to dynamically guide learning.
* Fine\\-tune foundation models (LLMs, VLMs) and implement cutting\\-edge techniques (quantization, LoRA, RAG, etc.).
* Design production\\-grade AI systems: modular, scalable, and optimized for inference at global scale.
* Lead experiments at the frontier of AI research, publishing if desired.



  





**Tech Stack \\& Skills** 




  




* Must\\-Have:
* Deep expertise in AI/ML, with a focus on LLMs, multi\\-modal learning, and computer vision.
* Hands\\-on experience with OCR fine\\-tuning and handwritten text recognition
* Strong proficiency in AI frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, OpenCV.
* Experience in optimizing AI for production: LLM quantization, retrieval augmentation, and MLOps.
* Knowledge graphs and AI\\-driven reasoning systems experience
* Nice\\-to\\-Have:
* Experience with Diffusion Models, Transformers, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
* Expertise in vector databases, real\\-time inference pipelines, and low\\-latency AI deployment.
* Prior experience in ed\\-tech, adaptive learning AI, or multi\\-modal content generation.



  





**Why This Role Is Rare** 




  




* **Define the AI stack** 
 for a category\\-defining product at inception.
* **Work with deep ownership** 
 across research, engineering, and infrastructure.
* **Founding\\-level equity and influence in a high\\-growth** 
 company solving a $100B\\+ problem.
* **Balance** 
 of cutting\\-edge research and real\\-world deployment.
* **Solve problems that matter** 
 —not just academically, but in people’s lives.



  





**Who this role is for** 




 This is for builders at the edge—engineers who want to architect, not just optimize. Researchers who want their ideas shipped.If you want to:
 


* Push LLMs, CV, and multimodal models to their performance limits.
* Build AI that learns, reasons, and adapts like a human tutor.
* Shape the foundational AI layer for education","Education","https://in.linkedin.com/company/crazygoldfish","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEZl5fhLhK6bg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1723831173060/crazygoldfish_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=BaBFzGvWUv1PjAETF84iUW-V6RgLp6TQs5Ox5k35KXY","","","","","","","","","","",""
