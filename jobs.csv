"li-4374664823","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4374664823","","Web Developer","CometChat","Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","","fulltime","","","","","",False,"mid-senior level","Marketing","","","**Our Mission**
 Fuel customer growth through meaningful, intelligent, and safe user\\-to\\-user (and now, user\\-to\\-agent) engagement.
   

  

**CometChat Overview**
 CometChat is a full\\-stack conversational platform built to unify every layer of interaction — bringing together real\\-time conversations (chat, messaging, voice, and video), AI Agents, moderation, notifications, and analytics in one modular, developer\\-first solution.
   

  

 Our company has seen rapid growth, thanks to several market validations — including our participation in Techstars Boulder Accelerator in 2019, followed by investments from experienced investors such as iSeed Ventures, Range Ventures, Silicon Badia, and Matchstick Ventures. CometChat raised a Series A round from Signal Peak Ventures, bringing our total funding to $16M.
   

  

 We believe the interface of the future is conversation — not clicks. Every app will soon have an AI layer that’s as native as text messaging today. That’s why we’re building the infrastructure for the world’s AI\\-powered conversations — from human\\-to\\-human, to human\\-to\\-agent, to multi\\-party collaboration with AI in the mix.
   

  

 From AI onboarding assistants that get users productive in minutes, to copilots that perform complex workflows in\\-app, to intelligent moderators that protect and guide communities in real time — our AI Agent platform makes it all possible.
   

  

 With CometChat’s ready\\-to\\-use UI kits, powerful SDKs, and our Full Stack AI Agent Platform, product teams across startups and enterprises can launch safe, scalable, and smart in\\-app interactions faster than ever.
   

  

**Why Join Us Now**
 We’re at the tipping point where AI becomes a native part of every conversation. At CometChat, you’ll help shape a future where users can talk to their apps as naturally as to a friend — where agents think, reason, act, and collaborate with humans in real time.
   

  

 You won’t just be joining a product team — you’ll be building the standard for AI interaction layers: agent\\-aware UI, intelligent guardrails, rich actions libraries, and multi\\-party collaboration between people and AI.
   

  

 If you want to help define how the next billion users will communicate — and push the boundaries of what’s possible in real\\-time, AI\\-powered engagement — we’d love to work with you.
   

  

**What We Mean By AI\\-native**
 AI\\-native here means you build with agents by default. We expect
 **100% of the code to be generated via agentic tools** 
 (Cursor, Claude Code, and similar), while you own everything that actually matters: problem framing, architecture, tradeoffs, review quality, tests, performance, and security. This is not “vibe coding.” The code is generated. The thinking is yours. You should be great at steering agents, validating output, catching subtle issues early, and debugging code you did not manually write.
   

  

**Why AI\\-native**
 Software development is changing permanently, and we are leaning all the way in. You will work in a team that ships fast with agents, where your leverage comes from judgment and systems thinking rather than typing speed. You will get
 **access to whatever AI tools you need** 
 (Cursor, Claude Code, or anything else that makes you effective), and the freedom to use them aggressively. If you want to operate at the edge of how modern engineering gets done and level up your output, this role is built for that.
   

  

**Join us to build where AI meets human connection.**
**Work Location**
 In our Chennai India Office.
   

  

**Position Overview \\& Priorities**
 We are hiring a Website Engineer to own and improve the CometChat website as a product.
   

  

 CometChat powers in\\-app chat, voice, video, and AI agents for thousands of apps worldwide. Our website is where developers first experience that story. It has to be fast, technically sharp, and structurally sound \\- because our audience is technical.
   

  

 You will sit within the marketing team and own the web layer end to end \\- architecture, performance, technical SEO, CMS structure, and UX quality. If you care about clean systems, performance, and building something that directly impacts growth, this role gives you real responsibility and clear ownership from day one.
   

  

 Our stack:
   

  

* Svelte/React Js
* Storyblok
* Headless architecture
* Analytics \\+ SEO\\-driven workflows


 What you will own
   

  

* Develop and maintain the marketing website
* Build new pages, components, and content structures
* Improve site performance and Core Web Vitals
* Ensure technical SEO hygiene (schema, crawlability, sitemaps, canonical structure)
* Maintain clean CMS models and scalable content architecture
* Implement structured data (JSON\\-LD) correctly
* Manage redirects and URL structure
* Work closely with marketing to ship landing pages quickly
* Proactively identify UX and performance improvements
* Keep the website fast, clean, and stable


 This role is about ownership \\- not just implementation.
   

  

 What we are looking for
   

  

 Must have
   

  

* 2\\-4 years of production frontend experience
* Experience with component\\-based frameworks (Svelte preferred)
* Experience integrating a headless CMS
* Understanding of technical SEO:
+ Schema markup
+ Core Web Vitals
+ Structured internal linking
+ SSR vs CSR implications

* Experience shipping and maintaining live production websites
* Strong JavaScript fundamentals
* Comfort working independently


 Good to have
   

  

* Experience with Storyblok
* Experience with marketing or content\\-heavy sites
* Familiarity with analytics implementation
* Basic understanding of accessibility best practices


 Why this role matters
   

  

 Our website is one of our highest\\-leverage assets. It drives discovery, evaluation, and revenue. It’s not just a set of pages \\- it is core infrastructure.
   

  

 You won’t just ship pages \\- you will shape how developers discover, evaluate, and trust us. You will own performance, structure, and technical quality end to end. If you care about clean architecture, fast experiences, and building something that compounds over time, this role gives you real impact without layers of bureaucracy.
   

  

**Here are the values that act as a guardrail of our execution culture:**
**Go above and beyond for the customer:** 
 We are obsessed with ensuring every customer is taken care of, no matter how big or small they are. We truly believe their problems are our problems, and will stop at next to nothing to see them succeed.
   

  

**Be relentless:** 
 Never stop innovating. Be relentless in trying new things, and improving our product. Challenge the status quo, embrace learning curves, and don’t be afraid to fail. Focus on the outcome and everything else will fall into place.
   

  

**Be curious:** 
 Practice empathy. Anticipate customer needs, and solve them before they get there. If you don’t understand something, ask questions and learn.
   

  

**Have fun:** 
 Laugh. Be positive and kind. Make people feel good. Life is too short to not spend time doing what you love with folks you enjoy being around.
   

  

**Interview Process**
 Our goal is to make sure you have the chance to get to know CometChat as we learn more about you. Through a series of conversations with CometChat’s founders and key stakeholders, we’ll want to learn more about your strategic and functional expertise, and your passion. We hope that you’ll bring questions and ideas to each conversation and suggest ways that we can get to know you and your capabilities better.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cometchat","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C510BAQHPG420VJc-Cw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630569652455?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=2G9LboBQHwCISuPmMg0IR6fSKNW-BMzfk2kxfHIgA2A","","","","","","","","","","",""
