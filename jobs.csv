**About Sitetracker**
 Sitetracker was founded ten years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
   

  

 However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full\\-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.
   

  

 We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the \\#2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people\\-first culture.","Software Development and IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/sitetracker","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQGc32DDsZv3tg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1654642587392/sitetracker_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0P62jdqhEGTY_DksZCElhWHK7TuGhfT8SsXfDbKm6Qo","","","","","","","","","","",""
