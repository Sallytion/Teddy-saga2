 internal teams to better understand and improve security posture.
 



  





 You will operate at the intersection of big data, distributed computing, cloud technologies, and infrastructure as code. Our existing stacks include both
 



 custom\\-built and open source components written in Python, Go, or Java, deployed within Amazon Web Services. We leverage Kubernetes and other
 



 containerized platforms. Major components include Kafka, Elasticsearch, Databricks, and Spark, along with additional custom application services
 



 developed in\\-house.

 year we hold a department\\-wide Hackathon, teaming up across all R\\&D teams over four days to collaborate and build cool ideas outside the normal project
 



 scope. While innovation and experimentation is the focus, some of these ideas do make it into our products.
 



  





**About You** 




 You’re an experienced technical leader who enjoys solving complex, ambiguous technical challenges with little to no guidance. You care deeply about
