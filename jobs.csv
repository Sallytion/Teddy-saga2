 Lots of tech companies disrupt. But, many fail when they try to scale. We're different. CockroachDB makes it easier for companies to build and scale apps. This is how and why we're helping some of the most innovative companies on the planet. We tackle problems head\\-on and focus on solutions that create lasting impact.
   

  

 Because when our customers win, we all win.
   

  

**The Role**
 An essential role within our Professional Services team, our Staff Enterprise Architects help customers fully realize the technical and business benefits of CockroachDB. We believe that in order for an Enterprise Architect to be successful, they must understand every part of the database and its context, including modern and legacy deployment tools and systems, both on premise and in the cloud, the surrounding infrastructure stack, and produce reusable artifacts that demonstrate strengths and disseminate the information, while balancing both reactive and proactive activities.
   

  

**While this role is remote, you must be based in India to be eligible for this role.**
**You Will**
* Own and deliver expert technical guidance and assistance to our customers during their planning, design, testing, migration, and implementation efforts as they modernize both their legacy SQL applications and new, next generation applications.
* Utilize your deep technical skills to provide measurable value to customers and drive sales growth.
* Educate customers on the unique capabilities of CockroachDB and design solutions to meet a wide variety of challenges.
* Drive adoption and implementation of Cockroach Labs tools/features by leading requirements and design sessions, migration analysis and strategy, performance analysis and tuning, hands\\-on product and technical workshop sessions

* As a member of the Revenue organization, you will partner with members of the Sales and Customer Success teams in driving new business opportunities and expanding adoption in existing customer organizations.
* Develop and implement best practices, processes and tools which can continually enhance Cockroach Labs’s Professional Services offerings.


**The Expectations**
 In your first 30 days, you will learn about CockroachDB and figure out where the product would be a good fit and for which use cases. During this time, we also believe it’s important for you to establish internal relationships across sales, product, and engineering to be able to effectively navigate resources to help you in your efforts with customers.
   

  

 After 60 days, you will be leading customer engagements, including design, testing, identifying refactoring opportunities, designing migration strategies, datebase implementation methods, and executing on solution deployment. As you continue to grow in the role, you will be moving into owning best practices and industry solutions, developing reusable artifacts supporting the organization's growth and intellectual property. The artifact creation and re\\-use are key to help both pre and post sales activities.

 Platform Engineer (Ontology / Data)
   

  

 Type: Full\\-time
   

  

* Founding R\\&D Team
* Onsite


 Reports to: CTO
   

  

 Function: Ontology, Data Infrastructure, Agent Context Systems
   

  

**About The Role**
 You’ll build the nervous system for the Post\\-AGI era of engineering — the ontology and data
   

  

 infrastructure that connects intelligent agents, humans, and organizations.
   

  

 This is not a maintenance role — it’s a frontier R\\&D challenge to design data systems that can think, adapt,
   

  

 and evolve.
   

  

 Your mission is to create a living data architecture where each dataset and relationship fuels the
   

  

 intelligence of autonomous systems. You will lay the groundwork for self\\-learning, interdependent AI
   

  

 agents that can collaborate, reason, and build autonomously.
   

  

 If you believe the next generation of engineers should build for perpetuity, not for product cycles — this role
   

  

 is for you.
   

  

**What You’ll Build**
 Ontology Framework: Model real\\-world systems into structured, dynamic, and self\\-adapting
   

  

 entities.
   

  

 Data Pipelines for Intelligence: Build real\\-time ingestion and feedback systems powering agentic
   

  

 reasoning.
   

  

 Context APIs: Create seamless access to memory and state across agents.
   

  

 Observability \\& Lineage: Design systems that can explain every decision taken by an AI agent.
   

  

 Self\\-evolving Models: Architect data structures that learn and adapt with feedback over time.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
 Design and evolve the ontology core for distributed agent ecosystems.
   

  

 Build dynamic, scalable, and ethical data pipelines.
   

  

 Architect context persistence and retrieval mechanisms for agent networks.
   

  

 Collaborate with AI and system engineers to define data\\-driven intelligence.
   

  

**Tech Stack**
 Core: Python, Go, TypeScript
   

  

 Data Systems: Kafka, Spark, Postgres, ElasticSearch
   

  

 Cloud: AWS/GCP, Kubernetes, Docker
   

  

 ML Ops: Airflow, MLflow, Neo4j, graph\\-based data models
   

  

 Bonus: Ontology engineering, schema evolution, or self\\-healing data systems.
   

  

**What Success Looks Like**
 Unified ontology powering autonomous agents by Day 90\\.
   

  

 Dynamic data pipelines achieving near\\-zero latency.
   

  

 Data lineage dashboards showcasing complete transparency.
   

  

 Ontology evolution driven by real\\-time feedback.
   

  

**Who Thrives Here**
 Builders who think like biologists — obsessed with emergence and evolution.
   

  

 Engineers who want to define how machines will understand the world after AGI.
   

  

 Researchers who see data as a living organism, not a static asset.
   

  

 People who believe the future of AI is not automation — it’s co\\-creation.
