 Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.
   

  

 Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third\\-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.
   

  

 Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1\\.4B\\+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.
   

  

 We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.
   

  

**About The Team**
 The Payments platform team's mission is to move money quickly and reliably across countries and currencies. As one of Rippling's most mission\\-critical systems, we're responsible for moving tens of billions of dollars annually, with much of it for Payroll, which caters to millions of employees in over 40 countries. Other products that exclusively use the Payments platform include Tax Platform, Billing, Bill Pay, and Travel, among others. Our ultimate goal is for all money moved through Rippling to be orchestrated by our platform.
   

  

 Rippling's global expansion is largely dependent on the payment rails we offer. For instance, Payroll can only expand to onboard employees in New Zealand if our platform can move money from USD to NZD. This involves integrating with FX vendors, banks (like Citi or JPM), and third\\-party fintech solutions (like Nium or Airwallex).
   

  

 As a platform, we put incredible emphasis on reliability, especially since our features depend on third\\-party systems. We process close to 1 million transactions within a few hours during peak times, and even a single dropped or delayed payment can mean an employee doesn't get their paycheck on time. That's why our team takes pride in what we've built and holds a very high bar for reliability. Fault tolerance and scalability are a core part of our design phase, not an afterthought. For engineers looking to create a tangible business impact and step up to a big challenge, this team is one of the best places to be.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Are you looking to be in a role where you can have a significant impact on the company's growth and success? Does the prospect of making the most pragmatic technical decisions, which will drastically shape the future of the products excite you? Our Finance Platform org is looking for a seasoned

* Manage and enhance integrations with Payroll, Tax Platform and other product teams to make sure we develop new functionalities while keeping a high bar for system extensibility and reliability.
* Lead incident response and on\\-call responsibilities as an incident commander for Payment platform, performing postmortem analysis across multiple stacks and driving action items to completion to prevent future failures.

* Mentor junior engineers and drive engineering excellence standards around code quality, testing and system reliability across the team.

 Lead Software Development Engineer, Strum AI
   

  

 At Strum AI, we’re reimagining the technology that powers global supply chains with an AI\\-first approach.
   

  

 Today, most supply chains still rely on Excel or legacy enterprise tools that take months—and millions of
   

  

 dollars—to implement. Our mission is to lower that barrier, making modern forecasting, inventory, and
   

  

 planning capabilities accessible in days, not months, for businesses of any size.
   

  

 As a founding engineer, you’ll work directly with the founders (former Amazon supply chain and
   

  

 technology leaders) to build the core product from the ground up—spanning LLMs, optimization,
   

  

 simulations, agent\\-driven workflows, and a reimagined product experience that tightly connects data,
   

  

 insights, and action. We are hiring a Lead Developer to be the technical backbone of Strum AI. This
   

  

 person will own system architecture end\\-to\\-end and lead the build\\-out of our backend platform, agent
   

  

 framework, and the interaction layer that brings decision intelligence into the flow of work. This is
   

  

 a hands\\-on, founding\\-level role. You will design the system, write critical code, influence product UX,
   

  

 and make architectural decisions that will shape the company.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
  Platform Architecture: Design and own Strum AI’s core architecture across data ingestion,
   

  

 modeling services, agent workflows, APIs, and UI integration

 Lead Software Development Engineer, Strum AI
   

  

 At Strum AI, we’re reimagining the technology that powers global supply chains with an AI\\-first approach.

 dollars—to implement. Our mission is to lower that barrier, making modern forecasting, inventory, and
   

  

 planning capabilities accessible in days, not months, for businesses of any size.
   

  

 As a founding engineer, you’ll work directly with the founders (former Amazon supply chain and
   

  

 technology leaders) to build the core product from the ground up—spanning LLMs, optimization,
   

  

 simulations, agent\\-driven workflows, and a reimagined product experience that tightly connects data,
   

  

 insights, and action. We are hiring a Lead Developer to be the technical backbone of Strum AI. This
   

  

 person will own system architecture end\\-to\\-end and lead the build\\-out of our backend platform, agent
   

  

 framework, and the interaction layer that brings decision intelligence into the flow of work. This is
   

  

 a hands\\-on, founding\\-level role. You will design the system, write critical code, influence product UX,
