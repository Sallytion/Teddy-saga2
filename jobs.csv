**Start Your Career Building Systems That Matter**




 Skip the mundane CRUD apps and enterprise bureaucracy. Join us straight out of college to build AI\\-powered intelligence platforms that help law enforcement solve crimes, analyze complex data patterns, and keep communities safe.
 



 We're hiring 3\\-4 exceptional engineers from the 2025 graduating batch. You'll work remotely with a distributed team across Asia, shipping real features from day one, not spending months in ""training programs"" watching videos.
 



  





**What You'll Actually Do**



* **Write real code that ships to production** 
 \\- No sandbox environments or fake projects. You'll contribute to live systems within your first month.
* **Build with modern tech** 
 \\- Work with Go, Python, graph databases (NebulaGraph), real\\-time analytics (ClickHouse), vector search, and AI APIs.
* **Own features end\\-to\\-end** 
 \\- From design to deployment. We'll give you context and support, but you'll have real autonomy.
* **Learn fast** 
 \\- You'll be challenged, make mistakes, and grow quickly. We believe in learning by doing, not by watching.
* **Solve meaningful problems** 
 \\- Intelligence platforms, data pipelines, API gateways, not another e\\-commerce checkout flow.



  





**What We're Looking For**




**Academic baseline:** 



* 2025 graduating batch (BE/B.Tech/MCA in Computer Science or related fields)
* 70%\\+ in 10th and 12th grades
* 8\\+ CGPA in college



  





**What actually matters:** 



* You can code in
 **Python, Go, or JavaScript** 
 (we care more about how you think than which language you know)
* You're comfortable
 **using AI tools** 
 to code faster and learn quicker
* You've built something—college projects, hackathons, open source contributions, personal projects (show us your GitHub!)
* You can
 **learn independently** 
 and don't need hand\\-holding
* You communicate clearly in English (we're remote—writing matters)
* You're
 **genuinely curious** 
 about tech and excited to build things



  





**Bonus points:** 



* Built REST APIs or worked with databases
* Contributed to open source projects
* Won hackathons or competitive programming contests
* Experience with Linux, Docker, or cloud platforms



  





**Why Join S2T**




**Real Impact from Day One:** 
 You won't spend 6 months in training. You'll ship code in week one and own real features by month two.
 



**Learn by Building:** 
 Work on challenging problems with modern technologies. We'll support your growth, but you'll learn fastest by actually building things.
 



**Remote \\+ Autonomy:** 
 Work from anywhere in India. We trust you to deliver results and manage your time. No pointless standups or micromanagement.
 



**Transparent Culture:** 
 We share context openly. You'll understand
 *why* 
 we're building what we're building, not just
 *what* 
 to build.
 



**Meaningful Work:** 
 Intelligence platforms that help solve crimes and keep people safe. Your code will have real\\-world impact beyond ad clicks or engagement metrics.
 



  





**Our Values**



* **Transparent Velocity:** 
 Move fast, share context openly, no hidden agendas or politics
* **Compound Ownership:** 
 Own your work, think long\\-term, build for quality not quick fixes
* **Context Over Control:** 
 We give you the why and the what, you figure out the how
* **Collective Excellence:** 
 We grow together, help each other, and win as a team
* **Customer Truth:** 
 Real impact over vanity metrics and feature theater



  





**Compensation \\& Terms**




**Probation (First 6 months):** 
 ₹35,000\\-70,000/month based on skills and interview performance
 



**Post\\-Probation:** 
 ₹50,000\\-90,000/month based on performance and impact
 



**What's included:** 
 Salary only, no additional benefits during this initial phase. We're a bootstrapped, profitable company focused on sustainable growth, not VC\\-funded perks that disappear after Series A.
