But unlike software (with observability platforms such as AppDynamics and Datadog), construction teams lack automated feedback loops to help projects stay on schedule and on budget. Without this observability, construction wastes a whopping $3T per year because glitches aren’t detected fast enough to recover.
   

  

 Doxel AI exists to bring computer vision to construction, so the industry can deliver what society needs to thrive. From hospitals to data centers, from foreman to VPs of construction, teams use Doxel to make better decisions everyday. In fact, Doxel has contributed to the construction of the facilities that provide many of the products and services you use everyday.
   

  

 We have LLM\\-driven automation, classic computer vision, deep learning ML object detection, a low\\-latency 3D three.js web app, and a complex data pipeline powering it all in the background. We’re building out new workflows, analytics dashboards, and forecasting engines. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
   

  

 We're at an exciting stage of scale as we build upon our growing market momentum. Our software is trusted by Shell Oil, Genentech, HCA healthcare, Kaiser, Turner, Layton and several others. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
   

  

**The Role**
 A Senior SDET with Doxel is driving quality in next\\-generation, local\\-first web applications. You'll be leading test automation efforts across real\\-time and batch data processing and interactive frontends to ensure reliability and performance. If you're passionate about shift\\-left testing, automation, and embedding rigorous validation at every stage, this role is for you.
   

  

 You will define and implement Doxel’s test automation strategy, ensuring scalability and reliability across frontend, backend, and data pipelines. Your expertise in CI/CD integration, performance testing, and security validation will enable seamless execution of AI\\-driven analytics, 360\\-degree video processing, and massive dataset handling. Your work will empower construction teams with precise, real\\-time decision\\-making tools.
   

  

**Who You Are**
 You are obsessed with preventing issues before they arise, ensuring robust automation and infrastructure. You excel in complex systems, balancing client\\-side computation, real\\-time data, and backend integrations. You champion developer autonomy, mentor engineers, and build automation frameworks that enhance velocity without sacrificing reliability.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* Own and scale test automation across frontend, backend, and data pipelines to support fast, reliable releases
* Develop UI and API test suites that push the limits of performance using Three.js, DuckDb, and WebAssembly
* Streamline CI/CD, integrating automated regression, load, and chaos testing for dependable deployments
* Create and refine greenfield regression suites that evolve with the product
* Embed automation early, ensuring testing accelerates development instead of slowing it down
* Guide and support engineers in building a strong testing culture with practical, scalable best practices


**What You Bring To Doxel**
* 4\\+ years in test automation frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, PyTest, Jest, JUnit)
* 6\\+ years of hands\\-on coding in TypeScript, Python, or Java, building and extending test frameworks
* Experience testing high\\-performance frontend applications (WebGL/Three.js, WebAssembly, client\\-side databases)
* Strong backend API testing skills, including database validation and large\\-scale data pipeline testing
* Proficiency in CI/CD (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Buildkite) and infrastructure\\-as\\-code testing
* Knowledge of performance testing tools (k6, Locust, JMeter) and security best practices
* Passion for developer productivity, reducing MTTD/MTTR
* Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related technical field


 Pay is based on factors such as location, skill level, qualifications, competencies, and overall experience. Options may be included as an additional part of the package.
   

  

 Doxel also provides comprehensive health/dental/vision benefits for employees and their families, an Unlimited PTO policy, a 401(k) program, and a flexible work environment among other benefits.
   

  

 Doxel is an equal opportunity employer and actively seeks diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
   

  

 Join us in revolutionizing construction technology—where every line of code directly impacts real\\-world projects.
