 Production AI Infrastructure \\| ENGINPILOT Platform
 



 📍 Bangalore (Hybrid) \\| 3–5 Years \\| Full\\-Time
 



  





**About ENGINPILOT** 




 ENGINPILOT is an Engineering Intelligence Operating System governing decisions across the full asset lifecycle—from design to decommissioning. We build constitutional AI that respects immutable physical laws.
 



  





**Platform Ecosystem:** 



* ENGINPILOT.AI: Enterprise asset lifecycle management with digital twin synchronization
* ENGINgpt.AI: Physics\\-grounded conversational AI with multi\\-RAG architecture
* ENGINPILOT.ARMY: Global engineering community driving bottom\\-up adoption



  





**Core Differentiation:** 
 While traditional AI hallucinates, ENGINPILOT validates every output against thermodynamics, electrical theory, materials science, and mechanical principles—applying physics plausibility in safety\\-critical industrial environments.
 



  





**Constitutional Principles:** 



* Physics\\-First Intelligence – Physical laws as first\\-class requirements
* Absolute Human Authority – AI advises, humans decide
* Explainability by Design – Traceable reasoning chains
* Deterministic Validation – Rule\\-based safety gates override probabilistic outputs
* Immutable Audit Trails – Cryptographically signed decision provenance



  





**The Role** 




 Architect and scale our production multi\\-agent orchestration platform for safety\\-critical industrial environments processing billions in physical assets across textile mills, automotive factories, and pharmaceutical plants.
 



  





**What You'll Build:** 




**Multi\\-Agent Orchestration Platform** 



* Retriever Agents (multi\\-modal RAG: vector, metadata, knowledge graph, time\\-series)
* Parser Agents (datasheets, BOMs, CAD metadata, waveform analysis)
* Synthesizer Agents (LLM/SLM orchestration with constraint\\-aware generation)
* Validator Agents (deterministic rule engines, SPICE micro\\-simulations, thermal checks)
* Planner Agents (work orders, procurement APIs, maintenance scheduling)
* Memory Agents (hierarchical context with embedding compression)



**Agent Orchestrator Core** 




 Dynamic task routing based on query intent, data sensitivity, validation requirements, and policy constraints.
 



**Multi\\-RAG Evidence Fusion** 




 Parallel retrieval across exact metadata, semantic vectors, knowledge graphs, and time\\-series data—fused using content hashing and engineering\\-specific relevance reranking.
 



**Deterministic Safety Layer** 




 Rule\\-based validation applying electrical limits, mechanical tolerances, thermal derating, compliance verification—automatically overriding unsafe AI recommendations.
 



**Production Observability** 




 Comprehensive monitoring: retrieval precision/recall, validation pass rates, distributed traces with causal chains, immutable audit logs, cost\\-per\\-action analytics.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities** 




**System Architecture (40%)** 



* Design multi\\-agent systems with clean separation of reasoning, execution, validation, governance
* Build orchestration flows using DAG workflows, event\\-driven pipelines, async coordination
* Architect agent communication via gRPC (sync), Kafka/NATS (streaming), service mesh integration
* Develop policy\\-controlled agents with permission frameworks, safety gates, human\\-in\\-loop escalation



**LLM Integration \\& Validation (30%)** 



* Integrate LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) with deterministic systems (rule engines, physics models, digital twins)
* Implement cascade routing between cloud LLMs and on\\-premise SLMs based on sensitivity/latency/cost
* Build physics validation layers checking AI outputs against electrical rules, mechanical limits, compliance standards
* Develop simulation hooks for micro\\-validation (SPICE, thermal budgets, FEA stress verification)



**Platform Operations (20%)** 



* Ensure observability using Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Jaeger
* Optimize latency (P95 \\<3s), cost (GPU/API spend), reliability (retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks)
* Implement data governance: schema registries, lineage tracking, audit trails, RBAC
* Build CI/CD pipelines for agent deployment, A/B testing, blue\\-green rollouts



  





**Required Skills** 




**Core Engineering:** 



* Distributed Systems: Fault\\-tolerant architectures, consensus, replication, partitioning
* Programming: Expert Python; Go/Rust valued for performance\\-critical components
* Microservices: Event\\-driven systems, service boundaries, async patterns
* State Management: Idempotency, retry semantics, Saga pattern, exactly\\-once delivery



**Agentic AI \\& LLM Systems:** 



* Production LLM Experience: Shipped systems using OpenAI/Anthropic/equivalent
* Agent Frameworks: Tool execution, planning workflows, ReAct/CoT prompting, multi\\-agent collaboration
* Deterministic Integration: Combining probabilistic AI with rule engines, simulation checks, constraint solvers
* RAG Pipelines: Embeddings (OpenAI, Cohere), vector DBs (Weaviate, Pinecone, Qdrant), hybrid search



**Platform \\& Infrastructure:** 



* Cloud\\-Native: Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, AWS/Azure/GCP
* Communication: gRPC, REST, Kafka/NATS/RabbitMQ, WebSocket/SSE
* Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Jaeger
* Databases: TimescaleDB, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis



  





**Education:** 
 Bachelor's/Master's in CS/Engineering \\| 3–5 years backend/platform/AI systems experience
 



  





**What We Value** 



* Systems Thinking: Reason about failure cascades and emergent behaviors
* Truth \\& Verification: AI errors have real\\-world consequences—build explainable, validated systems
* Proactive Failure Analysis: Design graceful degradation before incidents occur
* Engineering Rigor in AI: Versioning, testing, monitoring, rollback strategies, canary deployments



  





**Nice\\-to\\-Have:** 



* Policy engines (OPA/Rego), physics simulations (SPICE, FEA, CFD)
* Industrial systems (SCADA, PLCs, OPC\\-UA), open\\-source contributions



  





**Why Join** 




**Technical Impact:** 
 Influence ₹200\\+ trillion in physical assets—factories, safety systems, equipment optimization
 



**Deep Challenges:** 
 Multi\\-agent coordination, physics\\-constrained reasoning, federated deployment, deterministic overrides, explainable decisions
 



**High Ownership:** 
 Employee \\#12–18 during hypergrowth. Your architecture shapes the platform for years.
 



**Physics\\-Informed AI Mission:** 
 Build AI grounded in reality—respecting thermodynamics, electrical theory, materials science
 



  





**Success Milestones:** 



* 30 Days: Ship multi\\-agent orchestrator MVP, deploy observability stack
* 90 Days: Scale to 1,000 queries/hour, P95 \\<3s, 95%\\+ validation accuracy
* 6 Months: Architect federated deployment, lead design reviews, mentor engineers
* 1 Year: Ship next\\-gen agent capabilities, establish domain expertise, represent ENGINPILOT publicly



  





**Growth:** 
 Senior Agentic Engineer (Year 2\\) → Staff/Tech Lead (Year 3\\) → Principal Engineer with increased equity and technical leadership.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/enginpilot","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEM6j4dxngJ4w/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1738740659966/build_ai_engine_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WHuDaKVQ7mkXhpe010rszv91w5YDXhDUasLLmmpiFnY","","","","","","","","","","",""
