 Integration \\& Automation
   

  

* Implement Power Automate workflows to support form submissions, approvals, and case


 intake processes.
   

  

* Work with architects to integrate with Azure services (Functions, Logic Apps, Service Bus, API

 Director, Product Management Job Description
   

  

 Reports to: VP, Experience \\& Growth
   

  

 Location: India
   

  

* This role requires strong time zone flexibility, with occasional availability during Pacific Time morning hours and collaboration with team members based both in Canada and India.


 Team: Product Management
   

  

 Portfolio: Experience \\& Growth
   

  

**About The Role**
 This role is focused on bringing our product vision into execution through thoughtful planning, strong cross\\-functional partnership, and a rigorous focus on product performance. Reporting to the VP, Experience \\& Growth, this role is tightly integrated with both Marketing and UX Design, which sit within the same portfolio.
   

  

 As Director of Product Management, you’ll be responsible for turning Charitable Impact’s founder\\-led product strategy into coordinated, high\\-performing execution pathways: building funnels, defi ning success metrics, and driving continuous experimentation to strengthen product outcomes. Working in close collaboration with UX Design, Engineering, Marketing and Customer Success, you will support delivery across product streams.
   

  

 At Charitable Impact, our approach to product management is intentionally diff erent. To us, product management is a discipline of orchestration, not ownership. One that focuses on systems, performance, and clarity so that all disciplines can lead from their strengths and deliver great software together. We see software building as a deeply collaborative process, one where Engineering, UX Design and Product Management contribute as equal partners.
   

  

 We’re looking for someone decisive but never domineering: a collaborative thinker who brings focus, clarity, and calm to complex problems, and fi nds strength in shared purpose. If you lead with both head and heart, thoughtful, grounded, and curious, and believe the best products are built in partnership, we’d love to connect
   

  

 What You’ll Do
   

  

 Strategic leadership
   

  

* Translate our founder\\-led product strategy into actionable, cross\\-platform plans.
* Support planning and prioritization cycles in close collaboration with key cross\\-functional partners and senior leadership.
* Ensure strategic priorities are refl ected in stream\\-level roadmaps, execution plans, and epics.
* Champion the product vision across teams, ensuring decisions remain aligned and focused.


 Analytics \\& product performance
   

  

* Champion a measurement and experimentation mindset across the team.
* Ensure product decisions are grounded in vision, supported by data, and are tracked with rigor.
* Partner with Engineering, Data \\& Insights, and UX Research to operationalize analytics and measure performance rigorously.
* Develop and own a unifi ed funnel between UX, Product and Marketing


 Team \\& process management
   

  

* Develop and scale product processes that support efficiency and accuracy across the team.
* Recruit, coach, and manage a high\\-performing, distributed team
* Establish clear accountabilities across product streams, fostering team health and individual growth.
* Continue to evolve our philosophy of product leadership—grounded in analysis, structure, service and operational excellence.
* Strengthen product development practices in our hybrid Agile environment, ensuring smooth collaboration across disciplines.


 Stream\\-based Execution
   

  

* Support a co\\-ownership model in close partnership with UX and Engineering.
* Provide execution oversight and support, ensuring projects are delivered on time, with quality, and aligned to strategy.
* Own the creation and maintenance of core product management deliverables: PRDs, roadmaps, go\\-to\\-market plans and so on.
* Ensure clarity around priorities, timelines, trade\\-off s, and scope across cross\\-functional teams.
* Defi ne success metrics, track performance, and establish a culture of continuous improvement and iteration.


 Advocacy \\& organizational Influence
   

  

* Advocate for supportive product management that amplifies Engineering, UX and Marketing.
* Represent the product function in leadership forums and company\\-wide planning eff orts.
* Contribute to strategic initiatives, particularly at the intersection of product, marketing, user experience, and technology.
* Own product communications for leadership, including trade\\-off summaries, status updates, executive updates, outcome reporting and so on.


 What Success Looks Like
   

  

* Product strategy is translated into focused, cross\\-functional workstreams that deliver measurable outcomes.
* Documentation, roadmaps, and execution plans are clear, current, and shared across all teams.
* UX, Product, and Marketing funnels operate in alignment, enabling a seamless donor experience.
* Core SaaS health metrics are tracked and understood—supporting better decisions and faster iteration.
* Experimentation and continuous learning are embedded into team culture and delivery practices.
* Leadership has visibility into progress, risks, and results through consistent reporting and actionable insights.
* The product function brings clarity, momentum, and strategic cohesion to the organization.


**Qualifications**
 At Charitable Impact, we believe in a thoughtful, empathetic and value\\-to\\-user approach to everything we do. We emphasize kindness and prioritize thoughtfulness over other qualities. As such, we are looking for a strategically\\-oriented self\\-starter who will stand behind our values and care about creating equitable and inclusive spaces for all.
   

  

**Specific To This Role, We Are Looking For**
* 10\\+ years of experience in product leadership roles, including directly managing and scaling high\\-performing product teams.
* Proven experience leading the development, shipping, and scaling of SaaS products with multi\\-user roles, complex data permissions, third\\-party integrations, and cross\\-platform functionality in multi\\-stakeholder environments.
* Demonstrated ability to leverage data as a strategic asset—embedding analytics into product planning, prioritization, and decision\\-making to drive business outcomes.
* Deep expertise in Agile, Lean, and hybrid development lifecycles, with a proven track record of supporting cross\\-functional collaboration across Engineering, UX, Marketing, and Customer Success to deliver high\\-impact outcomes.
* Exceptional communication and narrative\\-building skills, with the ability to distill complexity into clear, compelling insights for diverse stakeholders across technical and non\\-technical domains.
* A confident and steady leadership style that emphasizes clarity and service over control.
* Demonstrated AI literacy, with an informed perspective on emerging tools and their practical applications in product management, team productivity and operations.
* Familiarity with product development and workflow tools such as Jira, Confluence, and analytics platforms (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude, Quicksite and so on).
* Bonus:
* API experience.
