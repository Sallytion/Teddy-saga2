As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team.
   

 I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code.

 AgentAI Native – Developer (Enterprise) Role Summary Build high quality agentic AI applications—implement LLM tooling, RAG pipelines, vector search, and API integrations—delivering rapid prototypes that evolve into production systems. Own hands on development, testing, and integration, with a portfolio that demonstrates speed, experimentation, and learning. Responsibilities Hands on Build o Implement agents (tools, skills), prompts/templates, planners, memory, and evaluation loops write clean, testable code and CI/CD pipelines. o Stand up RAG services (ingestion, chunking, embeddings, indexing) and integrate vector DBs add observability and guardrails. Integration o Connect to enterprise APIs, event streams, and data sources ensure robust error handling, retries, and fallbacks. Quality \\& Safety o Write unit/integration tests implement offline/online evals, red team scenarios, and content/action safety boundaries. Iteration \\& Communication o Prototype quickly, demo frequently, and communicate trade offs and results clearly with stakeholders. Must Have Qualifications (AI Native archetype) Strong CS and software engineering fundamentals. Hands on experience with LLMs, RAG, vector DBs, and AI APIs. Proven ability to build end to end applications and integrate AI into systems. Visible portfolio of AI projects demonstrating experimentation and speed. Fast learner with a bias for rapid prototyping and iteration. Able to translate business problems into practical AI solutions with clear communication. Programming Languages (Developer) Core build proficiency (choose two or more): o Python (agent frameworks, data/RAG services, evaluation, notebooks to services) o TypeScript/Node.js (service wrappers, tool servers, API integration, front end hooks) o Java (enterprise services, Spring Boot, concurrency/performance) Nice to have: C\\#/.NET (enterprise stacks), Go (high throughput agents/services), Rust (performance critical tooling), SQL (PostgreSQL/pgvector, query optimization), Bash (DevOps).

* Implement code level and architectural fixes to improve system reliability
* Partner with Support and Product teams on high severity customer escalations
* Drive systemic improvements that reduce recurring incidents and operational toil
* Improve observability, logging, and debugging capabilities
* Contribute to zero downtime deployments and service resiliency improvements
* Participate in on\\-call rotation and respond to critical production incidents



  





**What You Bring** 



* 5 or more years of experience building and operating commercial software systems
* Strong proficiency in one or more object oriented languages such as C\\#, Java, or C\\+\\+
* Deep understanding of distributed systems, concurrency, and high availability architectures

* Excellent communication skills and the ability to explain complex technical issues clearly



  





**Preferred Qualifications** 



* Experience with Microsoft Exchange and MAPI
* Experience operating systems in AWS including EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, and related services
* Familiarity with messaging systems, search platforms, and large scale storage systems
* Experience participating in or leading incident response



  





**Why This Role Matters** 




 The Archive platform supports some of the largest organizations in the world. Reliability and performance are critical. This role ensures that our systems remain resilient, scalable, and stable while we continue to evolve the architecture and migrate customers to Archive 6\\.0\\.
 



 If you enjoy solving hard technical problems, diving into complex systems, and improving production reliability at scale, this role will challenge and reward you.","Computer and Network Security and Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/proofpoint","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFEzwJn3C-nDQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1726764831463/proofpoint_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=UytbviYQ7LPi0Ht8P29i0ulfIZZKQRheA5k31LAUhVs","","","","","","","","","","",""

* Harden \\& simplify deployments. Advance our CD/GitOps workflows (progressive delivery, automated rollbacks, canaries), with golden paths and strong guardrails.
* Build the internal developer portal. Curate paved roads for services, data, and infra via templates, scorecards, and software catalogs to improve discoverability and self\\-service.
* Introduce AI\\-assisted engineering.
+ Ship secure, private AI copilots for code authoring, refactoring, and code review.
+ Use LLMs for test generation, flaky test triage, log summarization, debug suggestions, Error classifications, Selective Test Execution and AIOps across CI/CD.
+ Build evaluation harnesses, prompt libraries, RAG over internal docs, and policy controls for IP, PII, and secrets.
