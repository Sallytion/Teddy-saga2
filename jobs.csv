**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

**Work Environment \\& Team Structure**
* You’ll be reporting directly to the founders (CEO \\& CTO).
* Day\\-to\\-day work will be primarily with the CTO (co\\-founder).
* Remote role, but must have a few hours of overlap with the U.S. morning time zone.

**Why Join Us?**
* Be part of a scaling SaaS product used daily by bakeries and restaurants.
