You build AI\\-powered systems that leave traditional engineering methods in the dust. If this describes you, read on.
   

  

 The majority of software teams continue to code using outdated methods—manual debugging workflows, inconsistent deployment practices, and features that barely scratch the surface of AI beyond occasional Copiloh hints. Trilogy operates differently. AI is embedded throughout our entire development pipeline: from generating feature concepts to detecting bugs, resolving defects, and optimizing performance. This isn't about experimenting with AI utilities on the side; it's about embedding AI deeply into every phase of the software development lifecycle to remove inefficiency, accelerate shipping, and engineer with accuracy.
   

  

 In this position, you will deconstruct existing B2B products, re\\-engineer them as cloud\\-native solutions, and enhance them using AI at every layer. You'll develop and release AI\\-enhanced features, apply advanced retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG) techniques for automated defect identification, and guarantee seamless releases—no downtime, no service interruptions, no compromises. If you're seeking a role where you spend weeks discussing architecture instead of delivering software, look elsewhere.
   

  

 If you're prepared to redefine what AI\\-driven software engineering means and advance your career rapidly, apply now. If you prefer maintaining your comfort zone, manually writing test cases, or staying in teams that resist automation, this role is not for you.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Utilizing analysis tools and RAG vector stores to locate, diagnose, and resolve product defects and address bugs.
* Harnessing AI development agents to architect, build, and ship innovative features for cloud\\-native applications.
* Guiding AI agents and serving as the quality checkpoint for AI\\-generated outputs; AI results are not perfect and demand your engineering judgment.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Repetitive Busywork: We minimize tedious infrastructure overhead so you can concentrate on building innovative solutions.
* Meeting Overload: We prioritize your development skills over conference room time. Expect more coding, less discussion.


**Software Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Deploy AI\\-powered features to optimize workflows and equip service providers with cutting\\-edge tools.


**Basic Requirements**
* At least 4 years of professional experience in commercial software development, focusing on production code for server\\-side web applications
* At least 1 year of experience with serverless architectures and cloud\\-native development (any cloud vendor)
* Experience using GenAI code assistants (e.g., Github Copilot, Cursor, v0\\.dev); we are not looking for traditional ML engineers without LLM experience
* Experience writing production\\-level code in at least two general\\-purpose coding languages, such as Typescript, Javascript, Python, or C\\#
* Experience developing APIs
* Experience using SQL databases


**About Trilogy**
 Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer\\-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon\\-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud\\-based stack.
