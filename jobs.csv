 Looking for immediate joiners.
 



  





 This requirement is for a US based product company, who are in the process of establishing their Offshore Development Centre in Hyderabad, India. You will be part of the initial team and will be playing a crucial role in building a world class enterprise product.
 



  





 If you are passionate, self\\-motivated, go\\-getter and want to explore new horizons, then you are the one we are looking for. Please apply.
 



  





**About the Role** 




 We are building a Low Code / No Code (LCNC) Connector Builder that enables non\\-developers to create production\\-grade connectors for integrating enterprise systems with the RadiantOne Identity Data Platform.
 



 Today, connectors are built as Java Maven projects using our Connector SDK and require months of skilled development. This initiative transforms that experience—allowing partners and customers to build connectors through configuration\\-driven authoring in weeks or even days.
 



 As a Backend Engineer on this team, you will help design and implement the core engine that converts YAML\\-based connector definitions into clean, testable Java code, powering the next generation of identity integrations.
 



  





**What You’ll Work On** 



* Extend and enhance a Java\\-based Connector SDK
* Design and implement configuration\\-driven connector authoring
* Build tooling that converts YAML configurations into Java source code
* Implement REST API integrations (CRUD operations, authentication, error handling)
* Solve complex mapping between REST APIs and LDAP directory models
* Ensure generated code is clean, correct, testable, and production\\-ready
* Collaborate on documentation and examples for integrators and customers



  





**Required Skills \\& Experience** 



* 4\\-6 years of strong experience with Core Java
* Hands\\-on experience working with REST APIs
* Endpoint design
* Request/response mapping
* Error handling
* Experience working with structured configuration data
* YAML
* JSON
* Ability to read, understand, and implement Java interfaces
* Experience debugging and testing system integrations



  





**Highly Desired** 



* Knowledge of LDAP / directory services
* DN structures
* Object classes
* CRUD operations
* Experience with identity platforms
* Directory integrations
* Synchronization concepts



  





**Nice to Have** 



* Experience with code generation frameworks
* FreeMarker
* Apache Velocity
* Burningwave
* Familiarity with schema mapping or ETL tools
* Understanding of OpenAPI specifications



  





**Key Technical Challenges You’ll Tackle** 



* Mapping flexible REST API responses to fixed LDAP schemas
* Supporting multiple authentication patterns:
* API keys
* OAuth
* Basic Authentication
* Generating maintainable, testable Java code from declarative configuration
* Balancing flexibility for users with strict correctness guarantees



  





**Why Join Us** 



* Work on a platform\\-level problem with real enterprise impact
* Shape how non\\-developers build production integrations
* Operate at the intersection of identity, APIs, and developer tooling
* Help us stay ahead of competitors in the identity integration space","Software Development","https://in.linkedin.com/company/xeniocode-technologies","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHoQTtIc1OUNg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1710413227477/xeniocode_technologies_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=4LGGM9StPTCYjD0i5NAfwf7gH35hcJJWdZwq0qAYyE0","","","","","","","","","","",""

 About the Role: We are looking for an experienced Software Developer who is passionate about code quality, readability, and education.

* Prompt Engineering: Create high\\-quality ""User Prompts"" (natural language instructions) and corresponding ""Gold Standard"" code solutions to train the model.
* Reinforcement Learning (RLHF): Review code generated by AI models. Rank different outputs based on accuracy, efficiency, and style, and explicitly correct errors.
* Quality Assurance: ensure all code in the training set adheres to strict style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) and is free of security vulnerabilities.
* Error Analysis: Identify
 
*why* 

 a model failed to generate the correct code (e.g., logic error vs. syntax error) and provide feedback to improve future performance.



  






 Who We Are Looking For:
 



* Strong Coding Proficiency: Expert\\-level knowledge in \\[Insert Languages: e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, C\\+\\+]. You must be able to write ""perfect"" code that serves as a ground\\-truth example.
