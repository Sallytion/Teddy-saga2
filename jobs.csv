 SecureOS is a stealth startup building an
 **agentic, AI\\-native GRC platform** 
 that automates security, compliance, risk, and vendor risk workflows end\\-to\\-end. We’re not building another compliance dashboard. We’re replacing manual work with systems and AI agents.
 



  





**Role** 




 This is
 **not** 
 a checkbox compliance role.
 



 You will:
 


* Own
 **real customer outcomes** 
 (SOC 2, HIPAA, HITRUST readiness)
* Work directly with
 **founders, engineers, and auditors**
* Turn messy, manual compliance work into
 **repeatable systems**
* Help design and validate
 **AI agents that replace human effort over time**



 If you’re looking for stability, rigid processes, or a 9–5 compliance job,

 **agent workflows**
* Help define how SecureOS agents
 **reason, act, and validate controls**
* Replace manual work with scripts, tooling, or AI over time



**What Success Looks Like** 




**30 Days** 



* Own customer engagements
* Produce a clear, written delivery playbook
* Identify top repetitive compliance tasks



**60 Days** 



* Replace tasks with automation or agent workflows
* Reduce founder involvement in delivery
* Improve delivery speed and customer experience



**90 Days** 



* Delivery no longer depends on founders
* Agent workflows are demo\\-ready
* Consulting work directly feeds the product roadmap



  





**Required Experience** 



* Hands\\-on ownership of
 **SOC 2, HIPAA, HITRUST, and ISO's readiness** 
 (end\\-to\\-end)
* Experience working with startups or fast\\-moving teams
* Strong written communication and documentation skills
* Comfort operating in ambiguity with high ownership
* Curiosity about
 **AI, automation, and agent\\-based systems**
* Understanding of
 **TPRM / vendor risk, FAIR** 
 concepts



  





**Strongly Preferred** 



* Familiarity with
* Experience working alongside
 **DevOps or platform engineering teams**



  





**What We're not looking for** 



* Advisor\\-only or oversight\\-only profiles
* People who avoid execution or hands\\-on delivery

* Traditional GRC roles focused purely on documentation.



  





**Why Join SecureOS?** 



* Work directly with founders.

* AI Leadership: Accelerate adoption of new AI workflows and develop high\\-impact playbooks.

* Quality Reviews: Verify your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality standards.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Functioning as an architect without coding
* Spending time in endless meetings
* Managing people (this is a technical leadership position, not a people management role)
* Maintaining legacy systems or internal IT infrastructure


**Basic Requirements**
**Technical Lead key responsibilities**
* At least 5 years of professional software development experience building software products
* At least 3 years as either a lead engineer (reviewing others' work) or architect (making key technical decisions)
* Experience working on platform\\-level products where other teams consumed your APIs
* Deep engagement with AI tools, actively experimenting and pushing boundaries
