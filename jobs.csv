 The Team: From the merchandise stores at Sports venues to small\\-format stores such as Amazon Go, a new kind of technology is powering stores with no lines and no checkout. You simply use the Amazon app to enter the store, take what you want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals, grocery essentials and merchandise, and go.
   

  

 Our checkout\\-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out (JWO) Technology.

 The Role: You are a talented Software Engineer who knows how to design and code full\\-stack solutions. You know how to get things done, and done really well. You are a dreamer and a futurist.

 The Team: From the merchandise stores at Sports venues to small\\-format stores such as Amazon Go, a new kind of technology is powering stores with no lines and no checkout. You simply use the Amazon app to enter the store, take what you want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals, grocery essentials and merchandise, and go.
   

  

 Our checkout\\-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out (JWO) Technology. It automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a cart. When you’re done shopping, you just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. Designed and custom\\-built by Amazonians, our technology uses computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning. Innovation is part of our DNA. We need people who want to join a high\\-reaching program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.

 You will tackle challenging situations every day and you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems. Along the way, we guarantee that you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on many customers.
   

  

 The Role: You are a talented Software Engineer who knows how to design and code full\\-stack solutions. You know how to get things done, and done really well. You are a dreamer and a futurist. You have an inventor’s spirit, a can\\-do approach and proficiency in a wide range of design technologies, and a killer eye for detail. We are looking for talented engineers for Java and AWS services.
   

  

 In this role you’ll have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game\\-changing initiative. While you’ll be able to use existing Amazon systems when possible, you’ll be working on challenging problems that need creative solutions. You should be comfortable building prototypes, challenging assumptions, and thinking of creative ways to tackle challenges.

 At DevRev, we’re building the future of work with
 **Computer** 
 – your AI teammate.
   

  

 Computer is not just another tool. It’s built on the belief that the future of work should be about genuine human connection and collaboration – not piling on more apps.
   

  

 Computer is the best kind of teammate: it amplifies your strengths, takes repetition and frustration out of your day, and gives you more time and energy to do your best work.
   

  

 How?
   

  

 Easy: it’s the only platform capable of…
   

  

**Complete data unification**
 Most AI products focus on either structured data (like CRM records and support tickets), or unstructured data (like documents and emails). Computer AirSync connects everything, unifying all your data sources (like Google Workspace, Jira, Notion) into one AI\\-ready source of truth: Computer Memory.
   

  

**Powerful search, reasoning, and action**
 Once connected to all your tools and apps, Computer is embedded in your full business context. It can find and summarize, sure. Even more impressive: it offers employees insights, strategic and proactive suggestions, plus powerful agentic actions.
   

  

**Extensions for your teams and customers**
 Computer doesn’t make you choose between new software and old. Its AI\\-native platform lets you extend existing tools with sophisticated apps and agents. So your teams – and your customers – can take action, seamlessly. These agents work alongside you: updating workflows, coordinating across teams, and syncing back to your systems.
   

  

 This isn’t just software. Computer brings
 *people* 
 back together, breaking down silos and ushering in the future of teamwork, through human\\-AI collaboration. Stop managing software. Stop wasting time. Start solving bigger problems, building better products, and making your customers happier.

* Experience in system design — being able to design systems at scale (connector frameworks, integration layers, retry \\& failure models, etc.).
* Experience working with external APIs, webhooks, authentication/authorization (e.g. OAuth, API keys), error\\-handling.
* Knowledge of asynchronous programming and concurrency in JS/TS.
* Good debugging and performance\\-profiling skills.


**Nice\\-to\\-Have**

 At DevRev, we’re building the future of work with
 **Computer** 
 – your AI teammate.
   

  

 Computer is not just another tool. It’s built on the belief that the future of work should be about genuine human connection and collaboration – not piling on more apps.
   

  

 Computer is the best kind of teammate: it amplifies your strengths, takes repetition and frustration out of your day, and gives you more time and energy to do your best work.
   

  

 How?
   

  

 Easy: it’s the only platform capable of…
   

  

**Complete data unification**
 Most AI products focus on either structured data (like CRM records and support tickets), or unstructured data (like documents and emails). Computer AirSync connects everything, unifying all your data sources (like Google Workspace, Jira, Notion) into one AI\\-ready source of truth: Computer Memory.
   

  

**Powerful search, reasoning, and action**
 Once connected to all your tools and apps, Computer is embedded in your full business context. It can find and summarize, sure. Even more impressive: it offers employees insights, strategic and proactive suggestions, plus powerful agentic actions.
   

  

**Extensions for your teams and customers**
 Computer doesn’t make you choose between new software and old. Its AI\\-native platform lets you extend existing tools with sophisticated apps and agents. So your teams – and your customers – can take action, seamlessly. These agents work alongside you: updating workflows, coordinating across teams, and syncing back to your systems.
   

  

 This isn’t just software. Computer brings
 *people* 
 back together, breaking down silos and ushering in the future of teamwork, through human\\-AI collaboration. Stop managing software. Stop wasting time. Start solving bigger problems, building better products, and making your customers happier.
   

  

 We call this Team Intelligence. It’s why DevRev exists.
   

  

 Trusted by global companies across multiple industries, DevRev is backed by Khosla Ventures and Mayfield, with $150M\\+ raised. We are 650\\+ people, across eight global offices.

 As a Forward Deployed Engineer at DevRev, you will work closely with our pre\\- and post\\-sales Customer Experience team by developing solutions over the core platform via applications written in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, etc. One of the key functions of this role is, building the Knowledge Graph that includes integration of DevRev with other SaaS and non\\-SaaS systems through webhooks and APIs and/ or real\\-time communication architectures.
