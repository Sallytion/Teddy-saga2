 RequirementsAbsolute Requirements (Non\\-Negotiable)
 
 You will not be considered without demonstrated experience in ALL of the following:
 


* **Production Go development (3\\+ years)** 
  \\- You must have built and maintained production Go services. We will ask about goroutines, channels, context, sync primitives, and memory management. If Go is not one of your primary languages, do not apply.
* **WebRTC protocol expertise** 
  \\- You must understand ICE candidate gathering, STUN/TURN servers, SDP offer/answer, DTLS/SRTP, and RTP/RTCP. We will ask you to explain the WebRTC connection flow in detail.
* **Video streaming experience** 
  \\- You must have worked with RTSP, RTP, or similar streaming protocols. Experience with H.264 codec handling, keyframes, and media pipelines required.
* **Network debugging skills**
