Ultimately, we seek to enable lawyers to achieve more efficient, data\\-oriented, and fact\\-based legal outcomes. We started our journey as a company by focusing on the crucial 'discovery' phase of the legal process. One of our offerings, Ediscovery, focuses on enabling legal teams to achieve these outcomes with incredible efficiency.
   

  

 The massive data proliferation over the last decades has revealed the limitations of many legal technology products, impacting the efficiency of legal practices. At CS DISCO, we strive to provide solutions to the legal domain that are magical. To do so requires the processing of large volumes of data at petabyte scale, with high availability, while maximizing performance, minimizing operations cost, and also ensuring data security, privacy, and sovereignty.
   

  

 Our overarching mission is to create a unified technology platform for the practice of law. We envision a suite of products focused on delivering distinctly better legal outcomes with a minimum of human toil and cost. Our technology addresses the challenges of scale in data and enables legal teams to focus on the critical tasks that necessitate human legal judgment.
   

  

 With a trajectory that has already seen substantial disruption in this market, our approach is underscored by a lawyer\\-inspired interface and a cloud\\-enabled technology platform, aiming for exemplary performance and cost efficiency. Thoughtful product planning and design are ingrained in our “product first” business ethos and culture, aligning with the broader objective of enhancing the practice of law through technology.
