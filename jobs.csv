 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

"li-4324508996","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4324508996","","AI Software Engineer, Trilogy (Remote) - $100,000/year USD","Crossover","","","fulltime","","","","","",True,"mid-senior level","Engineering, Information Technology, and Product Management","","","The software industry remains trapped in outdated delivery rhythms. Backlogs expand unchecked, cycle times stretch across weeks, and code review often devolves into perfunctory approval to meet sprint deadlines. Integration risk, fragile architectures, and ambiguous requirements continue to overwhelm most engineering teams. AI coding agents now produce viable code, yet only when provided with exact specifications and closely monitored execution. The default response is still to add more developers rather than redesign the systems that transform requirements into dependable, production\\-ready software.
   

  

 Trilogy has chosen a different approach. We operate an agentic development pipeline from start to finish: engineers own research, specification, architecture, and validation, while AI agents execute implementation. Specifications are crafted to be machine\\-executable by Claude Code, test\\-driven, and narrowly scoped to contain integration risk. The outcome is continuous shipment of production features with significantly compressed feedback cycles, reduced integration surprises, and elevated confidence in correctness before code reaches the main branch.
   

  

 This role is designed for the engineer who prefers designing systems and validating correctness over processing tickets. Your time will divide roughly as follows: 10–20% conducting research and technical discovery to map existing behavior, constraints, and stakeholder objectives; 40–50% translating that knowledge into precise, test\\-driven, agent\\-executable specifications and architectural choices; and 40–50% orchestrating and supervising implementation. You own what ships: no silent breakage, no vague specifications, no deflecting accountability to the agent.
   

  

 You'll work alongside a team that regards specification as product output, review as an engineering function, and delivery as the sole meaningful metric. If you're motivated by clean system design, precise scoping, and uncompromising validation—and you already integrate tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or ChatGPT into your everyday workflow—this environment will suit you. Bring your architectural judgment, your test\\-driven development discipline, and your exacting standards for code quality. If this describes you, join us and define the next generation of software delivery. Apply and demonstrate how you direct agents to produce production\\-grade results at scale.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Discovery: Examining existing systems, stakeholder needs, and data sources to map the problem domain and identify technical constraints
* Technical Specification: Translating research outcomes and stakeholder inputs into precise, machine\\-executable technical specifications tailored for agentic coding assistants (primarily Claude Code) following spec\\-driven development practices
* AI Implementation: Directing AI coding agents through implementation, performing continuous review and validation of agent\\-generated code, and merging validated changes into the production codebase


**AI Software Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Continuous shipment of production\\-quality software features and systems through agentic development workflows, in which AI coding agents execute implementation while engineers control specification, architecture, and quality assurance


**Basic Requirements**
* Minimum 3 years professional software engineering experience in production environments
* Experience participating in pull request review processes
* Experience using AI coding tools (e.g. Claude Code, Windsurf, Cursor) in a professional setting
