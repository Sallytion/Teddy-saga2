**About The Team**
 On the Voice Service and Experience Team we:
   

  

 ▪ Own features end\\-to\\-end, from the customer need all the way to the back\\-end implementation
   

  

 ▪ Ship code to production every day
   

  

 ▪ Are highly collaborative and foster a learning environment
   

  

 ▪ Do Agile development, with Sprints and regular retrospectives
   

  

 ▪ Function in a highly progressive, quick\\-iteration environment focused on delivering consistent, incremental customer value
   

  

 ▪ Have something new to demo every week
   

  

 The team’s mission is to continually reduce the time spent by customer\\-facing representatives on data access and modification across different systems. We provide customers with meaningful and relevant data aggregated at their fingertips, to increase the time they can invest in adding value for their customers.
   

  

 We’re currently shoring up the core functionalities of our telecom product. In the long term we want to give customers the same edge with calling and messaging that they have with email: the ability to optimize and constantly improve how they interact with customers. We will face new challenges as we continue to scale out to ten times the volume of calling we have today and beyond. These efforts present a diverse gamut of work that will help enhance Outreach’s competitive edge by making our customers more effective.
   

  

**The Role**
 Making and receiving voice calls are a key component of the Outreach product offering. Every month, Outreach customers complete more than 8 million calls with their prospects on our voice platform. The Voice Service and Experience Team is hiring software engineers to increase its momentum in this space. If you have experience building high availability voice communication experiences on top of open\\-source real\\-time communication software and commercial communications platform APIs, we’d love to talk to you about this opportunity.
   

  

 Telecom system development is a little different from other web development. The features we build are inherently heavy on state, complex in workflow, and include extensive third\\-party integrations. You’ll have to be creative, build on top of a lot of existing technology, and stay focused on Outreach’s core value proposition of revenue efficiency. You’ll be building systems to ensure calling is simple, reliable, and crystal clear; so that our customers can reduce the time on clicking around or performing repetitive actions and focus on what matters most \\- interacting with their prospects.
   

  

**Your Daily Adventures Will Include**
* Partnering with product managers, designers, and analysts to deeply understand the needs of our users and build a product that serves those needs
* Working with commercial CPaaS APIs and open\\-source real\\-time communication software to manage calls, messages, and security
* Finding ways to engineer high availability into a system that has lots of moving parts
* Working with stakeholders to make sure our customers have the tools they need to be successful on our platform
* Setting direction for the team and help guide engineering vision

* Experience with VoIP, specifically using WebRTC and SIP to facilitate real\\-time communication between users and with phone numbers across the globe (plus)


**Why You’ll Love It Here**
* Highly competitive salary
* 25 days annual vacation time \\+ sick time and casual leave
* Group medical policy coverage available to employees and up to 5 eligible family members
* OPD benefit covered up to INR 10,000
* Life insurance and personal accident insurance at 3x annual CTC
* 26 weeks of maternity leave pay, and 15 days of paternity leave pay
* Opportunity to be part of company success via the RSU program
* Diversity and inclusion programs that promote employee resource groups like OWN\\+ (Outreach Women's Network), Adelante (Latinx community), OBX (Outreach Black Connection), Mosaic (AAPI community), Pride (LGBTQIA\\+), Gender\\+, Disability Community, and Veterans/Military
