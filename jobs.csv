The software gateway services will intercept web traffic, operator actions, and CI/CD pipelines to perform a set of assurance functions such as vulnerability scanning, signature validation, rules checking, policy compliance and anomaly detection. These functions will generate logs, audit trails, metrics, and alerts to enable automated and manual assurance of code as well as ingress/egress traffic. The team will develop and maintain the gateway code as well as operate the gateway infrastructure for the application. The team will be responsible for the performance, scalability, and reliability of the gateways. In particular, they will be responsible for ensuring that the performance of the application, as well as the developer velocity of the application teams, are not negatively impacted by the assurance gateways. They will optimize the gateway code to ensure low overhead and they will scale the gateways to handle increases in traffic and in the frequencies of application updates.

 We’re seeking a highly skilled, hands\\-on Product Engineer with strong end\\-to\\-end product development experience \\- from concept (0→1\\) through iterative launch and scaling. You’ll own features across the stack (frontend, backend, infra), with a strong sense of UX, design quality, and user empathy.
 



 The ideal candidate has shipped real products publicly on Product Hunt, App Store, or live web platforms and can demonstrate thoughtful product decisions, iteration, and measurable user impact. You’ll work in a lean, high\\-velocity pod alongside ML and DevOps specialists, contributing not just code but direction, polish, and execution. This is a role for builders who thrive on accountability, autonomy, and the craft of taking products live.
 



  





**Responsibilities:** 



* Full\\-Stack Product Ownership: Design, build, and ship features end\\-to\\-end \\- from concept to deployment \\- ensuring smooth, performant, and polished user experiences.
* Frontend \\& UX Craft: Implement high\\-quality, responsive, and performant interfaces. Own details like animations, progress indicators, and state management for media\\-heavy workflows.
* Backend \\& Infrastructure: Build robust APIs, real\\-time features, and integrations with ML pipelines. Ensure reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
* Media \\& Streaming Systems: Develop performant video workflows, upload/processing flows, streaming, and playback experiences with real\\-time progress tracking.
* AI/ML Integration: Collaborate with MLOps engineers to integrate and productionize ML features, handling data flows, inference endpoints, and user\\-facing AI interactions.
* DevOps \\& CI/CD: Manage efficient deployments using modern cloud tooling (preferably GCP) and maintain CI/CD pipelines for rapid iteration.
* Product Thinking \\& Iteration: Drive decisions grounded in user feedback and metrics. Balance trade\\-offs between polish, speed, and scalability.
* Collaboration \\& Initiative: Work closely with designers and specialists, proactively proposing improvements and solutions rather than just surfacing blockers.



  





**Requirements:** 



* Experience: Proven record of shipping live products (preferably 4\\+ years in product\\-focused engineering).
* Portfolio Evidence: Links to real products, public launches, or active projects (Product Hunt, GitHub, App Store, live demos).
* Full\\-Stack Skills: Proficient in modern frontend frameworks (Next.js, Firebase Storage SDK, React Query) and backend environments (NestJS, TypeORM, PostgreSQL).
* Media/Video Expertise: Experience with streaming, video processing, encoding, or real\\-time rendering systems.
* Cloud \\& CI/CD: Familiar with GCP, containerized deployments (Docker/Kubernetes), and automated pipelines.
* AI/ML Exposure: Comfortable integrating ML models or AI APIs into production features.
* Execution Mindset: Bias toward action, accountability, and high ownership of outcomes.
* Product Sense: Demonstrated ability to think from a user’s perspective \\- balancing technical feasibility with product value.



  





**What you get:** 



* Best in class salary: We hire only the best, and we pay accordingly.
* Proximity Talks: Meet other designers, engineers, and product geeks — and learn from experts in the field.
* Keep on learning with a world\\-class team: Work with the best in the field, challenge yourself constantly, and learn something new every day.
