 Mehul and Shyam are second\\-time founders. After selling their previous Fintech Startup to the largest E\\-commerce platform in India, they are diving headlong into AI with the hopes to transform how offline commerce works across the globe.
 



  





 We are building The Search Engine for Offline. Want to find dentists in your area for an appointment in the afternoon? We will find one. Want to see if there are restaurants that serve vegan and Japanese cuisine? We will hunt for one. Too busy to cook? Need to ensure the cafe down your street has a sandwich and coffee ready for you to take? We will make the call.
 



  





 We are building Gen\\-AI based agentic systems that can search \\& filter options available anywhere in the world on behalf of consumers. We observe that even though 90% of all commerce is done offline, there is a huge gap of information in the offline commerce vs online. There is a huge cost of time and effort for the consumers currently to bridge the gap. We think GenAI can collect this data at scale in no\\-time on behalf of the consumers.
 



  





 We are building these “GenAI wrappers” and orchestrating them to offer consumers a means to instantly find what they want AND suppliers the visibility they never got otherwise.
 



  





 Our mission is ambitious, and our product is at the cutting edge of AI. To achieve this, we need a team that is not just skilled, but deeply invested in the mission. We believe everyone gets one or two opportunities in their life to build their life’s work. We think this is ours and want to work with people who are willing to grab it and make it theirs too!
 



  





**What are we looking for?** 




  





 Through this position, we are looking to find a founding engineer who will plant the seed and oversee the app development and publishing journey of the company. As a B2C company with a global target audience and an “impossible” ambitious growth plan, this is one of the most crucial, challenging and exciting positions to be in!
 



  





 In a frontend founding engineer we are looking for someone who:
 


* is well versed in React Native
* has previously deployed apps in iOS and Android app stores
* is FAST at building without compromising quality
* loves delivering pixel perfect and smooth experience to end users
* has the ability to perform under ambiguity



  





 While the
 
 above requirements are a must\\-have
 
 for this role, we think the following qualities are good to have:
 



  




* Have been a founder or a founding engineer before
* Are exposed to GenAI\\-based applications or projects
* Are up to date (and have adopted) the latest tech \\- frameworks, open source projects, AI Tools, etc.



  





**What will you get to do?** 




  





 As a startup in its inception stage with a small team, the roles are often flexible with an opportunity to explore and contribute in different aspects of the company. As a founding frontend engineer, we expect you to take in the following responsibilities but are free to contribute to anything else as per your interest:
 


* Lead mobile app development lifecycle
* We want you to set up the entire lifecycle of mobile app development: code structure, ci/cd pipelines and publishing.
* Help grow and mentor the tech team
* As a founding engineer, we expect you also to mentor relatively junior team members as and when possible.



  









**Location and Culture** 




  





 We primarily work out of
 
 HSR Layout, Bangalore.
 
 We strive to maintain a flat hierarchy within the team and a “no corporate BS” dynamic. We work hard, we party hard. We have a
 
 fully work from office
 
 DNA \\- we prefer people talking to each other and resolving issues in real\\-time instead of a backlog of emails or texts to get back to when available. While we embrace the hustle culture required for our mission, we like to chill and relax on the weekends, we often plan random team outings and events.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/auroraxai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFGtZ8LZanJDw/company-logo_100_100/B56ZyYxNykKYAQ-/0/1772089564776?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=SlEhClLwdt4FK8Qnh_IyKejsXcshb_jvs-ko0ohj4y4","","","","","","","","","","",""
