 Operational excellence at Trilogy is not optional—it is a core competitive advantage. We acquire software companies rapidly and scale them with even greater speed. To sustain this pace, we require executives capable of designing and deploying lean, automated systems rather than addressing complexity through expanded headcount.
   

  

 You will take ownership of comprehensive transformations throughout our global portfolio. This may involve redesigning the offboarding process for over 1,200 employees following acquisitions, replacing platforms like Jira and Salesforce with AI agents, or creating automations that save thousands of manual hours. Execution will be rapid, leveraging Python, LLM APIs, and tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, and MCP—supported by a library of proven playbooks that enable you to concentrate on results.
   

  

 Trilogy manages a portfolio of more than 100 products with disciplined efficiency. We function with reduced hierarchy, accelerated cycles, and elevated standards compared to conventional enterprise settings. This represents an opportunity to generate large\\-scale impact without navigating bureaucracy or overseeing inflated teams.
   

  

 We do not engage in steady\\-state operations. We do not delegate transformation externally. And we do not recruit individuals who require approval or extensive support structures to perform. We are seeking a select group of technically proficient, execution\\-oriented leaders who treat automation as leverage and velocity as strategic doctrine. If this describes you—you will excel here.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Leading high\\-complexity operational initiatives including M\\&A integrations, enterprise system migrations, and large\\-scale organizational transitions
* Building and deploying automations to replace CRM and task management platforms using Python and LLM APIs
* Implementing AI\\-powered workflows through Cursor, Windsurf, and MCP to remove manual effort and reduce execution latency
* Driving projects from diagnosis through deployment, applying proven playbooks and executive\\-level decision\\-making
* Completing a practical technical challenge that validates your capacity to design and deliver AI\\-first solutions


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Overseeing large teams or depending on organizational layers to accomplish objectives
* Attending prolonged alignment sessions or waiting for consensus to progress
* Handing off complex work to IT departments or third\\-party vendors—you will design and implement solutions directly
* Managing steady\\-state operations—this role centers on transformation and rapid execution


**AI Operations Specialist Key Responsibilities**
 Architect and implement AI\\-first operational systems that remove manual processes, reduce complexity, and enable scalable execution throughout Trilogy's global software portfolio.
   

  

**Basic Requirements**
* Located in North America (excluding California), South/Central America, or Western Europe (UTC \\-8 to UTC \\+2\\)
* 5\\+ years of operational leadership within enterprise software environments
* 3\\+ years in customer\\-facing functions (Support, Sales, Collections, etc.)
* Proven capability to develop automation using Python and integrate with LLM APIs
* Hands\\-on experience with Cursor, Windsurf, MCP, or comparable tools to deliver production\\-grade automations
* Demonstrated ability to operate quickly, think autonomously, and deliver critical results without close supervision


**Nice\\-to\\-have Requirements**
* Track record leading large\\-scale organizational changes such as M\\&A integrations or mass offboarding initiatives
* Background in designing and implementing AI\\-driven operational systems
* Collection of automations you have personally developed and deployed at scale


**About Trilogy**

Even with rudimentary automation in place, conventional QA approaches consistently miss critical bugs until after deployment, resulting in expensive setbacks and dissatisfied end users. Industry data indicates that more than 60% of software defects surface after release, with quality failures imposing a staggering $2 trillion annual cost on the global software sector. Delivering faster, dependable software requires a fundamental transformation in quality assurance strategy.
   

  

 IgniteTech is driving this transformation by embedding GenAI capabilities throughout the entire QA lifecycle. We leverage artificial intelligence to model user interactions, create sophisticated test scenarios, and evaluate defect patterns, enabling accelerated delivery with reduced bug counts. Joining our team positions you at the cutting edge of this shift, where AI eliminates bottlenecks and enables proactive problem detection.
   

  

 This position differs significantly from conventional QA roles. If you seek an environment centered on manual test execution or routine automation scripting, you will not find it here. In this role, you will take ownership of designing and advancing AI\\-powered test automation architectures, apply predictive analytics to surface latent risks, and influence the trajectory of software quality standards. You will engineer adaptive, scalable systems suited to the demands of contemporary development—not function within a static, legacy framework. If this aligns with the challenge you have been seeking, submit your application and contribute to the evolution of software development.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Design, deploy, and sustain AI\\-powered test automation frameworks that produce test cases, scripts, and datasets for thorough product validation
* Apply GenAI technologies to evaluate test results, detect defect trends, and deliver actionable recommendations for ongoing quality enhancement
* Model user interactions, load scenarios, and boundary conditions to detect issues before end\\-user exposure


**Senior Quality Assurance Automation Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Employ AI and automation technologies to accelerate product delivery cycles and reduce defect rates


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your default approach is to write code manually before leveraging AI tools for validation or improvement, rather than beginning with AI, this role is not suitable for you)
* A minimum of 2 years of professional experience in QA automation
* Demonstrated expertise with Selenium and at least one of the following programming languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
* Proven professional background utilizing AI tools to streamline QA processes
* Working knowledge of CI/CD environments, including Jenkins or GitHub Actions

Poor ones generate integration chaos and destroy velocity across multiple teams.
   

  

 You design what you build and operate. You define quality standards and technical patterns for your platform. We follow a spec\\-driven approach: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. Expect high autonomy, zero committees, and no approval boards. You work within a small, cohesive team where accountability for what you ship rests with you.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Define strategic architectural choices and set technical patterns for the team.
* AI Leadership: Champion new AI workflows and develop high\\-value playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the complex, mission\\-critical portions of the codebase with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify that your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality benchmarks.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Functioning as an architect who does not write code
* Spending time in continuous meetings
* Managing personnel (this is a technical leadership position, not a people management role)
* Maintaining legacy systems or internal IT infrastructure


**Basic Requirements**
**Senior Software Architect key responsibilities**
* A minimum of 5 years of professional software development experience creating software products
* At least 3 years serving as either a lead engineer (conducting code reviews) or architect (determining critical technical direction)
* Background working on platform\\-level products where your APIs were consumed by other teams
* Demonstrated commitment to AI tools, consistently experimenting and exploring their limits
