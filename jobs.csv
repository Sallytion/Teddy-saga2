It includes cloud native ways of doing service level patching \\& upgrades and maintaining high availability of the service in the face of random failures \\& planned downtimes in the underlying infrastructure (e.g., for things like patching the Linux kernels to take care of a security vulnerability). Developing systems for monitoring and getting telemetry into the service’s runtime characteristics and being able to take actions on the telemetry data is a part of the charter.
