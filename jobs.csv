 For developers we aim to provide a single manifest deployment and provisioning experience. This allows our developers to declaratively provision the shared services they need, wherever they need them (on\\-prem, cloud, edge) in a self\\-service manner so they can focus on solving real business problems and delivering exceptional value to our customers.
