* Exposure to enterprise integration platforms such as MuleSoft, and data or analytics tools such as Tableau.
* Strong understanding of version control (Git) and collaborative development workflows.
* Ability to take ownership of features from design through production.
* Comfortable working in a fast\\-paced, ambiguous environment with evolving requirements.


 🌟 Nice to Have
   

  

* Experience working with Salesforce platforms (Sales, Service, Experience Cloud, Data Cloud, Analytics, Agentforce)
* Experience building AI\\-assisted tools or integrating with LLM\\-based services.
* Experience building internal developer platforms or enablement tools
* Prior experience supporting internal users at scale (e.g., SEs, Sales, or Ops teams).


 💡 Why This Role Matters
   

  

 This role sits at the core of Salesforce’s demo and enablement ecosystem. The tools you build will directly influence how thousands of sellers showcase Salesforce to customers. You’ll work on meaningful problems that combine scale, usability, and innovation while shaping how internal teams build and deliver demos.
   

  

 Unleash Your Potential
   

  

 When you join Salesforce, you’ll be limitless in all areas of your life. Our benefits and resources support you to find balance and
 *be your best* 
 , and our AI agents accelerate your impact so you can

 Most people have good ideas but are bad at sharing them. Video is the best way to communicate, but it’s too hard. You have to look good, sound good, and not mess up. It takes an hour to make a two\\-minute clip.
 



 Velo fixes this. You write a script, and we do the rest. We move the browser, we provide the face, and we perfect the voice. We turn ""performance"" into ""typing.""
 



  




**The Founding Team**

 Ajay and I have built things before. We are former YC\\-backed founders. We’ve been in the early rooms of very large companies. We are backed by Afore Capital to make Velo the new standard for how professionals talk to each other and have a very strong founding team that has spent years in computer vision and AI
 



  




**The Role**

 We are looking for one person to help us get Velo into the hands of millions. We don't want a traditional marketer. We want a builder who uses marketing as their tool.
 



 Your job is to make Velo inevitable.
 



  





**1\\. SEO and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** 
 The way people search is changing. They don't just use Google; they ask AI. You will build an engine that ensures when someone asks, ""How do I make a product demo?"" or ""What’s the best way to share a slide deck?"", the answer is always Velo. This isn't about keyword stuffing; it’s about becoming the authority.
 



**2\\. Organic Distribution** 
 Velo is a ""viral"" product by nature. Every time someone sends a Velo link, a new person discovers us. You will optimize this loop. You’ll figure out how to make Velo links show up in the right Slack channels, LinkedIn feeds, and Twitter threads without it feeling like ""spam.""
 



**3\\. Multi\\-Channel Experiments** 
 You will run dozens of small tests every week. You might try a new automated outreach tool, a niche influencer campaign, or a custom landing page for Excel users. Most will fail. You are looking for the two or three that work so we can double down on them.
 



  




**What we are looking for** 
* **You are a ""Technical"" Marketer.** 
 You don't need to be a software engineer, but you should be able to use APIs, LLMs, and automation tools to do the work of ten people.
* **You write well.** 
 In a world of AI noise, clear and simple English is a superpower.
* **You are obsessed with the funnel.** 
 You care more about how many people actually
 *create* 
 a Velo than how many people see an ad.
* **You want to be here.** 
 We work from our office in Bengaluru. We move fast. We believe that being in the same room makes the work better and the wins more fun.
* This is a high\\-ownership role. You won't be managed; you'll be a partner in our growth.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/lookupai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHRv3TO6UMSkA/company-logo_100_100/B56Zp9mAm6JsAQ-/0/1763043708060/lookupai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=nuUHbYZiwIk8TIekvD5Fyycp6BRFlOZ27QIDdnne85g","","","","","","","","","","",""
