 Konovo is a global healthcare intelligence company on a mission to transform research through technology\\- enabling faster, better, connected insights.
 



  





 Konovo provides healthcare organizations with access to over 2 million healthcare professionals, the largest network of its kind globally. With a workforce of over 200 employees across 5 countries: India, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and the United States, we collaborate to support some of the most prominent names in healthcare. Our customers include over 300 global pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, research agencies, and consultancy firms.
 



  





 As a Senior Enterprise Software Engineer at Konovo, you’ll play a key role in ensuring performance of the integrated applications with salesforce platform. You’ll partner closely with engineering, DevOps, product teams and key stakeholders.
 



  





 This is a hands\\-on role for someone who thrives in a fast\\-paced, collaborative environment and takes ownership from concept through release. You will be responsible for end to end integration between Salesforce and Sage Intacct, Anaplan, and proprietary systems using Workato and API integrations.
 



  





 The role is based in our innovative Whitefield, Bengaluru office, with a three\\-day in\\-office hybrid schedule designed to foster collaboration and cross\\-team connection. You’ll join a global team that’s rapidly transforming how healthcare research is delivered and experienced.
 



  





 If you’re passionate about building high\\-quality software that supports real\\-world healthcare innovation, this is an opportunity to make a measurable impact on products used globally.
 



  





**How You’ll Make an Impact:** 




  





**Enterprise Architecture \\& Integration** 



* Architect, implement, and maintain integrations across Salesforce, Sage Intacct, Anaplan, and internal platforms using Workato or similar middleware.
* Build holistic, automated workflows that support lead\\-to\\-cash, quote\\-to\\-revenue, financial reporting, planning, and proprietary operational processes.
* Create and maintain data synchronization frameworks ensuring accuracy, consistency, security, and observability.
* Partner with finance, sales operations, data engineering, and product teams to translate business objectives into scalable integration designs.



**Systems Engineering \\& Development** 



* Develop and optimize integrations using REST/SOAP APIs, webhooks, platform events, and event\\-driven patterns.
* Extend enterprise application capabilities through custom logic, scripts, Workato recipes, automation rules, and system\\-specific extensibility features.
* When needed, contribute to Salesforce customizations (Apex, LWC), though the primary focus is on cross\\-system workflows rather than Salesforce specialization.
* Build reusable integration components, templates, and standards to accelerate future development.



**Reliability, Security \\& Performance** 



* Implement monitoring, alerting, and automated recovery strategies for mission\\-critical integrations.
* Ensure compliance with security protocols (OAuth, token management, access control).
* Optimize integrations for scale, performance, and resilience.
* Maintain detailed technical documentation, integration diagrams, and operational playbooks.



**Collaboration \\& Delivery** 



* Work end\\-to\\-end from requirements gathering through deployment and ongoing optimization.
* Partner with DevOps on CI/CD workflows for integration automation and code versioning.
* Contribute to enterprise data governance, quality, and lifecycle management.
* Stay current with best practices across Salesforce, Intacct, Anaplan, and modern integration platforms.



  





**What We’re Looking For:** 




  




* 5–7 years of experience in enterprise application engineering or systems integration roles.
* Demonstrated success integrating at least two of the following:
* Salesforce, Sage Intacct, Anaplan, Netsuite, or proprietary/internal systems.
* Hands\\-on experience with middleware/integration platforms (Workato strongly preferred).
* Strong understanding of integration patterns: REST/SOAP APIs, event\\-driven design, ETL/ELT, data transformations, error handling, and retries.
* Proficiency with system authentication frameworks (OAuth 2\\.0, token\\-based auth).
* Familiarity with SaaS platform constraints, API limits, and scaling considerations.
* Experience with CI/CD, version control, and DevOps tools.
* Knowledge of Apex, LWC, or other application\\-specific languages is a plus (but not the central requirement).
* Background in financial processes or financial systems integration (Intacct) is a significant plus.
* Experience integrating planning systems such as Anaplan
 **,** 
 financial systems such as Intacct, and integration with proprietary applications is highly desirable.



  





**Bonus Skills** 



* Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure).
* Salesforce or Workato certifications are a plus but not required.
* Familiarity with Agile methodologies.



  





**Why Join Konovo?** 



* Join a mission\\-driven organization empowering life science researchers and data scientists with the broadest ecosystem of healthcare audiences and an intelligent, AI\\-enabled platform.
* Work with a fast\\-growing global team and gain exposure across business operations, engineering, and enterprise systems.
* Enjoy a collaborative hybrid workplace designed to foster innovation and continuous learning.
* Benefit from comprehensive employee\\-first policies focused on growth, well\\-being, and balance—including group medical coverage, accident insurance, and a robust leave policy.
* Make a real and lasting impact on how healthcare organizations access insights and accelerate innovation.



  





 If you’re smart, collaborative, and driven to build systems that power real\\-world healthcare transformation, we’d love to hear from you.
