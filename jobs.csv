 We’re building a 
 **cloud\\-based web application** 
  designed to manage and orchestrate virtual environments through an intuitive admin interface. The system enables users to create, configure, and schedule compute resources, manage access, and monitor sessions — all from a single, secure control panel.
 



  





 This is not just another admin dashboard — it’s a 
 **mission\\-critical orchestration tool** 
 , built with a focus on 
 **scalability** 
 , 
 **security** 
 , and 
 **workflow automation** 
 . The platform must support high\\-volume provisioning, secure user\\-resource mapping, and real\\-time management, all while maintaining a clean and reliable user experience.
 



  





**What You’ll Be Working On** 




 You’ll be the
 **developer** 
  on the project — working directly with the 
 **Product Leads** 
 , who brings 25\\+ years of experience in cybersecurity, cloud, and platform design. You’ll get feature direction and support, but you’ll be expected to take full ownership of implementation.
 



  





 You’ll build:
 



 • Dynamic form\\-driven lab creation and configuration flows
 



 • Backend workflows for secure student\\-to\\-VM assignment
 



 • A scheduler engine to auto\\-launch and shut down labs
 



 • Admin panels for managing VMs, monitoring activity, and enforcing quotas
 



 • Backend queues to process high\\-volume VM requests securely
 



 • API integrations with cloud services using best practices for authentication and rate\\-limiting
 



  





**Who We’re Looking For** 




 You’re not just a coder. You’re someone who:
 



 • 
 **Thinks clearly** 
 , communicates well, and asks smart questions when needed
 



 • Has the 
 **common sense to solve problems independently** 
  without getting stuck
 



 • Understands the big picture, but also sweats the details
 



 • Can 
 **read a brief, ask clarifying questions** 
 , and deliver reliable, tested results
 



 • Writes code that’s 
 **clean, modular, and maintainable** 




  





**Tech Stack** 




 • 
 **Frontend:** 
  JavaScript (92\\.6%), HTML, CSS
 



 • 
 **Backend:** 
  Node.js, React.js
 



 • 
 **Database:** 
  MongoDB
 



 • 
 **Cloud Platform:** 
  Azure (used for provisioning, access, and resource control)
 



  





 You don’t need to be an Azure expert — but you must understand 
 **web architecture** 
 , 
 **security\\-first development** 
 , and 
 **how to design systems that scale** 
 .
 



  





**Must\\-Have Skills** 




 • 3\\+ years of full\\-stack web development experience
 



 • Strong knowledge of 
 **JavaScript/Node.js** 




 • Solid understanding of 
 **secure web development** 
 , especially in multi\\-user systems
 



 • Experience working with 
 **queues, scheduling** 
 , and async backend processes
 



 • Knows how to handle 
 **RBAC, tokens, API communication** 
 , and form validation
 



 • Bonus: Familiarity with education platforms or cloud\\-based lab delivery
 



  





**Why This Role Matters** 




 You’ll be building the engine behind a product that powers cybersecurity education across universities — enabling instructors to deliver cloud labs that feel real, safe, and seamless.
 



  





 What you’ll get:
 



 • 
 **Direct collaboration** 
  with the product lead
 



 • A fast\\-moving, supportive startup environment
 



 • The chance to do 
 **meaningful work** 
  in the cybersecurity training space
 



  





**How to Apply**

 • A link to your
