**About Destro AI:** 




 Destro AI is building the global intelligence layer for robotics — the agentic decision\\-making brain that tells any robot 
 *what to do, when, and why* 
  across complex warehouse workflows. While most robotics companies focus on autonomy and sensors, Destro solves the real bottleneck: robots don’t understand workflows.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 





 We’re looking for a Founding Software Engineer who can take ownership of our fragmented codebases — and productionize, integrate, and harden it into a robust, scalable, enterprise\\-ready solution that can run in both cloud and on\\-prem environments. This is a mission\\-critical role where you’ll work directly with the founding team, own deployment architecture, and prepare the stack for live enterprise pilot launches.
 





  
 




**What You’ll Own:** 



* Refactor MVP codebases into a unified, modular platform
* Build backend APIs, scalable services, and data flows using Python
* Own DevOps, CI/CD, and infrastructure for on\\-prem and cloud\\-native deployments
* Containerize everything (Docker, Kubernetes)
* Build secure auth, RBAC, and observability for production readiness
* Implement real\\-time data processing, MQTT/gRPC APIs, Redis streams, etc.



  





**Tech Stack (you should be fluent with most):** 



* Backend: Python, Node.js
* Frontend: React, TypeScript
* DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes
* Cloud: AWS, GCP
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions or similar
* Infra: Linux, Postgres, MQTT, gRPC, Redis, APIs
* Bonus: Robotics/IoT deployments, RTLS integration, or wearable UX



  





**What We’re Looking For:** 



* Have 2 \\- 4 years of experience in full stack/backend/devops roles
* Have shipped real enterprise or infra products — bonus if in hybrid or on\\-prem setups
* Know how to write good code across microservices and edge devices
* Be excited to work on AI for the physical world, not just cloud dashboards
* Care deeply about reliability, observability, and uptime
* Be able to move fast, own outcomes, and work independently



  





**Why Join Destro:** 



* Real\\-world AI \\+ Robotics
* Global Tech Exposure: Work with ex\\-Dexterity, ex\\-HAI Robotics, and NYU alumni, alongside top US retailers and 3PLs
* Equity \\+ Ownership: As a founding engineer, you’ll earn meaningful equity and have massive technical say
* Career\\-Defining Work: You’re building the brain that controls fleets of robots — from day one","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/destroaiautomation","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGr0sHAY80Yvw/company-logo_100_100/B4EZiZ45meGUAQ-/0/1754928487137/destroaiautomation_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=2V8Wey3n_Tl-ER9IMKEZD1xzUqNYCxQSnaqiNqi-sWM","","","","","","","","","","",""

 **Fresh Prints** 
 . Fresh Prints is a New York\\-based, fast\\-growing, fully remote, 150\\-person company with most of our team based in India and the Philippines. A few years ago, Fresh Prints began helping other fast\\-growing companies build their teams. We got so good at it that we spun out a new company to focus exclusively on that — and called it
 **Frontier**

 At Frontier, we help companies grow full\\-time, cross\\-functional teams abroad. We hire the smartest people and place them into the best companies. In three years, we've never lost a client. If you're interested in a Frontier role and you apply and are accepted, we'll screen you through a couple of internal interviews and aim to get you an interview for a full\\-time job within the month.

**About Mura**
 Mura is an early stage, venture\\-backed startup helping commercial HVAC providers accelerate and automate their billing cycle. Commercial HVAC companies currently manage their billing out of offline PDFs, spreadsheets, email, and third party portals. Mura streamlines the process so that companies get paid faster and are able to scale without hiring more people.
   

  

 Mura has automated over
 ***100,000 invoices***
 in the past few months and closed 18 customers \\- including the
 ***largest PE\\-backed operator***
 in the space. The field service software market is a $170B\\+ opportunity, and we're building the category\\-defining company.
   

  

 Mura's co\\-founders previously started LeafLink, a b2b cannabis marketplace that was backed by investors including Founders Fund, Lerer Hippeau, and Thrive Capital. LeafLink now moves 80% of the wholesale cannabis orders in the U.S. ($20B\\+). The team at Mura deeply understands b2b orders, and is excited to dive into a similar problem in commercial HVAC.
   

  

**The Role: Founding Engineer**
 As one of the first engineers at Mura, you will play a key role in building the product that our customers are interacting with day\\-to\\-day, and the platform on which we will grow moving forward.
   

  

 This is not just a coding role. You will be expected to deeply understand the customer's needs and make product decisions. You will need to architect systems with an eye to efficient scaling, help with customer launches, analyze data, and generally perform what tasks are necessary for Mura to consistently deliver more value to customers.
   

  

 You will also be writing a lot of code. As a result of being an early stage startup, we wouldn't want to hide this reality to prospective candidates: raw hours actually make a big difference in the impact we can make right now. This won't always be the case but it is at present. So, often we find ourselves working later in the evening, and occasionally during the weekend.
   

  

**Existing Tech Stack** 
  

  

* Backend:
+ Python hosted on AWS ECS
+ Postgres Database
+ We use different LLMs depending on the use case

* Frontend:
+ NextJS TypeScript hosted on Vercel


**Key Responsibilities**
* Own product feature development from specification to successful launch to iterating until it meets the metrics we are trying to reach.
* Building integrations into new field service management systems (FSMs \\- our customers' system of record) to expand Mura's total addressable market.
* Work on infrastructure improvement projects, like speeding up our CI or deployment process.
* Periodically handle on\\-call duties to make sure we never have extensive downtime for our customers.


**Qualifications**
* Writes clean, reusable code
* Good systems design understanding and knowledge
* Cares about product outcomes, not just engineering outcomes
* Excellent communicator
* Thrives in uncertainty


**What's Offered**
* Competitive salary
* The best tutorial on starting a company you can find. Twice\\-successful founders that are transparent and collaborative on the direction of the company
