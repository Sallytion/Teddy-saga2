 We’re looking for a 
 
 dynamic, full‑stack software engineer
 
  who’s excited by ambiguity, motivated by impact, and energized by building from first principles. This is an early‑stage role at an ambitious startup in the recruiting space, where you’ll help shape both the product and the engineering culture.
 



 You’ll work across the stack 
 
 alongside a long‑tenured software engineer from Google
 
  and collaborate closely with 
 
 highly motivated, creative, and experienced business leaders who have built successful companies and products
 
 . Together, you’ll take real ownership over meaningful parts of the system and help turn big ideas into production‑ready software.
 



 If you’re hungry to learn fast, comfortable wearing many hats, and not afraid to ask questions or challenge assumptions, you’ll feel right at home.
 



  




 What You’ll Do
 * Own and ship end‑to‑end features across frontend, backend, and infrastructure.
* Build product experiences using 
 
 Flutter
 
  and modern web/mobile patterns.
* Design and implement backend services in 
 
 Python
 
  and 
 
 Rust
 
 , with a focus on correctness, performance, and clarity.
* Work with 
 
 LLMs
 
 , embeddings, and 
 
 vector databases
 
  to build intelligent, AI‑assisted workflows.
* Integrate and deploy services using 
 
 Cloudflare
 
  (Workers, Pages, queues, etc.).
* Use 
 
 GitHub Spec‑Kit
 
  and similar tools to plan, spec, and reason about systems 
 *before* 
  building them.
* Write clean, well‑tested, maintainable code and participate actively in code reviews.
* Collaborate asynchronously with a fully remote team, communicating progress, blockers, and ideas clearly.
* Take responsibility for large pieces of the product and follow them through from concept to production.



  




 What We’re Looking For
 

 You might be a great fit if you:
 



* Have 
 
 2–3\\+ years of experience
 
  as a software engineer in a fast‑paced startup or similarly high‑ownership environment.
* Are comfortable moving across the stack and learning new technologies quickly.
* Have working knowledge of some (not necessarily all) of the following:
* Flutter
* Python
* Rust
* Cloudflare (or comparable serverless / edge platforms)
* Vector databases, embeddings, or modern AI/ML tooling
* Understand the value of planning, writing specs, and thinking through tradeoffs before writing code.
* Ask thoughtful questions, communicate clearly, and enjoy collaborating with others.
* Take ownership seriously: when something breaks or needs improvement, you see it through.
* Are creative, curious, and motivated by building something meaningful from the ground up.



  




 Nice to Have (But Not Required)
 * Experience building AI‑powered or LLM‑driven products.
* Familiarity with recruiting, HR tech, or workflow automation tools.
* Contributions to open‑source projects or strong personal side projects.
* Experience designing systems for scale, reliability, or performance.



  




 Our Culture \\& How We Work
 * Remote‑first
 
  and async‑friendly.
* Small team, high trust, high ownership.
* We value clear thinking, good writing, and honest communication.
* We plan carefully, but move fast once we commit.
* You’ll have real influence on product direction and technical decisions.



  




 Why This Role Is Different
 
 This is not a narrowly scoped ticket‑taking role. You’ll help define 
 *what* 
  we build, not just 
 *how* 
 . If you’re excited by early‑stage energy, modern AI‑driven tooling, and the chance to grow alongside a product from the beginning, this role offers a rare level of impact and learning.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/fasmac","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF4N62VU8Vzgg/company-logo_100_100/B56Zw4ynsFHAAQ-/0/1770479320790/fasmac_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=wIU-pmoKnNpUdnPliK7FR7yh0iGd82wny5VAfdlWBgM","","","","","","","","","","",""
