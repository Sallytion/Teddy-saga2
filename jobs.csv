 At Trensor AI, we’re building the next generation of agentic AI frameworks — systems that can reason with structure, learn with clarity, and act with awareness.
 




  






 Our mission is to bring discipline, reliability, and explainability to autonomous reasoning — starting with domains like compliance automation, where logic matters as much as intelligence itself.
 




  






 We’re now looking for a few AI/ML Engineer Interns to join us on this journey of structured innovation.
 




  






 🚀 What You’ll Work On
 





 • Designing and implementing agentic AI workflows using LangChain, LangGraph, and related orchestration frameworks
 





 • Experimenting with RAG pipelines, LLM\\-based reasoning, and multi\\-agent coordination
 





 • Building integrations across data pipelines, backend systems, and microservices to support adaptive reasoning
 





 • Collaborating closely with the founding team on research, design, and architecture
 





 • Exploring how AI can move from prediction to reasoning — acting with awareness, not automation
 




  






 🧩 What We’re Looking For
 





 • Strong Python proficiency and experience in AI/ML workflows
 





 • Familiarity with LangChain, LangGraph, RAG, orchestration, or willingness to learn fast
 





 • Curiosity about agentic systems and reasoning frameworks
 





 • Ability to pick up new technologies and architectures quickly
 





 • (Bonus) Knowledge of backend (FastAPI, Flask) or frontend (React, Next.js)
 





 • A mindset that values clarity, structure, and reasoning in engineering
 




  






 🌱 Why Join Us
 





 → Work directly with the founders from IIT Delhi and IIT Kanpur on deeptech challenges
 





 → Gain hands\\-on experience in agentic AI, reasoning systems, and orchestration architectures
 





 → Access to the IIT and deeptech ecosystem for mentorship and growth
 





 → Learn cutting\\-edge frameworks shaping the next wave of AI development
 





 → Flexible, exploration\\-driven work environment
 





 → Performance\\-based full\\-time opportunity after internship
 




  






 If you’re someone who:
 





 – Thinks deeply about how intelligence can be structured
 





 – Loves connecting logic, data, and design
 





 – And believes AI should reason as well as it learns then this is your space.
