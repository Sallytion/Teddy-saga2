 As a
 **QA Test Engineer** 
 , you will play a critical role in ensuring the quality, reliability, and performance of our software products. You will be deeply embedded in the product development lifecycle — collaborating with developers, product managers, and designers to build quality into the product from the ground up.
   

  

 You will define and implement testing strategies, develop automation frameworks, and perform exploratory testing to ensure every release meets the highest standards of quality and user experience.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
**Your role and responsibilities**
* Champion quality throughout the development lifecycle — from story definition to post\\-release validation.
* Work in an Agile, collaborative environment to design, recommend, and implement testing standards and best practices.
* Collaborate early in story development and design discussions to ensure testability, edge cases, and failure scenarios are well\\-considered.
* Perform functional, integration, regression, and exploratory testing to uncover product issues before release.
* Partner closely with developers and product owners to identify, reproduce, and triage defects, ensuring clear root cause analysis and sustainable fixes.
* Drive the adoption and expansion of test automation — including unit, integration, API, and end\\-to\\-end tests.
* Develop and maintain automated test frameworks and reusable test assets aligned with product architecture and CI/CD pipelines.
* Contribute to continuous testing and continuous delivery practices, ensuring that every build meets product\\-grade quality standards.
* Monitor product quality through test analytics, defect metrics, and release readiness criteria.
* Collaborate with cross\\-functional teams to ensure test environments, data, and tooling are reliable and scalable.
* Actively identify quality gaps and propose innovative solutions to improve product resilience and customer satisfaction.

 Master's Degree
   

  

**Required Technical And Professional Expertise**
**Required Skills and Experience**
* Strong experience in manual and automated testing within an Agile product development environment.
* Proficiency with one or more test automation frameworks (e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, or similar).
* Hands\\-on experience with API testing tools such as Postman, Newman, or REST Assured.
* Familiarity with continuous integration and delivery pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
* Solid understanding of software QA methodologies, test design techniques, and defect management practices.
* Working knowledge of programming or scripting languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, or Java) for writing automated tests.
* Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) and collaboration tools (e.g., Jira, Confluence).
* Strong analytical and debugging skills with attention to detail and product behavior.
* Experience testing web\\-based applications, APIs, and microservices.

 Whatfix is an AI platform advancing the “userization” of enterprise applications, empowering companies to maximize the ROI of their digital investments. Technology needs adoption. It’s no different for AI. As AI reshapes roles, workflows, and human\\-machine interactions, it also introduces new layers of complexity and user friction. This is where Whatfix plays a pivotal role. A decade old DNA of empowering people to succeed with technology and not replacing them. We call this philosophy
 **Userization** 
 : the belief that technology must adapt to the user, not the other way around.
   

  

 At the heart of userization philosophy is
 **ScreenSense** 
 , our proprietary AI engine, which continuously interprets both the context of what users are doing in an application or an AI tool and the intent behind their actions. By combining these signals, Whatfix delivers real\\-time guidance, nudges, knowledge, and automation directly in the flow of work.
   

  

 This intelligence powers our entire product suite.
   

  

* Digital Adoption helps users get productive faster.
* Product Analytics uncovers friction and closes adoption gaps.
* Mirror allows employees to train in safe, simulated environments.


 These are embedded with Whatfix
 **AI Agents** 
 which supercharge creation, insights, and user guidance.
   

  

 Our upcoming
 **AI\\-first products** 
 are already creating a buzz in the market.
   

  

* Seek is an AI\\-native assistant that not only knows your business context but can also act across applications to get work done on your behalf.
* Whatfix Mirror 2\\.0 is the world’s only System plus Role simulation with a complete assessment to lead the Gen AI simulation category.


 Together, these products reflect Whatfix’s commitment to building enterprise\\-ready AI teammates that maximize productivity and ROI. It gives users a unified, intelligent way to find answers across systems, apps, and knowledge silos and helps anyone looking to deliver fast and contextual answers.
   

  

 Whatfix is bridging the gap between rapid technological change and human enablement—ensuring AI is not only embedded but also usable, trusted, and outcome\\-driven for every employee.
   

  

 At Whatfix, we’re not just making software easier—we’re making AI work for people.
   

  

 The company has seven offices across the US, India, UK, Germany, Singapore, and Australia and a presence across 40\\+ countries.
   

  

**Customers**
