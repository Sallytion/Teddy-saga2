**Why Join Us?**
 BestEx Research's Bangalore office is not an ""offshore center."" It's a core engineering and research hub—working on the exact same problems and projects as our U.S. team. You'll be part of the global brain trust, solving some of the hardest problems in trading, systems, and data science.
   

  

**What You'll Love:**
* Zero bureaucracy, zero silos—engineers directly collaborate with traders, researchers, and the CEO
* Direct ownership and end\\-to\\-end visibility on production systems
* Daily opportunity to learn from pioneers in HFT, low\\-latency systems, and algo trading
* A high\\-trust environment where performance speaks louder than hierarchy
* Competitive compensation in India, including equity and cash bonuses
* 5\\-week structured training program:


**Your Role: Build What Most Engineers Never Get to Touch**
* Market microstructure and trading mechanics

* Exchange simulators and performance testing
* Market data systems and real\\-time analytics
* Hands\\-on exercises using production research data
* Continuous professional development, with refresher courses, advanced sessions, and on\\-demand training tailored to your growth

 You'll be part of a lean, focused team building ultra\\-low\\-latency trading systems, real\\-time exchange simulators, execution algorithms, and alpha forecasting models. Our engineers own the stack—from C\\+\\+ nanosecond\\-sensitive infrastructure to Python\\-based research platforms.
   

  

 This role is ideal for someone who thrives at the intersection of research and engineering—comfortable building systems, testing hypotheses, and working directly with data that moves markets.
   

  

**What You'll Work On**
* Architect and implement:
* Execution algorithms across global markets
* Exchange simulators and tick\\-level backtesting frameworks
* Smart Order Routing systems across lit and dark venues
* Models for market impact, price prediction, and volume forecasting
* High\\-performance trading systems optimized for throughput and latency
* Core infrastructure to support new asset classes and global markets
* Collaborate closely with global quants, traders, and senior engineers
* Analyze system performance across app, OS, and hardware layers


**Requirements**
**You Should Have**
* Bachelor's or Master's from a top\\-tier CS, Math, or Engineering program (IIT/NIT/BITS preferred but not required)
* 5\\+ years hands\\-on C\\+\\+ experience (C\\+\\+14/17/20\\) in performance\\-sensitive applications
* Strong fundamentals in data structures, OS, networks, and concurrency
* Python fluency for data analysis and prototyping (preferred but not required)
* Experience with large\\-scale, real\\-time systems (trading experience is a plus but not mandatory)
* Passion for learning—markets, systems, and modeling


**Bonus Points For**
* Deep experience with TCP/IP, multi\\-threading, and latency optimization
* Prior work on trading platforms, FIX engines, or exchange protocols
* SQL optimization and experience with research or market data pipelines
* Contributions to open\\-source C\\+\\+/Python performance tools


**Benefits**
**Why This Role Is Rare**
* Exposure to real\\-time trading systems live in global markets
* Direct mentorship from senior algorithmic trading and software engineering veterans
* Blend of research, systems design, and algorithm development
* Equity and cash compensation
* Zero red tape, no outsourcing mentality","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/bestex-research-group","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGLJjWJzBi3Bw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1732133302988/bestex_research_group_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=cX8hqi9VJ6j4Ut3mV9LixCQpxEG2_WsaMdrOInjZWAE","","","","","","","","","","",""
