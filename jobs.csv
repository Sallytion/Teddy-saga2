* Data quality \\& governance: Implement validation, deduplication, translation/localization flows, taxonomy/GS1 alignment, and error handling/reconciliation.
* Performance, scale, and resilience: Tune jobs, parallelize loads, manage retries/back\\-pressure, and monitor SLAs.
* DevEx \\& reliability: Unit/integration tests, CI/CD, secrets management, observability (logs/metrics/traces), and documentation/runbooks.
* Client collaboration: Participate in discovery, demos, technical workshops, UAT support, hypercare, and handover to Managed Services.
* Security \\& compliance: Apply least\\-privilege, OAuth2/JWT, PII handling, and auditability standards.

* Demonstrated experience integrating with ERP (SAP/Oracle/Dynamics) and E\\-Commerce (Magento/Adobe, Shopify, SFCC, BigCommerce, commercetools).
* Comfortable with data modeling for PIM: attributes, families, variants, reference entities, asset management, channels/locales, completeness.
* Solid understanding of product taxonomy, GS1 standards, localization/translation workflows, and SEO attributes.
* Hands\\-on with queues, idempotent job design, error handling, and reconciliation patterns.
* Knowledge of security best practices (OAuth2, JWT, secrets, network policies).
