**Role Type:** 

 Full\\-time  \\| 
 
**Location:** 

 Onsite \\| 
 
**Stack:** 

 Python
 




  





  




**About the Role** 

  





 The Company We are building a vertically integrated, AI\\-native operating platform for institutional real estate investment. The platform automates and connects every stage of the investment lifecycle — from acquisition through renovation, leasing, and refinance — replacing manual processes with code, AI, and SaaS integrations. Remote\\-first, no on\\-ground employees.
 



  





 How We Build Software We follow an automation\\-first hierarchy: code first, then specialized AI, then LLMs, then offshore humans, then US contractors. Humans are the last resort, not the first option. All feature work follows a spec\\-driven development approach. You write specs, orchestrate Claude Code agents, review output, and iterate. You are an engineer who directs AI, not a typist who writes every line by hand. If you think what took an hour still takes an hour or AI coding tools are a gimmick, this is not the role.
 



  




**What You'll Do** 
* Build and deploy AI agents and automation workflows for real estate operations (underwriting, document processing, lead qualification, contractor coordination, etc.)
* Design multi\\-step agent architectures with tool\\-calling, structured outputs, retries, fallbacks, and human\\-in\\-the\\-loop escalation
* Build Python microservices that expose AI capabilities via REST APIs to the main platform
* Implement cost management and token optimization across all LLM usage
* Convert manual/human tasks into AI\\-automated workflows based on detailed process specs
* Work with the product team to identify which of our 178 mapped tasks can be shifted from Human to AI
* Monitor, evaluate, and improve agent performance with metrics and logging


**Requirements** 
* 5\\+ years professional Python backend engineering (not scripting or notebooks)
* Production experience with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) — not demos or tutorials
* Experience with agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or custom)
* Strong understanding of structured outputs, function/tool calling, and prompt engineering for deterministic behavior
* Experience designing and deploying microservices with REST APIs
* Ability to build robust error handling, retry logic, and fallback patterns for non\\-deterministic AI systems
* Cost\\-aware: experience managing token budgets and optimizing LLM spend
* Comfortable with remote async work across time zones
* Spec\\-driven mindset: can take a detailed process spec and translate it into working automation


**Nice to Have** 
* Experience with real estate, proptech, or financial services automation
* Familiarity with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipelines
* Experience with document parsing/extraction (OCR, PDF processing)
* Knowledge of vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector)
* Experience with Claude Code or similar AI\\-assisted development workflows


**This Role Is NOT** 
* A fullstack/frontend role — you will not build UI or work on the Next.js platform
* A data science or ML training role — we use pre\\-trained LLMs, not custom models
* A no\\-code automation role — this is real engineering, not Zapier workflows
* A research role — you ship production systems, not papers","Wellness and Fitness Services","https://kw.linkedin.com/company/masaj-co","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQED1zQkkWdGIg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1655373729137?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7wAKeOsHd-vxgZbT19vXDabzUqdTKgtXysQfxLQ07b8","","","","","","","","","","",""
