 Our leading SaaS\\-based Global Employment Platform™ enables clients to expand into over 180 countries quickly and efficiently, without the complexities of establishing local entities. At G\\-P, we’re dedicated to breaking down barriers to global business and creating opportunities for everyone, everywhere.
   

  

 Our diverse, remote\\-first teams are essential to our success. We empower our Dream Team members with flexibility and resources, fostering an environment where innovation thrives and every contribution is valued and celebrated.
   

  

 The work you do here will positively impact lives around the world. We stand by our promise: Opportunity Made Possible. In addition to competitive compensation and benefits, we invite you to join us in expanding your skills and helping to reshape the future of work.
   

  

 At G\\-P, we assist organizations in building exceptional global teams in days, not months—streamlining the hiring, onboarding, and management process to unlock growth potential for all.
   

  

**About The Position**
 Join our GIA Experience Team as a Senior Full Stack Engineer where you'll work across the entire stack—crafting beautiful React interfaces and architecting robust backend services. You're someone who thrives when the path isn't perfectly clear, takes ownership of problems from inception to solution, and naturally mentors others while shipping great code.
   

  

**What You Will Do**
**Frontend Development** 
 : You'll lead the charge on building interfaces that users actually want to use. Working with React 18\\+ and TypeScript, you'll create component libraries that other developers will thank you for, ensure our app works flawlessly across browsers, and make accessibility a first\\-class citizen. You'll integrate with our APIs, implement those smooth animations that make users smile, and maybe even dabble in voice interactions.
   

  

**Backend Development** 
 : On the server side, you'll build scalable backend services in Python (running on AWS) and Go that can handle whatever our users throw at them. You'll design APIs that are both powerful and intuitive, manage infrastructure using AWS services like ECS/EKS and Lambda, and ensure everything is secure, observable, and thoroughly tested.
   

  

**Keeping Standards High** 
 : You'll establish CI/CD pipelines that just work, champion testing practices that catch bugs before they escape, and conduct code reviews that help everyone level up. Performance monitoring isn't an afterthought—it's baked into everything you build.
   

  

**Leading Through Collaboration** 
 : You'll work closely with product managers who dream big, UX designers who obsess over details, and AI/ML engineers who push boundaries. You'll mentor mid\\-level engineers not just in code, but in thinking like a product engineer. And when you spot opportunities to prototype AI\\-enhanced features that could be game\\-changers, you'll make it happen.
   

  

**What Makes This Role Unique**
* You’ll join a small, startup\\-structured team within the larger G\\-P organization.
* Passionate about building and defining early stage products.
* You’ll be helping to build GIA from the ground up — shaping both the product and the underlying tech
* We’re seeking individuals with a strong product mindset and expert\\-level engineering skills
* You must thrive in fast\\-paced, ambiguous environments where direction isn’t always handed to you
* You’ll need to be highly independent and self\\-directed
* Must know how to identify what to build next, without always being told
* Expect to wear multiple hats and contribute across the stack
* While collaboration is essential, you must also lead as an individual contributor


**Important Note**
 If you’re not prepared to operate at this level or aren’t excited by the challenge — this role may not be the right fit.
   

  

**Minimum Requirements**
**What We Are Looking For:**
* 6\\+ years of building web applications that people use, with solid experience on both frontend and backend
* You know React 18\\+ inside and out, and you're comfortable with the entire modern JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
* Strong Python skills with AWS experience
* You've designed APIs (REST and/or GraphQL) that other developers enjoy working with
* Hands\\-on experience with AWS services, Docker, and infrastructure as code
* You've built CI/CD pipelines and understand why observability matters


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Practical Go experience for backend development
* Experience with BFF patterns, GraphQL federation, or service mesh architectures
* React Native or cross\\-platform mobile development
* AI/ML integration experience (prompt management, LLM feedback loops)
* AWS certifications
* Kubernetes and event\\-driven architectures (Kafka, SQS)
