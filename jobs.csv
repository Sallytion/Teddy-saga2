 MaxLinear is a global, NASDAQ\\-traded company (MXL) where the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well. We are a fabless system\\-on\\-chip product company, striving to improve the world’s communication networks for everyone through our highly integrated radio\\-frequency (RF), analog, digital, and mixed\\-signal semiconductor solutions for access and connectivity, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multi\\-market applications.
   

  

 We hire the best people in the industry and engage them in some of the most exciting opportunities that connect the world we live in today. Our growth has come from innovative, bold approaches to solving some of the world’s most challenging communication technology problems in the most efficient and effective manner.
   

  

 MaxLinear began by developing the world’s first high\\-performance TV tuner chip using standard CMOS process technology. Others said we couldn’t achieve the extremely high\\-performance requirements using CMOS, but we proved them wrong and achieved enduring global market leadership with our designs. Since then, we’ve developed a full line of products that drive 4G and 5G infrastructure; enable data center, metro and long\\-haul optical interconnects; bring 10Gbit to the home; power the IoT revolution; and enable robust and reliable communication in harsh industrial environments. Over the years, we’ve expanded through organic growth and through several acquisitions that have perfectly complemented our existing portfolio and enabled us to deliver complete end\\-to\\-end solutions in our target markets. One such example was the acquisition of Intel’s Home Gateway Platform Division that added Wi\\-Fi, Ethernet, and Broadband Gateway Processor SoC technology to our connected home portfolio creating a complete and scalable platform of connectivity and access solutions to fully address our customers’ needs.
   

  

 Our headquarters are in Carlsbad, near San Diego, California. We also have major design centers in Irvine and San Jose, California; Valencia, Spain; Bangalore, India; Munich, Germany; Israel; and Singapore.

* Exploring and experimenting with new technologies to keep us ahead of the curve in fintech innovation.



  





**Who You Are**



* Engineering graduate from a Tier\\-1 institute (IITs or equivalent).
* Based in Gurgaon or willing to relocate.
* Proven experience building and scaling products end\\-to\\-end — ideally in fintech or adjacent industries.
* Strong technical depth in front\\-end (React Native/React.js) and/or back\\-end (Node.js/Express.js, Firebase, or similar).
* Experience leading small teams or projects, with the ability to mentor engineers and enforce high\\-quality standards.
* Passionate about fintech — especially around lending, investments, or mutual funds.
* Thrive in early\\-stage environments where speed, creativity, and ownership matter more than hierarchy.
* Bonus: Knowledge of investment platforms, lending models, or financial products.



  





**What We Offer**



* Competitive base pay
* Meaningful Equity (ESOPs): Be a co\\-creator in our journey, not just an employee.
* Leadership from Day One: Drive technology choices and shape how fintech experiences are built in India.
* Career Growth: Opportunity to grow into Head of Engineering/CTO as the company scales.
* High Impact: Every decision you make will directly influence how thousands (and soon millions) use fintech daily.","Financial Services","https://in.linkedin.com/company/1fi","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQEN7FhvDJ6d2A/company-logo_100_100/B4DZe3VLb5HMAQ-/0/1751127472503/1fi_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=mkTNBa_MS61zgR9gRFEY38b17w-zLmmX2oVJREGyCRU","","","","","","","","","","",""

**What You’ll Do:** 



* Implement and refine features in production\\-grade Rust codebases.
* Diagnose, debug, and resolve ownership, borrowing, and concurrency challenges.
* Design comprehensive tests (unit, integration, property\\-based) to enforce safety.
* Improve development environments, dependencies, and performance.
* Document trade\\-offs and guide architectural decisions.



  





**What We’re Looking For:** 



* 2\\+ years of professional Rust within 3\\+ years total industry experience.
* Strong grasp of ownership, lifetimes, async/multithreading, and memory safety.
* Skilled in Rust testing frameworks, profiling, and debugging.
* Ability to refactor and improve large Rust codebases.
* Excellent problem\\-solving skills and clear English communication.



  





**Why You'll Love This Role:** 



* Remote \\& Flexible → Work from anywhere, on your schedule.
* Career Edge → Build deep Rust expertise at the intersection of systems and AI.
* High\\-Impact Work → Shape how frontier AI models learn safe, concurrent Rust.



  





**About Turing:** 




 Based in San Francisco, California, Turing is the world’s leading research accelerator for frontier AI labs and a trusted partner for global enterprises deploying advanced AI systems.
 



  





**Turing supports customers in two ways:** 
 first, by accelerating frontier research with high\\-quality data, advanced training pipelines, plus top AI researchers who specialize in software engineering, logical reasoning, STEM, multilinguality, multimodality, and agents; and second, by applying that expertise to help enterprises transform AI from proof of concept into proprietary intelligence with systems that perform reliably, deliver measurable impact, and drive lasting results on the P\\&L.
