**More about us:\\-**
**Process Automation**
 At the heart of this seeming ‘magic’ in the background is process automation – orchestrating production and enabling safe and efficient operations of some of the most complex and vast infrastructures on our planet. For nearly 50 years, automated measurement and control of plants and processes have been central to empowering the industries that provide the basic building blocks of our everyday lives – power, water, metals, minerals, chemicals, transportation – to reliably meet our needs.
   

  

**Digital and Genix™:**
 Industrial AI and analytics combined with Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) brings together artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning models, and advanced analytics tools to extract actionable insights from massive amounts of industrial data in order to optimize production and manufacturing processes. Industrial AI and analytics applied on industrial data can help organizations to make informed decisions, boost operational efficiency, predict maintenance needs, enable faster decision\\-making, foster innovation, and improve sustainability and safety standards.
   

  

 There’s a big difference between having data and making it work. Less than 20% of data generated by industrial companies is actually used. Even less is analyzed. This means up to 80% of data is simply lost. ABB is changing that. ABB Genix™ combines the power of industrial analytics and artificial intelligence into an enterprise\\-grade digital platform and suite. Genix unlocks the value of contextualized data through IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things), improving industrial productivity and operational excellence.
   

  

 Genix unlocks the true value of industrial data by seamlessly integrating Operational Technology (OT), Information Technology (IT), and Engineering Technology (ET) across all layers of the enterprise. The platform helps unify siloed data, scale digital initiatives efficiently, and align technology outcomes with business goals — enabling companies to evolve into intelligent, agile, and future\\-ready enterprises.

We own the world's largest dataset of this kind, enabling field users and customers to make smarter, more efficient decisions about their assets and operations. Our purpose is to deliver transformative commercial and environmental outcomes, helping global clients across utilities, telecoms, retail and energy improve pricing accuracy, speed up delivery, ensure safety, and maintain compliance.
 



  





 Join our team as a senior backend or full\\-stack engineer with shared responsibility for the development and operation of our SaaS offering, with special focus on the development of integration services to integrate the core platform with different enterprise tools in the CRM, Customer Service, Field Service, Asset Management, Facilities Management, and other related areas. Write software in python, javascript or other languages as needed. Take design responsibilities for features. Contribute to the overall system design. Communicate with customers, investors and the rest of our business to identify opportunities for innovation.
 



  





**Technologies**




 Mobile and Web apps are used to capture, manipulate and view structured multimedia data. This data is uploaded to our public cloud systems. Then analysed using machine learning, computer vision, LLM (and Vision\\-Language models) and other technology. Our AI decision making agents combine with various integrations to support decisions for users, and in other systems, to drive important field workflows.
 



  





  





 We are continually enhancing the data collection and computer vision and AI capabilities of our platform. Our team includes multiple specialists who are developing and improving our AI capabilites. As well as a wide range of other software engineers to provide our full offering.

We use Django rest framework and Postgresql to provide our primary REST API interface. Our web\\-app is built using react. We also have android and ios native apps. Our platform is primarily AWS. Our platform has a pluggable architecture coordinated using queues. Work is distributed to a variety of processing systems and smaller services. We use a combination of commodity analytics APIs (e.g.) and bespoke AI algorithms and models (e.g. aws transcribe, google speech, aws rekognition, claude, tensorflow, bedrock, RT\\-DETR) to provide advanced multi\\-step multi\\-modal speech, image and video analytics. We use aws\\-lambda, docker, ECS, api gateway, aws\\-step\\-functions and other tools to implement various video processing, ML and other AI applications.
 



  





 As you would expect, our system also provides various collaboration, administration, management and security related features around the central video capture and analytics. We offer both shared and dedicated deployments of the software; by defining all of our infrastructure as code we are able to easily deploy dedicated copies of our entire system into dedicated VPCs for our large customers. Many of our customers have stringent security requirements around their video data, so we use a variety of modern systems to provide security and monitoring across our networks and applications.

**Role Overview:** 




 We are seeking an AI Prompt \\& Policy Specialist to help design, evaluate, and improve how AI systems interact with tools, APIs, and users across multiple locales. In this role, you will work at the intersection of prompt engineering, policy design, and safety, ensuring that AI\\-driven workflows are accurate, compliant, and user\\-friendly.
 



 You will use your API/JSON literacy, SQL basics, policy creation skills, and strong critical reasoning to review, refine, and design prompts and behaviors for AI systems interacting with products like Slack, PayPal, and other third\\-party tools. This role also requires strong communication skills and awareness of safety and content filtering, especially across a wide range of languages and locales.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day life look like?** 



* Design, review, and refine prompts and instructions for AI systems interacting with tools, APIs, and external services.
* Read and understand API/JSON schemas and arguments to ensure correct parameter usage and tool behavior.
* Apply SQL basics to validate data, perform simple checks, and support analysis of AI or tool behavior.
* Create, document, and maintain policies and guidelines governing AI interactions, content handling, and tool workflows.
* Develop workflow knowledge for specific tools (e.g., Slack, PayPal and similar platforms) and encode that into prompts and policies.
* Ensure safety and compliance by applying content filtering guidelines and detecting unsafe or non\\-compliant outputs.
* Evaluate AI responses for critical reasoning quality, correctness of parameters, and adherence to policies.
* Support multilingual use cases by validating prompts and responses across multiple locales, with attention to nuance and clarity.
* Collaborate with product, engineering, and safety teams to iterate on prompts, policies, and workflows based on evaluation findings.
* Document edge cases, decision rationales, and recommendations with clear, concise written communication.
