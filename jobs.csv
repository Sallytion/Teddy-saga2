 See Below For a Couple Of Anecdotes, Should You Want To Hear a SDE’s Perspective On What It Is Like To Work In This Team
   

  

 “I have worked on other global tech platforms at Amazon prior to SmartConnect and what I find extremely different and satisfying here is that in addition to the scale and complexity of work that I do and the customer impact it has, I am part of a team that makes SDEs owners of critical aspects of team functioning – whether it be designing and running engineering excellence programs for design reviews, COE, CR, MCM and Service launch bar raisers or the operational programs for the team. This has allowed me to develop myself not just on the tech or domain as a SDE but also as a wholesome Amazon tech leader for future challenges.”
   

  

 “It is extremely empowering to be a part of this team where I am challenged to learn and innovate in every project that I work on. I get to work across the tech stack and have end to end ownership of solution and tech choices. I hadn’t worked on as many services in my previous team at Amazon as I have built from scratch, launched and scaled in this team . The team is in a great place where it is connected to customers closely, is building new stuff from scratch and has to deal with very light Ops burden due to the great architecture and design choices that are being made by SDEs”
   

  

**About The Team**
 SmartConnect team located in Bangalore is looking for a SDE to deliver strategic goals for Amazon eCommerce systems. This is an opportunity to join our mission to build tech solutions that empower sellers to delight the next billion customers. If you feel excited by the challenge of setting the course for large company wide initiatives and building and launching customer facing products in international locales, this may be the next big career move for you. We are building systems which can scale across multiple marketplaces. We are looking for a SDE to design and build our tech stack as a coherent architecture and deliver capabilities across marketplaces. We operate in a high performance co\\-located agile ecosystem where SDEs, Product Managers and Principals frequently connect with end customers of our products. Our SDEs stay connected with customers through seller/FC/Delivery Station visits and customer anecdotes. This allows our engineers to significantly influence product roadmap, contribute to PRFAQs and create disproportionate impact through the tech they deliver.
