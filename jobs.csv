 Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.
   

  

 In\\-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in\\-office workdays.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Notion is a company of toolmakers. To build the best tools for our users, we need the best tools for ourselves.
   

  

 You'll join a new team dedicated to building and improving Admin Mode—Notion's internal platform used by hundreds of employees across Customer Experience, Trust \\& Safety, Engineering, and other teams. Admin Mode is critical infrastructure and it's accessed daily by teams supporting millions of Notion users. You'll take ownership of a platform that directly impacts the productivity of every team at Notion.
   

  

**You'll Directly Impact**
* Notion's entire operational efficiency as the company scales
* Customer Experience agents who rely on Admin Mode to support users
* Trust \\& Safety teams protecting Notion users from abuse and security threats
* Every engineering team that uses admin tools to debug and resolve issues


**What You'll Achieve**
* Rebuild the foundation: Redesign Admin Mode's UI/UX to consolidate scattered workflows, reduce time\\-to\\-resolution for user issues, and make critical tools discoverable and fast.
* Own reliability: When Admin Mode goes down, customer support grinds to a halt—you'll make sure it doesn't.
* Enable extensibility: Build standardised APIs, permission testing utilities, and scaffolding that lets any team quickly add new admin tools.
* Build tools: Collaborate cross\\-functionally with internal teams to transform ambiguous problem statements into tools that streamline their workflows.


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Tech stack: Node.js/TypeScript and React/TypeScript
* 5\\+ years of experience leading and contributing to full stack applications working with cross\\-functional stakeholders.
* You care about internal tools. You understand that developer experience and operational efficiency aren't nice\\-to\\-haves—they're force multipliers. You get excited about shaving 20 seconds off a workflow that runs 80 times per day.
* You have deep empathy for users. You'll be building for Customer Experience agents resolving 50\\+ tickets daily, Trust \\& Safety investigators handling time\\-sensitive cases, and engineers debugging production issues at 2am. Understanding their workflows matters as much as the code.
* You're a systems thinker. Admin Mode touches user accounts, workspace data, billing, security, and more. You need to think through permissions, audit trails, and edge cases—not just ship features fast.
* You collaborate across teams. 90% of Admin Mode tools are owned by different engineering teams. You'll need to build consensus, establish standards, and communicate changes that affect deeply ingrained workflows.
* You don’t need to be an AI expert, but you’re curious and willing to adopt AI tools to work smarter and deliver better results.


**Nice To Haves**
* Having worked with LLMs and build real world applications.
* Familiarity with TypeScript, Node.js, React


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

 What You’ll Do
   

  

* Build and own AI\\-backed features end to end, from ideation to production — including layout logic, smart cropping, visual enhancement, out\\-painting and GenAI workflows for background fills
* Design scalable APIs that wrap vision models like BiRefNet, YOLOv8, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, ControlNet, etc., into batch and real\\-time pipelines.
* Write production\\-grade Python code to manipulate and transform image data using NumPy, OpenCV (cv2\\), PIL, and PyTorch.
* Handle pixel\\-level transformations — from custom masks and color space conversions to geometric warps and contour ops — with speed and precision.
* Integrate your models into our production web app (AWS based Python/Java backend) and optimize them for latency, memory, and throughput
* Frame problems when specs are vague — you’ll help define what “good” looks like, and then build it
* Collaborate with product, UX, and other engineers without relying on formal handoffs — you own your domain****
 What You’ll Need
   

  

* 2–3 years of hands\\-on experience with vision and image generation models such as YOLO, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, Stable Diffusion, VITON, or TryOnGAN — including experience with inpainting and outpainting workflows using Stable Diffusion pipelines (e.g., Diffusers, InvokeAI, or custom\\-built solutions)
* Strong hands\\-on knowledge of NumPy, OpenCV, PIL, PyTorch, and image visualization/debugging techniques.
* 1–2 years of experience working with popular LLM APIs such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and how to compose multi\\-modal pipelines
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
* Experience solving real\\-world visual problems like object detection, segmentation, composition, or enhancement.
* Ability to debug and diagnose visual output errors — e.g., weird segmentation artifacts, off\\-center crops, broken masks.
* Deep understanding of image processing in Python: array slicing, color formats, augmentation, geometric transforms, contour detection, etc.
* Experience building and deploying FastAPI services and containerizing them with Docker for AWS\\-based infra (ECS, EC2/GPU, Lambda).
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
* A customer\\-centric approach — you think about how your work affects end users and product experience, not just model performance
* A quest for high\\-quality deliverables — you write clean, tested code and debug edge cases until they’re truly fixed
* The ability to frame problems from scratch and work without strict handoffs — you build from a goal, not a ticket


 Who You Are
   

  

* You’ve built systems — not just prototypes
* You care about both ML results and the system’s behavior in production
* You’re comfortable taking a rough business goal and shaping the technical path to get there
* You’re energized by product\\-focused AI work — things that users feel and rely on
* You’ve worked in or want to work in a startup\\-grade environment: messy, fast, and impactful


 What You Get
   

  

* Full autonomy over your problem space
* A builder\\-first, no\\-handoff culture
* Remote\\-first flexibility (India preferred)
* Base \\+ Variable \\+ meaningful equity
* A product shipping to some of the world’s most recognizable brands
