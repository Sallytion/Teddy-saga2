* Build, refine, and maintain configuration, policy, and automation for platforms such as Microsoft Intune, Jamf, Windows Autopilot, and related endpoint and identity management services.
* Develop, maintain, and iterate on scripts, automations, and runbooks (e.g., PowerShell or bash scripting) to improve consistency, reduce manual effort, and eliminate repeatable pain points for end users and support teams.
* Perform advanced troubleshooting and root cause analysis for issues related to EUX\\-owned or EUX\\-influenced services, including escalations from End User Support and other IT teams.
* Contribute to security enforcement at the endpoint and access layers (for example: MFA behavior, device compliance posture, app registration hygiene, local admin controls, data protection on laptops and mobile devices) while balancing usability and business impact.
* Document solutions, standards, procedures, and operational expectations so that End User Support and other delivery teams can successfully support and sustain EUX\\-managed capabilities.
* Provide structured knowledge transfer, cross\\-training, and guidance to End User Support, ensuring that new or changed solutions are adopted without creating single points of failure.
* Participate in evaluation, pilot, and rollout planning for new capabilities, including impact assessment, change readiness, communication needs, and adoption considerations.
* Monitor, interpret, and report on metrics, telemetry, or usage patterns for EUX\\-owned solutions to identify friction, stability issues, security gaps, or opportunities to retire legacy tooling.
* Ensure EUX solutions and recommendations align with corporate technology standards, security policies, identity governance requirements, regulatory expectations, and licensing strategies.
* Perform other duties as assigned that support the mission, vision, values, and objectives of Duck Creek Technologies and the End User Experience \\& Engineering function.
