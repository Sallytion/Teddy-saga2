 Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.
   

  

 Rippling Payroll is redefining how companies pay their people across the world — turning payroll from a cost center into a strategic advantage. Built on Rippling Unity — our unified workforce platform — Payroll connects HR, IT, and Finance so every policy, approval, and pay calculation automatically stays in sync across systems and countries.
   

  

 With $750M\\+ ARR, \\>23,000 customers, and \\>$70B in annualized payroll volume, we’re building the most intelligent, automated, and compliant payroll infrastructure on the planet.
   

  

****The Opportunity****
 We’re looking for a
 ****Senior Staff Software Engineer****
 to help architect and scale Rippling’s
 ****next\\-generation Global Payroll Platform****
 — a system that powers payments, compliance, and computation for millions of employees across 50\\+ countries.
   

  

 This role sits at the intersection of
 ****AI\\-powered automation****
 ,
 ****compliance\\-as\\-code****
 , and
 ****massive scale****
 — with direct ownership over core systems that define how Rippling processes global payroll, taxes, and payments at sub\\-second latency and near\\-zero error tolerance.
   

  

**What You’ll Own**
* Architect Rippling’s next\\-gen Payroll computation engine — modular, extensible, and capable of encoding multi\\-jurisdictional compliance logic declaratively.
* Design data models and pipelines that handle versioned pay runs, audit trails, retroactive corrections, and time\\-based computations at global scale.
* Build scalable rules engines to automate ever\\-changing tax, benefits, and labor laws across jurisdictions, ensuring compliance through dynamic, AI\\-generated logic.
* Modernize global payment infrastructure for real\\-time or near\\-instant disbursements while balancing reconciliation, fraud detection, and regulatory constraints.
* Evolve reporting and permissions systems to deliver real\\-time insights and granular access controls for complex, multi\\-entity organizations.
* Partner with Product, Compliance, and Finance teams to convert ambiguous regulatory specs into clear, deterministic system behavior.
* Lead high\\-impact initiatives like sandboxed “simulation” payrolls, AI\\-powered paystub explainability, and what\\-if analysis for enterprises.
* Shape the long\\-term platform vision, influencing 150\\+ engineers across Finance and HR Infrastructure as a multiplier, mentor, and architectural authority.


**What Success Looks Like**
* System Reliability: Sub\\-second computation accuracy for global pay runs, with zero critical compliance defects.
* Extensibility: New countries, pay types, and tax rules added with minimal engineering overhead.
* Performance: Orders of magnitude improvement in latency and cost efficiency across distributed computation.
* Developer Velocity: Simplified APIs, testing frameworks, and onboarding for internal and partner developers.
* Business Impact: Reduction in country onboarding time, payroll failure rates, and manual compliance interventions.


**What We’re Looking For**
* 14\\+ years of experience building large\\-scale distributed systems in high\\-compliance or high\\-integrity domains (Finance, Payroll, Tax, Insurance, etc.).
* Deep expertise in data architecture, domain\\-driven design, and rule\\-based / event\\-driven systems.
* Experience scaling compliance\\-heavy, multi\\-country systems — ideally payroll, tax, or financial computation platforms.
* Proficiency in designing modular service boundaries, ensuring backward compatibility and auditability.
* Strong understanding of computation correctness, versioned state, precision handling, and retroactive adjustments.
* Proven ability to partner across functions — translating legal/compliance constraints into elegant, maintainable systems.
* A strong architectural voice who can both design systems and mentor teams to scale them sustainably.


****Bonus Points****
* Experience with AI\\-driven system automation or compliance\\-as\\-code frameworks.
* Hands\\-on work with global payroll systems, real\\-time payments, or statutory tax logic.
* Familiarity with event sourcing, CQRS, streaming pipelines, and immutable data stores.
* Contributions to open\\-source distributed computation frameworks or rule engines.


****Why Rippling****
* Backed by world\\-class investors (Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, Bedrock, GIC, Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs)
* Valued among the fastest\\-growing SaaS companies in history
* Build at the heart of Rippling’s Finance platform, where Payroll, Spend, Bill Pay, and Banking converge into a unified ecosystem.
* Join a team that pushes the limits of possible, builds winning systems, and moves fast with conviction.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/rippling","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGVw6UsjqtXGw/company-logo_100_100/B4EZlN73QeHIAQ-/0/1757949162831/rippling_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=_-PZ3E8XmdCyc89UhLvip3soyI97bY1FRM89cZYXEiQ","","","","","","","","","","",""
