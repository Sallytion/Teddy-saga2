 We're looking for builders who've already discovered the secret: AI coding tools aren't the future—they're the present. If you've been using Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or similar tools to ship features at velocities your peers can't match, we want to talk.
 



 You'll join a team building a multi\\-faceted application platform where every sub\\-application is designed AI\\-first. We don't just use AI to write code—we build products that put AI capabilities directly in our users' hands.
 



**What You'll Do** 



* Build production applications at high velocity using AI\\-assisted development workflows
* Design and ship AI\\-first features across our platform's sub\\-applications
* Experiment relentlessly—new tools, new prompting techniques, new ways to leverage AI in development
* Collaborate with a team that treats hackathon energy as the default operating mode
* Shape our AI development practices and help teammates level up their AI coding skills



**Tech Stack** 



* **Backend:** 
 Python, Django, FastAPI
* **Database:** 
 PostgreSQL
* **Infrastructure:** 
 Azure App Service
* **AI Tooling:** 
 Claude Code, Cursor, and whatever else makes you faster



**What We're Looking For** 




**Must Have:** 



* Demonstrable experience building and shipping applications using AI coding tools—show us what you've built, how fast, and how AI helped
* Strong Python fundamentals (Django or FastAPI experience preferred)
* Comfort working with PostgreSQL and cloud deployments
* Ability to work UK shift hours
* A portfolio, GitHub, or demos that showcase your AI\\-augmented development work



**You'll Stand Out If You:** 



* Have hackathon wins or notable side projects built with AI assistance
* Can articulate your ""vibe coding"" workflow—how you prompt, iterate, and ship
* Have experimented with multiple AI coding tools and formed opinions about what works
* Contribute to or follow the AI coding community (Twitter/X, Discord, YouTube creators)
* Enjoy teaching others and sharing what you've learned



**What We Don't Care About** 



* Years of experience (velocity matters more than tenure)
* Traditional CS credentials (show us what you can build)
* Whether you learned to code ""the hard way"" first (results \\> purity)



**Location \\& Work Setup** 




**Chandigarh TriCity Area** 



* Fully onsite
* Collaborate in\\-person with a high\\-energy team



**NOIDA** 



* Flexible hybrid (currently 2 days in office, subject to change)



**Work Hours:** 
 UK Shift
 



**How to Apply** 




 Skip the generic cover letter. Instead, show us:
 


1. **A project you built using AI coding tools** 
 — What was it? How long did it take? What would it have taken without AI?
2. **Your AI coding setup** 
 — What tools do you use? What's your workflow?
3. **A short video or write\\-up** 
 (optional but encouraged) — Walk us through how you work with AI to ship code fast



**Interview Process** 




**Step 1: Quick Intro Call** 
*(Remote)* 




 We'll chat briefly, you'll pick your challenge, and we'll align on scope expectations. No trick questions—just making sure we're a good fit for each other.
 



**Step 2: The Build** 
*(Remote, 2 hours)* 




 Choose your adventure:
 



*Nostalgic / Approachable* 



* **Library Management System** 
 — Revive your first college project, now with AI superpowers
* **Expense Splitter** 
 — Track shared expenses, calculate who owes whom
* **Quiz Engine** 
 — Create quizzes, take them, track scores
* **Contact Book** 
 — Searchable, taggable, exportable (address book 2\\.0\\)



*Developer Tools* 



* **API Key Keeper** 
 — Secure storage and management for API credentials
* **Webhook Catcher** 
 — Receive, log, and inspect incoming webhooks
* **Environment Config Manager** 
 — Store, version, and compare env variables
* **Health Check Dashboard** 
 — Monitor endpoints, show status, log history
* **Feature Flag Service** 
 — Simple on/off toggles with an API



*Practical Business Apps* 



* **Invoice Generator** 
 — Create, preview, and export invoices as PDF
* **Booking Slot Manager** 
 — Availability windows \\+ booking logic
* **Feedback Collector** 
 — Embeddable form, submissions dashboard, export



*Fun / Creative* 



* **Link\\-in\\-Bio Builder** 
 — Generate a profile page with links (like Linktree)
* **Daily Standup Bot** 
 — Async standup collector with summaries
* **Mood Tracker** 
 — Log entries, visualize trends over time
* **Recipe Scaler** 
 — Input a recipe, scale ingredients up/down



*Spicy / Complex* 



* **URL Shortener with Analytics** 
 — Shorten links, track clicks, show stats
* **Markdown Blog Engine** 
 — Write in markdown, render as HTML, basic routing
* **Rate Limiter Service** 
 — Configurable limits per API key, with tracking



*Hour 1:* 
 You're on your own. Build in your environment, with your tools, your way.
 



*Hour 2:* 
 We join via screen\\-share. We'll watch how you work—how you prompt, debug, iterate, and ship. This isn't surveillance; it's so we can have a meaningful conversation afterward.
 



 Bring your own setup. Use Claude Code, Cursor, whatever makes you fastest. We want to see your real workflow.
 



**Step 3: Debrief** 
*(Remote)* 




 We'll talk through your approach: what worked, what didn't, how you made decisions, and how you'd improve given more time. This is a conversation, not an interrogation—we're genuinely curious about how you think and build.
 



**Step 4: Meet the Team** 
*(Onsite)* 




 You've shown us how you build. Now let's meet face\\-to\\-face. You'll visit our office, meet the team, get a feel for the culture, and we'll talk through the role, expectations, and what working together looks like. This is as much for you as it is for us.
 



  





  





*We're building for a future where AI amplifies human capability. If that excites you, let's talk.*
