 Internship
 



**Work Mode:** 
 WFH (Welcome to WFO if you’re in Hyderabad)
 



  






 We’re 
 
**ZocialOne** 

 , building the future of social media marketing. We believe small businesses shouldn’t need agencies, designers, or marketers to grow online. We build AI\\-powered marketing software that helps businesses create, schedule, and manage content across Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Business, and more — all from one place.
 




  






 This isn’t a demo app or a prototype. We run a 
 
**production Flutter app trusted daily by high\\-value power users to run and grow their businesses** 

 . Our product is already used by 
 
**100,000\\+ businesses** 

 , and every line of code impacts real
 
 businesses
 
 .
 




  




 Core Outcome of This Internship
 
**Convert our existing production Flutter mobile app into a production\\-ready Flutter Web application.**

 ·       Curiosity about performance optimization
 





 ·       Interest in how production apps scale
 




  





**What We Expect from You** 





 We’re not a 9\\-to\\-5 or task\\-ticket culture. We move fast, build fast, and fix fast.
 





 ·       Take ownership of the work you do
 





 ·       Learn quickly and figure things out independently
 





 ·       Care deeply about product quality — performance, UI, and UX
 





 ·       Be open to feedback and iteration
 





 ·       Step up when things need fixing
 




  





**You’ll learn by doing and taking ownership, supported by the team whenever you need help.**

 ·       Strong portfolio value from working on a live product
 





 ·       Quality\\-first culture with no red tape — just build
 




  






 ﻿
 
 👉
 **High\\-performing interns will be considered for full\\-time roles** 
 based on ownership, execution, and impact.
 



  





**Not a Fit If** 





 ·       You need micromanagement
 





 ·       You want a slow or comfortable environment
 





 ·       You prefer bureaucracy over building
 




  





**In short** 





 If you want to learn by building, work on a 
 
**production Flutter Web app** 

 , and grow fast in a startup where your work genuinely matters —

 About the Role
 



 We are looking for a
 **Technical Program / Pilot Analyst**

 **humanoid robotics pilots** 
 focused on HVAC, facilities, and industrial environments.
 



 This is a
 **hands\\-on, execution\\-focused role** 
 working directly with the founder on real customer discovery calls with
 **mining, pharma, facilities, and industrial companies** 
 . The work involves
 **analyzing real\\-world operations, documenting pilot requirements, and helping shape product and business decisions** 
 .
 



 This is
 **not a research internship and not a pure coding role** 
 . It is about understanding how technology fits into real operations.
 



  





 What You Will Do
 


* Prepare for and attend customer discovery calls (listening, note\\-taking, structured follow\\-ups)
* Analyze operational workflows, constraints, and pain points
* Identify inspection, monitoring, safety, and labor\\-reduction opportunities
* Convert conversations into
 **clear 1–2 page pilot briefs**
* Help map customer needs to:
* HVAC inspection MVP scope
* data center / industrial applicability
* Support internal planning for robotics pilots and early go\\-to\\-market efforts
* Assist with documentation used for BD, product planning, and partner discussions



 Who This Role Is For
 


* Recent graduates, graduate students, or early\\-career professionals (0–3 years)
* Background in:
* engineering (mechanical, electrical, systems, robotics, computer science), or
* applied AI, automation, industrial systems
* Strong ability to:
* listen carefully
* synthesize complex discussions
* write clearly and concisely
* Comfortable working with ambiguity and incomplete information
* Interested in
 **applied robotics, industrial automation, and real\\-world AI deployment**



 Nice to Have (Not Required)
 


* Exposure to robotics, automation, HVAC, facilities, manufacturing, or industrial operations
* Experience with technical documentation, product analysis, or consulting\\-style work
* Comfort participating in professional customer calls (listening role)



 What This Role Is NOT
 


* Not a research or academic role
* Not a pure software engineering role
* Not a sales or marketing role
* Not a guaranteed long\\-term position



 This is a
 **short, focused execution role** 
 designed to support real pilots.
 



  





 Why This Is a Good Opportunity
 


* Direct exposure to early\\-stage robotics and AI pilots
* Work closely with a repeat founder
* Learn how pilots, MVPs, and customer discovery actually work
* Strong resume signal for robotics, AI, product, or consulting paths
* Flexible, remote\\-friendly structure","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/emedsim","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQGvk4D6hM9YnA/company-logo_100_100/B4DZowwfeaKIAU-/0/1761754610718/emedsim_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=OKDZVUnbSl8dkWqffMH161_JXALkxObpbE7rnsykCU4","","","","","","","","","","",""
