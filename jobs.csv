 At CoverForce, we're on a mission to transform the insurance industry by making it faster and easier for businesses to get the coverage they need. Now is the perfect time to join our team and help shape the future of insurtech. Thousands of insurance agents and corporate customers depend on our tools to simplify quoting, comparing, and buying insurance policies. We partner with top insurers like Travelers, Liberty Mutual, and Chubb to streamline underwriting and sales, cutting the time spent on a single insurance policy by 75%.
   

  

**Our Innovative Solutions Include**
* Quote and Bind Platform: Trusted by several of the Top 100 insurance distributors in the US, our platform lets agents generate and purchase business insurance quotes with a single click, saving time and eliminating repetitive paperwork. Carriers also use it to digitally empower their appointed agencies.
* Embedded Commercial Product: This allows partners like Walmart, Gusto, and Uber to offer business insurance directly through their platforms using our API. It also integrates with other Agency Management Systems to enhance their quote and binding capabilities.


 We're positioned to be the central API for insurance distribution, much like how Plaid has transformed banking. Whether through our user\\-friendly web platform or our powerful API, CoverForce is here to make insurance purchasing easy, digital and efficient. Join us and be part of a team that's dedicated to innovation and excellence. We are headquartered in New York City and have our engineering team based in India.
   

  

**The Opportunity**
 As an engineer at CoverForce, you will work on designing and implementing the core infrastructure of the API platform. You will work on Carrier Integrations, partner integrations, developing the CoverForce engine, and other core features of the product. As we build out our Public API, you will be involved in discussions about the structure, models, synchronicity, and other key decisions of a complex Public facing API.
   

  

 This role is a perfect fit for an engineer who thrives in fast\\-paced environments looking to build a product from the ground up. You will have the opportunity to take ownership and wear many hats as you develop the product. As an early engineer, you'll impact product development, system architecture, engineering culture, and more. You will work across the stack building out our centralized API and the front\\-end portal.
 **We use ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, Docker, and Javascript/Typescript on AWS.**
 Our product was inspired by talking with 100s of agents and identifying the critical pain points in the quote, bind, and payment process. We see our solution scaling to independent agencies, agency management systems, and corporate customers.
   

  

**Tasks Will Include**
* Integrating with Insurance carriers
* Researching the API of an insurance carrier.
* Designing a solution to integrate with the carrier

* Collaborate cross\\-functionally to solve business problems and continue to support our rapid growth


**What We Are Looking For**
 We are looking for strong, independent engineers who would like to work in a fast\\-paced environment with lots of responsibility and scale. We have open roles for Backend and Frontend engineers. Ideal candidates will have prior startup experience and the ability to build systems from scratch.
   

  

**To succeed in this role, you have**
* Strong ownership mentality – You take initiative, see projects through from start to finish, and treat the codebase and product as if you built the company yourself
* Exceptional communication skills – You can clearly articulate technical problems, propose solutions, and collaborate effectively across teams. You understand that in a startup, clear pro\\-active communication is as important as clean code
* Intellectual curiosity and learning agility – You're excited to dive into unfamiliar territory, whether it's insurance domain knowledge, a new carrier's API, or an emerging technology. You ask questions, seek to understand the ""why,"" and continuously expand your skill set
* Comfort with ambiguity – You thrive in environments where requirements evolve, and you can navigate complex systems that require deep domain context
* Pragmatic approach to AI tooling – You actively leverage and experiment with the latest AI development tools (like Cursor, Claude, GitHub Copilot) to accelerate your work and aren't afraid to build on top of LLM APIs to solve business problems
* Quality\\-focused craftsmanship – You take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and understand that good testing empowers rather than burdens the team
* 3\\+ years of production software development experience – Ideally with backend systems (RESTful APIs, databases) and modern web technologies


**Nice To Have, But Not Essential**
* Previous startup experience and understanding of the rapid pace and evolving priorities
* Production experience with our tech stack: Node, TypeScript, React, MongoDB
* Familiarity with AWS or other cloud environments
* Experience working with external APIs and third\\-party integrations


**What CoverForce Offers**

 Peklenc Research comes under
 *YNAPS* 
 , a global business group that encompasses diverse ventures such as
 **NGF132 (Featured in Shark Tank India Season\\-5 ep12\\)** 
 (Sampark.me) with offices in Spain, the USA, and India. We build execution\\-first products with strong engineering discipline: shipping, reliability, and measurable outcomes.Its a great opportunity to work with leading startup implicating real world impact, and have a career growth unmatched.
 



 About the role
 



 We’re building a
 **multi\\-tenant, multi\\-channel** 
 ,
 **real\\-time logistics operations SaaS platform** 
 where reliability under peak traffic matters. We’re hiring a
 **Senior Backend Engineer / Tech Lead** 
 who will take end\\-to\\-end responsibility:
 **architecture → development → shipping → monitoring → ongoing reliability** 
 , and can lead a small team to deliver production outcomes.
 



 This is
 **not** 
 a CRUD\\-only backend role. We need someone who can design and operate stable real\\-time systems in production.
 



 What you’ll do (Core Responsibilities)
 


* **Own the backend architecture** 
 : data model, APIs, multi\\-tenant isolation, and real\\-time event flow.
* Build and operate the
 **real\\-time pipeline** 
 (ingestion → processing → fanout) using
 **SSE/WebSockets \\+ pub/sub/queues** 
 , including reconnection and late\\-join behavior.
* Design
 **fanout stability** 
 : throttling/backpressure, send\\-latest\\-only, reconnect storm protection, graceful shutdown during deploys, and controlled broadcast cadence.
* Implement
 **hot\\-path state \\& caching** 
 using
 **Redis** 
 (latest\\-state snapshots, rate limiting, pub/sub triggers) with failure\\-safe patterns.
* Build durable source\\-of\\-truth storage on
 **Postgres** 
 : schema design, migrations, indexing, transaction safety, and performance tuning.
* Implement
 **multi\\-tenant security \\& isolation** 
 end\\-to\\-end: tenant scoping from auth/session, enforced DB filtering, audit logs, and per\\-tenant quotas/rate limits.
* Drive
 **production readiness** 
 on AWS: CI/CD, staging parity, safe rollouts, dashboards/alerts, incident playbooks, and fast rollback practices.
* Can use modern coding assistants/agents to ship faster.(claude code) generate faster, but validate with
 **tests, logging/metrics, code review discipline, and production readiness** 
 .
* Collaborate closely with DevOps/SRE to design and validate scaling and reliability for peak windows.
* Lead execution with a small support team.



 Must\\-have
 


* **4\\+ years backend experience** 
 with
 **real production ownership** 
 (deployments, monitoring, incidents, rollbacks).
* Implemented
 **realtime systems in production** 
 (SSE and/or WebSockets) with stability mechanisms such as:
* throttling/backpressure, send\\-latest\\-only, reconnect backoff/jitter, graceful shutdown/draining, degrade/load\\-shedding modes.
* **Strong production experience with:**
* **Redis** 
 (hot\\-path caching/state, rate limiting, pub/sub triggers; plus monitoring/alerts like latency/evictions/memory headroom).
* **Postgres** 
 (schema design, migrations, indexing, query performance, transaction/locking basics).
* **Event\\-driven / async processing** 
 experience in production:
* queues/pubsub such as
 **SQS/SNS/EventBridge** 
 , Kafka, or similar,
* retries/backoff, idempotency, DLQs.
* **AWS production working knowledge** 
 (enough to ship and operate backend services):
* ECS/Fargate (or equivalent), ALB, CloudWatch, RDS, ElastiCache, SQS, Secrets Manager/SSM (WAF is a bonus).
* Strong engineering judgment: can clearly explain tradeoffs between
 **latency vs cost vs reliability** 
 and choose pragmatic solutions for launch.



**Nice\\-to\\-have (Strong Bonuses)** 



* Terraform / Infrastructure as Code collaboration (not necessarily writing all infra, but can work cleanly with Terraform\\-based environments).
* Kubernetes exposure (bonus; not required for launch).
* High\\-concurrency connection systems (10k–100k\\+ connections) or reconnect storm handling experience.
* Built internal ops/admin tools (tenant lookup, audit logs, revoke/rotate tokens/credentials).
* Cost\\-control patterns for external APIs (caching, batching, quotas, fallbacks).","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://in.linkedin.com/company/peklenc-research","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQHaLqeN5uso7g/company-logo_100_100/B4DZuxtGqjJ4AU-/0/1768212950353?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=f2D8MFpORyRpJm3DKBUjuQ2oP87nHt2nizM5zojAOTc","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Turing is one of the world’s fastest\\-growing AI companies accelerating the advancement and deployment of powerful AI systems.
 



  





**Turing helps customers in two ways:** 
 Working with the world’s leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, multilinguality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and leveraging that work to build real\\-world AI systems that solve mission\\-critical priorities for companies.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 This position is within a project with one of the foundational LLM companies. The goal is to assist these foundational LLM companies in enhancing their Large Language Models.
 



  





 One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high\\-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine\\-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.
 



  





 For example, in the case of Agent Completion (AC) data generation, your task will be to simulate high\\-quality multi\\-turn conversations between a user and a smart assistant that utilizes function\\-calling tools to accomplish user goals. You will craft these dialogues by playing both the assistant and the user, while simulating tool use where necessary to guide the assistant through complex decision\\-making and real\\-world reasoning scenarios.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day look like:** 



* Design multi\\-turn conversations that simulate real interactions between users and AI assistants using apps like calendar, email, maps, and drive.
* Emulate both the
 **user** 
 and the
 **assistant** 
 , including the assistant's tool calls (only when corrections are needed).
* Carefully select when and how the assistant uses available tools, ensuring logical flow and proper usage of function calls.
* Craft dialogues that demonstrate natural language, intelligent behavior, and contextual understanding across multiple turns.
* Generate examples that showcase the assistant’s ability to gracefully complete feasible tasks, recognize infeasible ones, and maintain engaging general chat when tools aren’t required.
* Ensure all conversations adhere to defined formatting and quality guidelines, using an internal playbook.
* Iterate on conversation examples based on feedback to continuously improve realism, clarity, and value for training purposes.
* Collaborate with peers and reviewers to maintain consistency and high standards in deliverables.



  





**Requirements:** 



* Strong general
 **technical reasoning skills** 
 and the ability to model real\\-world assistant behavior using tool\\-based APIs.
* Ability to break down complex tasks and simulate realistic dialogues that reflect user expectations and assistant limitations.
* Experience in
 **any programming language or tech stack** 
 is acceptable; a strong grasp of APIs, data formats (e.g., JSON), and logical thinking is more critical than specific toolsets.
* Excellent written communication skills in English, with a focus on clarity, tone, and instructional coherence.
* Creativity and attention to detail in crafting realistic scenarios and responses.
* Experience working with or around LLMs, virtual assistants, or function\\-calling frameworks is a plus.
* Ability to follow detailed guidelines and formatting standards with high consistency.
* 3\\+ years of overall professional experience in a technical or analytical field.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing:** 



* Work in a fully remote environment.
* Opportunity to work on cutting\\-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.



  





**Offer Details:** 



* **Commitments Required** 
 : At least 4 hours per day and minimum 20 hours per week with overlap of 4 hours with PST. (We have 3 options of time commitment: 20 hrs/week, 30 hrs/week or 40 hrs/week)
* **Engagement Type** 
 : Contractor assignment (no medical/paid leave)
* **Duration of Contract** 
 :
 **6 Weeks**

 Turing is one of the world’s fastest\\-growing AI companies accelerating the advancement and deployment of powerful AI systems.
 



  





**Turing helps customers in two ways:** 
 Working with the world’s leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, multilinguality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and leveraging that work to build real\\-world AI systems that solve mission\\-critical priorities for companies.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 This position is within a project with one of the foundational LLM companies. The goal is to assist these foundational LLM companies in enhancing their Large Language Models.
 



  





 One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high\\-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine\\-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.
 



  





 For example, in the case of Agent Completion (AC) data generation, your task will be to simulate high\\-quality multi\\-turn conversations between a user and a smart assistant that utilizes function\\-calling tools to accomplish user goals. You will craft these dialogues by playing both the assistant and the user, while simulating tool use where necessary to guide the assistant through complex decision\\-making and real\\-world reasoning scenarios.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day look like:** 



* Design multi\\-turn conversations that simulate real interactions between users and AI assistants using apps like calendar, email, maps, and drive.
* Emulate both the
 **user** 
 and the
 **assistant** 
 , including the assistant's tool calls (only when corrections are needed).
* Carefully select when and how the assistant uses available tools, ensuring logical flow and proper usage of function calls.
* Craft dialogues that demonstrate natural language, intelligent behavior, and contextual understanding across multiple turns.
* Generate examples that showcase the assistant’s ability to gracefully complete feasible tasks, recognize infeasible ones, and maintain engaging general chat when tools aren’t required.
* Ensure all conversations adhere to defined formatting and quality guidelines, using an internal playbook.
* Iterate on conversation examples based on feedback to continuously improve realism, clarity, and value for training purposes.
* Collaborate with peers and reviewers to maintain consistency and high standards in deliverables.



  





**Requirements:** 



* Strong general
 **technical reasoning skills** 
 and the ability to model real\\-world assistant behavior using tool\\-based APIs.
* Ability to break down complex tasks and simulate realistic dialogues that reflect user expectations and assistant limitations.
* Experience in
 **any programming language or tech stack** 
 is acceptable; a strong grasp of APIs, data formats (e.g., JSON), and logical thinking is more critical than specific toolsets.
* Excellent written communication skills in English, with a focus on clarity, tone, and instructional coherence.
* Creativity and attention to detail in crafting realistic scenarios and responses.
* Experience working with or around LLMs, virtual assistants, or function\\-calling frameworks is a plus.
* Ability to follow detailed guidelines and formatting standards with high consistency.
* 3\\+ years of overall professional experience in a technical or analytical field.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing:**

 Turing is one of the world’s fastest\\-growing AI companies accelerating the advancement and deployment of powerful AI systems.
 



  





**Turing helps customers in two ways:** 
 Working with the world’s leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, multilinguality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and leveraging that work to build real\\-world AI systems that solve mission\\-critical priorities for companies.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 This position is within a project with one of the foundational LLM companies. The goal is to assist these foundational LLM companies in enhancing their Large Language Models.
 



  





 One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high\\-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine\\-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.
 



  





 For example, in the case of Agent Completion (AC) data generation, your task will be to simulate high\\-quality multi\\-turn conversations between a user and a smart assistant that utilizes function\\-calling tools to accomplish user goals. You will craft these dialogues by playing both the assistant and the user, while simulating tool use where necessary to guide the assistant through complex decision\\-making and real\\-world reasoning scenarios.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day look like:** 



* Design multi\\-turn conversations that simulate real interactions between users and AI assistants using apps like calendar, email, maps, and drive.
* Emulate both the
 **user** 
 and the
 **assistant** 
 , including the assistant's tool calls (only when corrections are needed).
* Carefully select when and how the assistant uses available tools, ensuring logical flow and proper usage of function calls.
* Craft dialogues that demonstrate natural language, intelligent behavior, and contextual understanding across multiple turns.
* Generate examples that showcase the assistant’s ability to gracefully complete feasible tasks, recognize infeasible ones, and maintain engaging general chat when tools aren’t required.
* Ensure all conversations adhere to defined formatting and quality guidelines, using an internal playbook.
* Iterate on conversation examples based on feedback to continuously improve realism, clarity, and value for training purposes.
* Collaborate with peers and reviewers to maintain consistency and high standards in deliverables.



  





**Requirements:** 



* Strong general
 **technical reasoning skills** 
 and the ability to model real\\-world assistant behavior using tool\\-based APIs.
* Ability to break down complex tasks and simulate realistic dialogues that reflect user expectations and assistant limitations.
* Experience in
 **any programming language or tech stack** 
 is acceptable; a strong grasp of APIs, data formats (e.g., JSON), and logical thinking is more critical than specific toolsets.
* Excellent written communication skills in English, with a focus on clarity, tone, and instructional coherence.
* Creativity and attention to detail in crafting realistic scenarios and responses.
* Experience working with or around LLMs, virtual assistants, or function\\-calling frameworks is a plus.
* Ability to follow detailed guidelines and formatting standards with high consistency.
* 3\\+ years of overall professional experience in a technical or analytical field.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing:** 



* Work in a fully remote environment.
* Opportunity to work on cutting\\-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.



  





**Offer Details:** 



* **Commitments Required** 
 : At least 4 hours per day and minimum 20 hours per week with overlap of 4 hours with PST. (We have 3 options of time commitment: 20 hrs/week, 30 hrs/week or 40 hrs/week)
* **Engagement Type** 
 : Contractor assignment (no medical/paid leave)
* **Duration of Contract** 
 :
 **6 Weeks**

 📍 Bengaluru, India
 



  




**About REM Labs** 

  





 REM Labs is building an AI native system for autonomous software delivery inside real enterprises.
 



  





 As autonomy enters software development, the core challenge is no longer writing code faster. It is maintaining control, accountability, and institutional trust as planning, execution, and decisions become increasingly automated.
 



  





 REM is designed to operate as a complete engineering system. It maintains shared context, enforces governance, and records decisions across the software lifecycle so that autonomous work remains explainable, auditable, and safe by default.
 



  





 We are early, deliberate, and focused on building something foundational.
 



  




**The Role** 

  





 This is a founding engineering role.
 



  





 As a Staff Software Engineer at REM Labs, you will help design and build the core platform that orchestrates autonomous software delivery. This role sits at the heart of the system and owns how work is coordinated, executed, and recovered across long running workflows.
 



  





 You will work closely with the founder to shape the architecture, define system boundaries, and make foundational design decisions that will persist for years.
 



  





 This is not a DevOps role and not an application feature role. It is a systems engineering role.
 



  




**What You Will Work On** 

  




* Designing and building the core control plane for autonomous workflows
* Architecting distributed systems that manage state, retries, idempotency, and partial failure
* Defining boundaries between orchestration, execution, and governance layers
* Building primitives for long running, multi step workflows with strong correctness guarantees
* Reasoning deeply about failure modes, recovery, and operational safety
* Collaborating with ML and agent engineers to integrate intelligence safely into system workflows
* Making early architectural decisions around scalability, observability, and extensibility



  




**What We Are Looking For** 

  





 We are looking for engineers who think in systems, not just services.
 



  




**You likely have experience with** 

  




* Designing and owning distributed systems or platform infrastructure
* Building systems where correctness, reliability, and fault tolerance matter
* Working with asynchronous workflows, event driven architectures, or schedulers
* Making trade offs around state management, consistency, and failure handling



  




**You likely enjoy** 

  




* Whiteboarding architecture before writing code
* Asking what breaks before asking what ships
* Operating in ambiguity and shaping systems from first principles
* Taking ownership of problems that do not have clean edges yet



  




**Why This Role Is Different** 

  




* You are not joining a finished system. You are helping define it
* Your design decisions will shape the product, the team, and the architecture
* You will work directly with the founder, not through layers
* You will influence hiring, system boundaries, and technical direction early



  





 This is a role for engineers who want to build something that lasts.
 



  




**Compensation** 

  





 This role offers a combination of cash and meaningful equity, aligned with founding level ownership and long term impact.

 Turing is one of the world’s fastest\\-growing AI companies accelerating the advancement and deployment of powerful AI systems.
 



  





**Turing helps customers in two ways:** 
 Working with the world’s leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, multilinguality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and leveraging that work to build real\\-world AI systems that solve mission\\-critical priorities for companies.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 This position is within a project with one of the foundational LLM companies. The goal is to assist these foundational LLM companies in enhancing their Large Language Models.
 



  





 One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high\\-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine\\-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.
 



  





 For example, in the case of Agent Completion (AC) data generation, your task will be to simulate high\\-quality multi\\-turn conversations between a user and a smart assistant that utilizes function\\-calling tools to accomplish user goals. You will craft these dialogues by playing both the assistant and the user, while simulating tool use where necessary to guide the assistant through complex decision\\-making and real\\-world reasoning scenarios.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day look like:** 



* Design multi\\-turn conversations that simulate real interactions between users and AI assistants using apps like calendar, email, maps, and drive.
* Emulate both the
 **user** 
 and the
 **assistant** 
 , including the assistant's tool calls (only when corrections are needed).
* Carefully select when and how the assistant uses available tools, ensuring logical flow and proper usage of function calls.
* Craft dialogues that demonstrate natural language, intelligent behavior, and contextual understanding across multiple turns.
* Generate examples that showcase the assistant’s ability to gracefully complete feasible tasks, recognize infeasible ones, and maintain engaging general chat when tools aren’t required.
* Ensure all conversations adhere to defined formatting and quality guidelines, using an internal playbook.
* Iterate on conversation examples based on feedback to continuously improve realism, clarity, and value for training purposes.
* Collaborate with peers and reviewers to maintain consistency and high standards in deliverables.



  





**Requirements:** 



* Strong general
 **technical reasoning skills** 
 and the ability to model real\\-world assistant behavior using tool\\-based APIs.
* Ability to break down complex tasks and simulate realistic dialogues that reflect user expectations and assistant limitations.
* Experience in
 **any programming language or tech stack** 
 is acceptable; a strong grasp of APIs, data formats (e.g., JSON), and logical thinking is more critical than specific toolsets.
* Excellent written communication skills in English, with a focus on clarity, tone, and instructional coherence.
* Creativity and attention to detail in crafting realistic scenarios and responses.
* Experience working with or around LLMs, virtual assistants, or function\\-calling frameworks is a plus.
* Ability to follow detailed guidelines and formatting standards with high consistency.
* 3\\+ years of overall professional experience in a technical or analytical field.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing:** 



* Work in a fully remote environment.
* Opportunity to work on cutting\\-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.



  





**Offer Details:** 



* **Commitments Required** 
 : At least 4 hours per day and minimum 20 hours per week with overlap of 4 hours with PST. (We have 3 options of time commitment: 20 hrs/week, 30 hrs/week or 40 hrs/week)
* **Engagement Type** 
 : Contractor assignment (no medical/paid leave)
* **Duration of Contract** 
 :
 **6 Weeks**
