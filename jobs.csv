 Born in 2014, Yoti is a digital identity and biometric technology company that makes it safer for people to prove who they are. The Yoti app was designed with privacy at its core, giving people a secure way to prove their identity and share third\\-party credentials with organisations and other people.
   

  

 Today, we have over seventeen million app downloads around the world. We’ve expanded our offering to a suite of business solutions that span identity verification, age verification and estimation, e\\-signing, AI anti\\-spoofing technologies and we continue to think of innovative new offerings.
