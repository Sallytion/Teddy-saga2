* Reverse engineer malicious files using disassembly and debugging to analyze payloads, execution flow, persistence mechanisms, command\\-and\\-control behavior, and evasion techniques.
* Design, author, and maintain high\\-fidelity detection logic, including YARA rules and custom signatures, for known malware families and emerging threats.
* Lead malware scan result validation and triage, accurately distinguishing true positives from false positives and driving root cause analysis.
* Define remediation strategies, detection improvements, and rule tuning to continuously improve signal quality.

* Evaluate and integrate third\\-party malware scanning technologies where appropriate, balancing coverage, performance, and false\\-positive impact.
* Partner with CI/CD and platform teams to ensure malware scanning is cleanly embedded into build and signing workflows.


**Code Signing \\& Supply Chain Security**
* Maintain strong working knowledge of code signing systems, including certificates, trust chains, timestamping, signing policies, and root\\-of\\-trust concepts.
* Analyze signed artifacts and signing metadata to detect anomalies in certificates, issuers, signing patterns, and revocation status.
* Identify and assess risks related to signed malware, certificate misuse, anomalous signing activity, and potential key compromise.
* Understand the end\\-to\\-end artifact lifecycle (build → sign → distribute) and identify where supply chain threats can be introduced.
* Contribute to strengthening controls and monitoring across the software supply chain to defend against build system compromise, poisoned dependencies, and signed malware campaigns.


**Leadership Responsibilities**
* Act as a domain expert for malware and artifact security, advising engineering and release teams on risk and remediation.
* Lead investigations into malware and supply chain security findings, driving resolution without unnecessary delivery disruption.
* Clearly communicate technical findings and risk assessments to both technical teams and security leadership.


**Required Skills \\& Experience**
**Core Malware Expertise ( Specialist)**
* 4\\-6 years extensive hands\\-on experience in static and dynamic malware analysis.
* Strong reverse engineering expertise using tools such as IDA Pro, Ghidra, x64dbg, Radare2, or Binary Ninja.
* Deep understanding of malware techniques including persistence, obfuscation, evasion, loaders, droppers, and C2 communication.
* Proven experience authoring and maintaining YARA rules and custom detection signatures at scale.
* Demonstrated ability to validate malware scan results, manage false positives, and perform deep root cause analysis.
* Experience operating or owning malware scanning solutions in production environments.


**Supply Chain Security**
* Strong supply chain security attitude with understanding of modern software supply chain attacks.
* Experience reasoning about threats across CI/CD pipelines, build systems, dependencies, and artifact distribution.
* Familiarity with artifact integrity, provenance, and secure release practices.


**Cloud, Automation \\& Programming**
* Strong automation skills using scripts (Python, Bash, or similar) to improve security workflows.
* Familiarity with at least one programming language; Java preferred.
* Experience working in AWS environments, with hands\\-on exposure to EC2 and EKS and K8s is a bonus


**Soft Skills**
* Ability to work with multiple teams and communicate technical findings clearly to both technical and non\\-technical audiences
* Strong problem\\-solving skills and ability to work independently


**Nice to Have**
* Experience with malware scanning engines (VirusTotal, YARA\\-X, custom detection pipelines)
* Experience handling incidents involving signed malware or compromised certificates
* Background in product security, red teaming, or threat research
* Experience with sandbox evasion techniques and anti\\-analysis methods

**About Zendesk**
 At Zendesk, our mission is simple yet powerful: to make customer experiences effortless. Every day, our products help thousands of businesses worldwide build deeper relationships with their customers through fast, reliable, and beautifully simple support experiences.
   

  

 We’re taking that mission further with Action Builder – Zendesk’s next\\-generation iPaaS solution. Action Builder empowers teams to connect apps, data, and AI\\-powered agents into seamless workflows that drive automation at scale.
   

  

 At the heart of Action Builder is our Connector SDK, built to make developing integrations faster, more reliable, and more scalable. To power this vision, we’ve set up a dedicated engineering group, the Connector Lab, focused on defining connector bundles and rapidly delivering high\\-quality connectors across a wide range of third\\-party systems.

 Who you could be working with
   

  

 We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join the Connector Lab team in Pune. In this role, you’ll go beyond writing code — you’ll help define reusable patterns, guide the team on best practices, and ensure connectors are built for long\\-term scale, security, and maintainability.
   

  

 You’ll collaborate closely with our SDK, platform, and product teams to build a system that enables rapid, reliable connector delivery at scale. You’ll work with cutting\\-edge AI technologies to streamline and accelerate how we build and maintain connectors \\- making the process more efficient, intelligent, and scalable. This is a hands\\-on engineering role with opportunities to mentor, shape architecture, and influence strategy.

* Design, build, and maintain third\\-party connectors using our Connector SDK.
* Define connector bundles, templates, and patterns to accelerate connector delivery.
* Lead technical design discussions and set best practices for connector architecture.
* Collaborate with SDK and platform teams to improve developer tooling, documentation, and workflows.
* Brainstorm and creatively apply AI technologies to make connector creation faster, smarter, and more reliable.
* Ensure integrations are scalable, secure, observable, and performant.
* Partner with Product to identify and prioritize the most impactful connectors for customers.
* Contribute to and enforce standards around testing, CI/CD, error handling, and observability.
* Mentor junior engineers and raise the technical bar across the team.


**What You Bring To The Role**
* 7\\+ years of software development experience, ideally with a focus on integrations or API\\-driven systems.
* Strong JavaScript/TypeScript skills, with hands\\-on experience using SDKs and common libraries to build production\\-grade software.
* Familiarity with RESTful APIs, GraphQL, OAuth, and webhooks.
* Hands\\-on experience working with third\\-party APIs, solving common integration challenges (auth flows, rate limits, retries, schema drift).
* Strong systems design and architectural skills for scalable, reusable solutions.
* A strong product mindset – you build for reliability, maintainability, and customer impact.
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with experience mentoring or leading peers.


 Bonus points
   

  

* Experience contributing feedback to SDK or platform teams to improve developer tooling.
* Background in iPaaS, automation tools, or connector\\-heavy platforms.
* Contributions to open\\-source integration libraries or APIs.


**Why You’ll Love Zendesk**
* Work on high\\-impact projects at the core of Zendesk’s automation strategy.
* Define patterns that will scale across hundreds of connectors.
* Be part of a mission\\-driven company with a global footprint and inclusive engineering culture.
* Flexible hybrid work from our Pune hub.
* Competitive compensation, benefits, and generous leave policies.


 Tech Stack
   

  

* Our code is written primarily in JavaScript / TypeScript.
* Our frontends use frameworks including React, Redux, React Testing Library, Cypress, Jest.
* Our servers live in AWS.
* Our applications/services are deployed via Spinnaker to Kubernetes.
* Our data is stored in Aurora/MySQL, DynamoDB, and S3\\.
