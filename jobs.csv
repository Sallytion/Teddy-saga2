* Own the iOS architecture: performance, reliability, permissions, background execution, power usage, and security.
* Move fast: prototype, test, break, refine, ship.



  





**What We’re Looking For** 



* **Strong iOS fundamentals** 

 ; Swift, SwiftUI/UIKit, async/await, system frameworks.
* You’ve
 
**built and shipped iOS apps from scratch** 

 (zero\\-to\\-one), ideally more than one.
* Deep experience with:

* **Real\\-time audio (AVAudioEngine, Core Audio)**
* **Background execution modes \\& audio session management**
* **High\\-performance networking \\& streaming**
* 
* Strong sense of
 
**product quality** 

 ; animations, interactions, UI polish, user experience.
* Comfort working close to the system: performance tuning, memory profiling, concurrency, error handling.
* You work independently, make trade\\-offs quickly, and execute without waiting for perfect specs.



  





**Nice to Have** 



* Experience with
 
**voice interfaces** 

 , or ambient computing.
* Strong taste in product, UI, and consumer experience.
* Experience integrating lower\\-level C/C\\+\\+ libraries into Swift.
* Experience working in a
 
**hardware \\+ software** 

 product environment.



  





**Why Audria**
