You’re looking for a mission. A problem worth solving. A product worth building. A role where you can create something from the ground up and know it wouldn’t exist without you.
 



  





 That’s exactly what this is.
 



  





 We’ve built the early version of a SaaS platform that’s already being used by paying customers. It's called Evallo—and it’s built for private tutoring and coaching businesses, with a vision to scale across every service provider who charges by the hour. Think education, coaching, consulting, therapy, fitness—the long tail of service businesses no one is building infrastructure for.
 



  





 Now, we’re looking for someone who can take ownership of the entire tech stack and scale it with the same obsession that we’ve brought to the business and product design. This isn’t a cushy CTO title with a team of engineers waiting for you. It’s you, your code, your vision, and the real\\-world results we ship together. You will be the reason this product becomes robust, scalable, and beautiful.
 



  





 As the go\\-to technical person from Day 1, you will:
 


* Architect \\& scale a full\\-stack product (MERN stack—MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
* Ship clean, reliable code fast—this isn’t R\\&D, it’s a build\\-and\\-deploy environment
* Turn raw ideas into working features—from Figma wireframes to production
* Handle integrations (Google, Zoom, Stripe, etc.) \\& build APIs that support our workflows
* Think about data structures, performance, security, and reliability like it’s your own product (because it is)



  





 This is a hands\\-on builder role. It’s not about managing a team—it’s about being the engineer who makes the product real.
 



  





**Location** 
 : Remote
 



**Experience** 
 : 5\\+ Years
 



**Industry** 
 : SaaS, EdTech, Service Ops Automation
 



**Stake** 
 : 10\\-15% equity shares (valued between 2\\.8 to 4\\.2 Crores)
 



  





 You’ve probably been a Founder, CTO, or Founding Engineer before. Maybe you’ve exited. Maybe it fizzled. Either way, you know the startup life, and you’re still in love with it.
 



  





 You should be someone who
 


* Has built and shipped real products (bonus if they were SaaS)
* Understands how to build fast and build right
* Knows tradeoffs and how to make smart bets with limited resources
* Can collaborate with a non\\-technical founder without friction
* Doesn’t need a roadmap to take initiative—you ARE the roadmap



  





**How to Appl** 
 y
 



 Email your cover letter to hr@evallo.ai with:
 



 📌 A short video on what you’ve built before (projects or startups—links preferred)
 



 📌 Why this kind of early\\-stage, high\\-responsibility role excites you
 



 📌 Your GitHub/portfolio/resume (whichever you prefer)
 



  





 No formalities. Keep it direct, conversational, and honest. Talk to me like you would to a fellow founder at a coffee shop.
