***About the Company***




  





 Digiaccel Learning is a Gurgaon headquartered education company that is redefining the gold standard of management education for the digital and AI first world. By doing so, it is building the next generation of business leaders in the country. The mission of the company is to build employability through education.
 



  





 Education is a hard and important problem to solve for. India needs to double it’s higher education infrastructure in order to serve it’s large demographic of youth. Within what exists, quality is a large problem with studies reporting that 50% of Indian graduates are unemployable. Add to this the shift in the skills ecosystem at the workplace with AI and digitization. All of this has led to a higher education infrastructure that is unable to serve the aspirations of it’s students. So you have MBA students from solid institutes who are unplaced and professionals who are struggling to level up in their careers because they don’t have the skills to progress.
 



  





 The secret sauce at the company is it’s instructional design, a learner centric ethos and a bar for quality that runs across touchpoints. This reflects in a 80%\\+ NPS across all programs since inception.
 



  





 Digiaccel Learning is VC backed and has CXOs and Founders of some of India’s top digital commerce companies as it’s investors.
