 MixRank processes petabytes of data every month from web crawling. We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Security.
   

  

 Team is 56\\+ full\\-time, full\\-remote from 20\\+ countries. We're growing, profitable, employee\\-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.
   

  

 We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.
   

  

 Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully\\-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git. We care more about the candidate as a person than the specific technology experience.
   

  

 We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full\\-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.
   

  

**Who We’re Looking For**
 We're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more. We'll cater the role to whatever subset of these areas match your interests.
   

  

 Beneficial experience includes PostgreSQL, Python, Rust, Linux, TypeScript, Nix, frontend/backend web development, and data mining.
   

  

 Please include your updated resume when applying for this role.","Market Research","https://www.linkedin.com/company/mixrank","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQE0qoCtL5YReQ/company-logo_100_100/B56ZTusTRMGsAQ-/0/1739171378879/mixrank_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=KYIbAZ1lOqAj0TFK8dhT99KaeIgG6gkyZrUbFthVabg","","","","","","","","","","",""
