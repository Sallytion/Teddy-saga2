 Join us in a rare ground\\-floor opportunity to build and scale a transformative team within Amazon's IES DEX organization, where we're evolving from a successful proof of concept to an enterprise\\-scale operation in the Cart Building and Package Consolidation space.
   

  

 Our team stands out for its unique full\\-stack ownership model, where QAEs support work across both customer\\-facing products and core infrastructure. You'll be assuring quality of products that are customer touchpoints throughout the entire shopping journey \\- from smart notification systems and interactive product detail widgets to sophisticated checkout flows and post\\-purchase experiences. On the infrastructure side, you'll be supporting the backbone that powers these experiences: high\\-throughput APIs, complex ML model integrations, and large\\-scale customer behavior datasets that drive decision\\-making across Amazon.
   

  

 What makes this role particularly exciting is the multi\\-dimensional nature of our technical challenges. You'll work on latest technologies for real\\-time incentive vending and clawback mechanisms, test sophisticated abuse prevention algorithms, and enable scaling of precise customer targeting solutions. Our team has evolved beyond building just for ourselves \\- we've developed robust platforms and APIs that are now critical infrastructure for multiple teams across Amazon, dealing with massive scale and unique technical challenges. This combination of product innovation, infrastructure development, and platform ownership creates an unprecedented learning opportunity for engineers who want to grow across multiple technical domains.
   

  

 Quality Assurance Engineers at Amazon test applications and products at the user level and code level, both manually and with automated tools. Our QAEs are not pure black box testers, they are able to understand software internals, debug problems using log files, and write automated tests with Scripting tools and/or user\\-level automated tools. QAEs at Amazon are excellent individual contributors capable of taking up tasks from start to completion with minimal help. QAEs would be responsible for understanding the domain and the product in detail and coming up with the test strategy/planning, coming up with the test cases, driving the test case sign\\-off processes with the stakeholders, contributing to code level unit tests, test execution and reporting.
   

  

 Upon joining IES DEX, every employee is paired with a peer buddy who will help you to quickly come up to speed in understanding the technology we’re building, the tools we use and the business problems we’re trying to solve. We hire exceptional people and we recognize the importance of coaching others. We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, and job level. On our internal “Broadcast” video streaming website, you’ll find countless presentations by some of the brightest minds in computing discussing solutions to many of the exciting problems we’re solving in Amazon today with new live\\-streaming videos added every week.
   

  

 Work/Life Balance
   

  

 Our team puts a high value on work\\-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We recognize that the circumstances of our team members vary, and we balance work across the team so that we’re all able to maintain high standards on behalf of our customers, while at the same time allowing for rich and happy personal lives. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life\\-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.
   

  

 Mentorship \\& Career Growth
   

  

 Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one\\-on\\-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better\\-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.
