 To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.
 



 Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.
 



 While many roles at Coinbase are remote\\-first, we are not remote\\-only. In\\-person participation is required throughout the year.

**What you’ll be doing (i.e., job duties):** 



* Build high\\-performance services using Golang and gRPC, creating seamless integrations that elevate Coinbase's customer experience.
* Adopt, learn, and drive best practices in design techniques, coding, testing, documentation, monitoring, and alerting.
* Demonstrate a keen awareness of Coinbase’s platform, development practices, and various technical domains, and build upon them to efficiently deliver improvements across multiple teams.
* Add positive energy in every meeting and make your coworkers feel included in every interaction.
* Communicate across the company to both technical and non\\-technical leaders with ease.
* Deliver top\\-quality services in a tight timeframe by navigating seamlessly through uncertainties.
* Work with teams and teammates across multiple time zones.



**What we look for in you (i.e., job requirements):** 



* 3\\+ years of experience as a software engineer and 1\\+ years building backend services using Golang and gRPC.
* A self\\-starter capable of executing complex solutions with minimal guidance while ensuring efficiency and scalability.
* Proven experience integrating at least two third\\-party applications using Golang.
* Hands\\-on experience with AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Buildkite, or similar cloud infrastructure tools.
* Working knowledge of event\\-driven architectures (Kafka, MQ, etc.) and hands\\-on experience with SQL or NoSQL databases.
* Good understanding of gRPC, GraphQL, ETL pipelines, and modern development practices.



**Nice to haves:** 



* SaaS platform experience (Salesforce, Amazon Connect, Sprinklr).
* Experience with AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, or similar tools.
* Familiarity with rate limiters, caching, metrics, logging, and debugging.
