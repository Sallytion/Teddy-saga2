 This is a hands\\-on senior engineering role with deep ownership of frontend architecture, interactive UI development, and
 **explicit responsibility for frontend and end\\-to\\-end test coverage** 
 . You will work primarily in
 **React and TypeScript** 
 , contribute to a shared design system, and build advanced diagrammatic and SVG\\-based interfaces.
   

  

 This is not a “UI\\-only” position. We are looking for an engineer with strong judgment, systems thinking, and a commitment to frontend quality, correctness, and long\\-term maintainability.

* Ensure frontend codebases remain scalable, maintainable, and well\\-structured as the platform grows.


**Interactive \\& Visual UI Engineering**
* Build highly interactive, visual interfaces using diagramming and graph libraries such as ReactFlow, JointJS, D3, or similar.
* Work directly with SVG primitives to implement custom visuals, connectors, and interactions.
* Implement performant pan/zoom, drag\\-and\\-drop, selection, and layout behaviors.
* Make informed trade\\-offs between leveraging third\\-party libraries and implementing custom rendering logic.


**Testing, Quality \\& Reliability (Core Responsibility)**
* Write and maintain unit, integration, and end\\-to\\-end tests for frontend features.
* Own UI test strategy and coverage for assigned product areas and critical user flows.
* Use modern testing frameworks such as React Testing Library, Playwright, and/or Cypress.
* Ensure tests are reliable, maintainable, and integrated into CI pipelines.
