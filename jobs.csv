**Building the Future of Cross\\-Border Movement** 




 OpenSphere is reimagining global mobility through technology. We help ambitious founders, researchers, and professionals bring their ideas across borders by transforming complex U.S. immigration into simple, intelligent workflows.
 



 We're not a law firm. We're builders turning legal complexity into digital clarity.
 



  





**The Role** 




 This isn't about watching from the sidelines. You'll build the actual product—features that clients use daily to organize evidence, track cases, and move faster through immigration. Every function you write serves someone building their future.
 



  





**What You'll Do** 




  




* Ship features that make the platform faster, smoother, and more reliable
* Build AI\\-driven tools that eliminate repetitive work and accelerate case prep
* Design interfaces that feel intuitive, even when the underlying process is complex
* Debug, test, and optimize where performance and reliability matter most
* Document and share insights—we value learning as much as shipping



  





  





  





**You Might Be a Fit If You** 




  




* Study (or recently graduated in) Computer Science or Engineering
* Have strong fundamentals in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, or Node.js
* Work comfortably with React, Next.js, or similar frameworks
* Are eager to learn, build, and see your code in production
* Get curious about where technology meets real\\-world impact



  





  





  





**What Sets You Apart** 



* Velocity with Precision – Ship fast without breaking trust
* Builder's Instinct – Think in solutions, not obstacles
* Collaborative Spirit – Strong communication, even stronger teamwork
* Comfortable with Flux – Thrive amid shifting priorities and quick pivots
* Relentless Curiosity – Always asking ""what if we tried this differently?""



  





  





**What Makes This Different** 




  




* Real\\-world problems with global impact—not toy projects or contrived exercises
* Hands\\-on AI development in a production SaaS environment from week one
* Culture of experimentation—test ideas, iterate quickly, learn continuously
* Global reach—your code serves users around the world, not just a GitHub repo



  





  





  





**How We Work** 



* Hybrid \\& Flexible – Balance remote focus time with collaborative in\\-office sessions
* Modern Stack – GitHub, Slack, Notion, AI copilots
* Output\\-Driven – Measured by impact and results, not hours or attendance
* High Trust – Autonomy to make decisions, responsibility to own outcomes



  





  





**What You'll Gain** 




  




* Shipped features that prove impact, not just participation
* Dual mentorship in both engineering craft and product thinking
* Portfolio evidence of solving meaningful problems at scale
* Certificate \\+ Letter of Recommendation

 The Mindrift platform, launched and powered by Toloka, connects domain experts with cutting\\-edge AI projects from innovative tech clients. Our mission is to unlock the potential of GenAI by tapping into real\\-world expertise from across the globe.
   

  

 We're on the hunt for hands\\-on Python engineers for a new project focused on developing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and internal tools for running and evaluating agent behavior. You'll implement base methods for agent action verification, integrate with internal and client infrastructures, and help fill tooling gaps across the team.
   

  

**Who we're looking for:**
 Calling all security researchers, engineers, and penetration testers with a strong foundation in problem\\-solving, offensive security, and AI\\-related risk assessment.
   

  

 We're looking for someone who can bring a hands\\-on approach to technical challenges, whether breaking into systems to expose weaknesses or building secure tools and processes. We value contributors with a passion for continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptability.
   

  

 What you'll be doing:
   

  

* Developing and maintaining MCP\\-compatible evaluation servers
* Implementing logic to check agent actions against scenario definitions
* Creating or extending tools that writers and QAs use to test agents
* Working closely with infrastructure engineers to ensure compatibility
