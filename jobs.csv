* Ensure business continuity through backup, disaster recovery, and multi\\-region deployments.


 Automation \\& Reliability
   

  

* Develop and maintain Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates with Terraform, or Cloud Deployment Manager.
* Adopt GitOps practices (Flux) for infrastructure lifecycle management.
* Build and optimize CI/CD pipelines for data pipelines, model workflows, and GenAI applications.
* Apply SRE principles (SLIs, SLOs, SLAs) to guarantee platform reliability and uptime.


 Security, Governance \\& Compliance
   

  

* Embed DevSecOps best practices across the infrastructure lifecycle, including policy\\-as\\-code, vulnerability scanning, and secrets management.
* Enforce identity and access management (IAM), network segmentation, and data encryption in compliance with standards (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, FedRAMP).
* Collaborate with enterprise security and compliance teams to implement governance frameworks for GenAI platforms.


 Monitoring, Observability \\& Cost Optimization
   

  

* Implement observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, Cloud Monitoring, Datadog) for both infra health and ML\\-specific metrics (model drift, data anomalies).
* Define KPIs to monitor system health, performance, and adoption across AI workloads.
* Optimize cloud cost efficiency for GPU/TPU\\-intensive workloads using autoscaling, preemptible instances, and utilization monitoring.


 Collaboration \\& Enablement
   

  

* Partner with data scientists, ML engineers, and software teams to streamline GenAI application development and deployment.
* Provide onboarding, documentation, and reusable templates to enable faster adoption of AI infrastructure.
* Stay current with the latest advancements in GenAI, cloud\\-native infrastructure, and container orchestration.


 Required Education
   

  

 Bachelor’s or master’s degree in computer science, Software Engineering, or a related field.
   

  

**Required Experience**
* 5\\+ years of experience in cloud infrastructure engineering, DevOps, or platform engineering.

* Familiarity with data pipelines and integration tools (Dataflow, Apache Beam, Pub/Sub, Kafka).
* Excellent problem\\-solving, debugging, and communication skills.


**Preferred Experience**
* Experience in MLOps practices for model deployment, monitoring, and retraining.
* Exposure to multi\\-cloud or hybrid cloud environments (GCP, AWS, Azure, on\\-prem).
* Hands\\-on experience with feature stores (Vertex AI Feature Store, Feast) and ML observability tools (EvidentlyAI, Fiddler).
* Knowledge of distributed training frameworks (Horovod, DeepSpeed, PyTorch Distributed).
* Contributions to open\\-source projects in infrastructure, MLOps, or GenAI.
* Experience managing infrastructure in regulated industries.


**Preferred Certifications**
* Google Cloud Certified \\- Professional Cloud Architect
* Google Cloud Certified \\- Machine Learning Engineer
* Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) or Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)
* IBM Certified Watsonx Generative AI Engineer – Associate
