Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end\\-to\\-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross\\-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross\\-border trade.

Backlogs expand without limit, cycle times stretch across weeks, and code review frequently becomes a formality designed to satisfy sprint deadlines. Integration risk, fragile system architectures, and ambiguous requirements plague most development teams. AI coding agents now produce functional code, but only when guided by explicit specifications and monitored with discipline. The industry continues adding developers to projects rather than repairing the underlying process that converts ideas into dependable, production\\-ready software.
   

  

 Trilogy has chosen a different approach. We operate an agentic development model from start to finish: engineers lead research, specification design, architectural decisions, and quality oversight, while AI agents execute implementation. Specifications are crafted for execution by Claude Code, following test\\-first principles and carefully constrained scope to limit risk exposure. This approach enables continuous delivery of production features with substantially faster feedback cycles, reduced integration surprises, and greater confidence in correctness before code reaches the main branch.
   

  

 This role is for engineers who prefer designing systems and validating correctness over processing task queues. Your time will divide roughly as follows: 10–20% conducting research and technical discovery to map existing behavior, constraints, and stakeholder requirements; 40–50% transforming that knowledge into precise, test\\-driven, agent\\-compatible specifications and architectural plans; and 40–50% directing and supervising implementation execution. You own what ships: no silent failures, no vague specifications, no deflecting accountability to the agent.
   

  

 You'll work with a team that treats specification as engineering output, review as a technical discipline, and delivery as the metric that matters. If you find energy in elegant system architecture, precise scoping, and rigorous validation—and you already integrate tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or ChatGPT into your daily practice—this environment will suit you. Bring your architectural expertise, your test\\-driven development discipline, and your uncompromising standards for code quality. If this describes you, join us and shape the next generation of software delivery. Apply and demonstrate how you direct agents to produce production\\-grade results at scale.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Discovery: Examining existing systems, stakeholder requirements, and data sources to map the problem domain and identify technical constraints
* Technical Specification: Translating research insights and stakeholder needs into precise, executable technical specifications tailored for agentic coding assistants (primarily Claude Code) following spec\\-driven development practices
* AI Implementation: Directing AI coding agents through implementation, performing continuous review and validation of agent\\-generated code, and merging verified changes into the production codebase


**AI Software Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Continuous delivery of production\\-quality software features and systems through agentic development workflows, in which AI coding agents execute implementation while engineers control specification, architecture, and quality assurance


**Basic Requirements**
* Minimum 3 years professional software engineering experience in production environments
* Experience participating in pull request review processes
* Experience using AI coding tools (e.g. Claude Code, Windsurf, Cursor) in a professional setting
