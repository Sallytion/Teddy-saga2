* You're the kind of engineer who gets frustrated when developers waste time on things that should be automated and then builds the thing that fixes it. You:
* Have 4\\+ experience building developer tooling and internal platforms \\- you've created self\\-service systems, CLI tools, SDKs, or internal APIs, and iterating on them based off feedback and real\\-world usage to measurably improve developer productivity
* Think AI\\-first when designing solutions \\- you think automation in terms of agents and workflows. Naturally reaching for LLMs, AI code generation, and intelligent automation as building blocks, not novelties.
* Use AI tools daily to accelerate your work – whether it be forcoding, debugging, reviews or documentation, you’re well versed in leveraging AI to 10x your impact
* Have strong end\\-to\\-end knowledge of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) \\- from discovery, planning, defining, coding, testing, deployment and operations. You understand how each phase connects and where friction hides, and you've used that understanding where to automate, streamline, and improve the entire flow, not just one piece of it
* Are passionate about CI/CD and release automation \\- you've built or significantly improved build systems, designed deployment pipelines that give engineers confidence to ship continuously and understand dependency management
* Measure your success in developer productivity, not lines of code \\- you care about DORA metrics, onboarding time to first commit, cycle time, and automation effectiveness. You've used frameworks like DORA, Core 4 or SPACE to drive measurable improvements
* Understand the value of great documentation and onboarding \\- you've built or championed AI\\-automated documentation, self\\-updating runbooks, or knowledge\\-sharing systems that actually get used
* Are comfortable working in a regulated environment \\- you understand that ""move fast"" in financial services means moving fast safely, with appropriate guardrails, audit trails, and compliance awareness
* Embrace DevOps culture: You build it, you run it \\- you take end\\-to\\-end ownership and you're not waiting for someone else to deploy, monitor, or fix what you've built
* Operate with strong opinions, held loosely \\- you bring a clear point of view on how developer experience should work but you listen, learn and adapt when the evidence says otherwise
* Communicate clearly across distributed teams \\- you work effectively with colleagues across multiple timezones, write excellent and clear documentation, and default to transparency
* It would be an added bonus if you:
* Have worked at a fintech, bank or other regulated business
* Have experience building or customising developer portals (e.g., Backstage or similar service catalogues)
* Have integrated tools like GitHub Copilot, LLM APIs, or AI\\-powered code review into real engineering workflows
* Have experience with AI\\-powered risk detection, intelligent test generation or AI\\-assisted code review at scale
