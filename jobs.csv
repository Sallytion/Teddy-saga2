 Company: OpenSphere
 



 Location: Delhi (Hybrid – mix of remote and in\\-office)
 



 Duration: 2–3 months (high performers may be offered full\\-time)
 



 Stipend: Competitive, output\\-driven
 



 Start Date: Immediate / Rolling
 



  





**About OpenSphere** 




 We're building AI\\-powered tools that make U.S. immigration navigable. OpenSphere helps founders, researchers, and professionals understand and pursue O\\-1, EB\\-1A, and EB\\-2 NIW visas turning months of confusion into clear, actionable pathways.
 



 Our platform sits at the intersection of law, AI, and product design. We're small, we move fast, and every feature matters.
 



  





**The Role** 




 You'll work as a Software Engineering Intern building features that go into production. This isn't about observing or doing mock projects you'll write code that attorneys and applicants use daily.
 



 Expect real ownership, direct feedback, and the chance to shape how people experience immigration tech.
 



  





**What You'll Build** 




**User\\-facing features:** 




 Dashboards that track application progress. Document upload and processing systems. Eligibility assessment tools that guide users through complex criteria.
 



**AI\\-powered workflows** 




 Integrate LLMs to analyze case evidence, generate petition drafts, and surface relevant precedents. Test what works, iterate on what doesn't.
 



**Backend infrastructure** 




 Build APIs that connect our platform to external services. Design data models for immigration cases. Implement automation that reduces manual legal work.
 



**End\\-to\\-end ownership** 




 Take a feature from concept to deployment. Make technical decisions. Learn from code reviews. Ship with confidence.
 



  





**You Might Be a Fit If You** 



* You're pursuing a degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field
* You know JavaScript/TypeScript or Python well enough to build something functional
* You've worked with (or are eager to learn) React, Next.js, or Node.js
* You've built something: a class project, hackathon submission, side app, or open\\-source contribution
* You can read documentation, debug independently, and ask good questions when stuck
* You're genuinely curious about how AI can solve domain\\-specific problems



  





**What Sets You Apart** 



* Experience with AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) or prompt engineering
* Understanding of databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) or data modelling
* Exposure to document processing or working with unstructured data
* Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, Vercel) or CI/CD workflows
* Previous work in regulated domains (legal, healthcare, finance) or compliance\\-heavy products
* Contributions to open source or technical writing that show clear thinking
* (These aren't requirements, so they're signals that you'll ramp up faster.)



  





**Why This Role Is Different** 




 Most internships give you low\\-priority tasks or endless tutorials. Here, you ship real features in week one.
 



 You'll work directly with senior engineers, not through layers of hierarchy. You'll sit in product discussions with designers and immigration attorneys. You'll see how legal expertise translates into technical requirements.
 



 You're building for high\\-stakes decisions; people's careers and futures depend on what we ship. That means higher standards, but also more meaningful work.
 



 Strong performers don't just get certificates; they get full\\-time offers with equity.
 



  





**How We Work** 



* Hybrid \\& Flexible – Balance remote focus time with collaborative in\\-office sessions
* Modern Stack – GitHub, Slack, Notion, AI copilots
* Output\\-Driven – Measured by impact and results, not hours or attendance
* High Trust – Autonomy to make decisions, responsibility to own outcomes



  





**What You'll Gain** 



* Technical growth: Production experience with modern web frameworks and AI integrations
* Legaltech expertise: Understanding of a specialized, high\\-growth sector
* Product thinking: Learn how technical decisions affect user outcomes
* Mentorship: Regular pairing sessions and code reviews with senior engineers
* Real portfolio work: Projects you can showcase and discuss in future interviews
* Path forward: Certificate, LOR, and priority consideration for full\\-time roles
* If you perform well, we'll make a full\\-time offer before your internship ends","Human Resources Services","https://www.linkedin.com/company/opensphereai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFvCaRAcdAZQg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1727286234085/opensphereai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=LvA9uUqSCK6ic3aMQtpYvuBl9aG6vBETUNUkBJQq7ws","","","","","","","","","","",""
