 We’re building a team to deliver foundational Customer Data Platform (CDP) use cases in 45 days. Our promise: from
 
*not out\\-of\\-the\\-box* 

 to
 
*out\\-of\\-the\\-box* 

 with Segment, in record time.
 





 We need an Integration Engineer who doesn’t just code — you
 
**wire the ecosystem together** 

 . From event instrumentation to destination setup, you’ll make Segment come alive in the client’s stack. If you love turning complexity into working data flows, this is for you.
 








**What You’ll Do** 



* Implement event tracking plans across web, mobile, and server.
* Connect sources and destinations (analytics, marketing, warehouse).
* Debug data flows using Segment debugger, Protocol, and destination logs.
* Maintain schema consistency and enforce identity stitching (userId vs anonymousId).
* QA everything — validate in staging, push to production, demo value to the client.
* Create handover docs and runbooks so anyone can pick up where you left off.
* Support multiple client projects at once — calm under pressure, clear under chaos.



  





**Key Responsibilities** 



* Set up and configure Segment workspaces.
* Instrument ≥95% of planned events with ≤5% schema violations.
* Validate end\\-to\\-end data flow: Source → Segment → Destination.
* Connect at least one analytics destination (e.g., GA4/Amplitude).
* Connect at least one marketing destination (e.g., Mailchimp/ESP).
* Document schema, traits, and identity model in detail.
* Collaborate with Engagement Lead (project rhythm) and Solutions Architect (schema design).



  





**What We’re Looking For** 




**Minimum Requirements** 



* Hands\\-on experience implementing SDKs (Segment preferred, GA4/Amplitude okay).
* Comfortable debugging payloads (network tools, Postman, Segment debugger).
* Strong documentation habits — tracking plans, schema, identity flows.
* Familiar with APIs, JSON payloads, and logging tools.



**Bonus Points For** 



* Experience with CDPs (especially Segment).
* Connecting multiple destinations across analytics, marketing, and warehouse.
* Prior work on fast client implementations with strict timelines.







**The Mindset We Hire For** 



* You don’t just push code — you deliver business value.
* Schema chaos keeps you up at night.
* You thrive on clarity, documentation, and overcommunication.
* If data isn’t flowing, you’re restless until it is.
* You’re resourceful: when blocked, you don’t wait — you find another path.



  





**Tools You’ll Use** 





 Segment Workspace \\+ SDKs, Debugger, Protocol, GA4, Amplitude, Mailchimp (free tier), Postman, Chrome DevTools, Trello/Jira, Slack, Notion/Confluence.
 






**Rule:** 

 If it’s not in Segment or documented, it didn’t happen. Assumptions should be made explicit.
 








**Why Join Us?** 





 This isn’t a checklist role. It’s a builder role. You’ll be part of a team that thrives on
 
**clarity, pressure, and execution** 

 — delivering CDP implementations that look effortless to the client.
 





 If you want to obsess over schemas, debug like a pro, and show clients their data lighting up in real\\-time — you’ll thrive here. If not, you’ll burn out fast. We’re not for everyone, and that’s intentional.
 








**Self\\-Check Before You Apply** 





 Ask yourself:
 



* Can I instrument “signup\\_completed” in code and see it live in the Segment debugger?
* Can I explain anonymousId vs userId in plain English?
* Do I instinctively document new events as I ship them?
* Could I set up Segment and connect Amplitude or GA4 without Googling every step?
* If blocked, do I naturally look for workarounds instead of waiting for help?




 If the answer is yes → apply. If not → this role isn’t for you.
 








**How to Apply** 





 We don’t hire off resumes alone. We hire off how you approach, how you execute, and how you communicate under pressure.
 





 Here’s what to do:
 
**Complete our** 
 Integration Engineer Exercise.
 

 We care about clarity, rhythm, and spark — not polish.
