 📍 𝗟𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Remote (India)
 



 🕒 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: 0–1 years (React / Next.js / TypeScript / AI / ML Engineering)
 



 🧩 𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗲 (𝗙𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁\\-𝗘𝗻𝗱) \\| 𝗦𝘆𝗻𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘆𝗫
 



 Can you make messy things feel… well… a bit more ""oh, that actually makes sense now"" even when the manual doesn’t exist and nobody remembered to write the spec?
 



 At SynaptyX, we build things that actually work in the wild.
 



 Less hype, more shipping.
 



 Less ""look at our shiny slide"", more ""the user clicked it and it did the right thing"".
 



 If you care about engineering precision, human centred experiences, and figuring things out without being spoon fed, you’ll probably be unreasonably happy here.
 



 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 



 🧠 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗲
 



 This role is not about stitching pages together.
 



 It is about owning the entire frontend stack: UI architecture, motion design, UX reasoning, data flows, backend integration, and the occasional ""why is this supposedly simple thing not working"" investigation that you will… yes… figure out.
 



 You will take ownership of the full frontend experience end to end: shaping interfaces, interaction models, UX systems, data flows, and backend request patterns.
 



 If you think in components, data models, motion patterns, system behaviours and outcomes (not just outputs)... this is for you.
 



 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 



 💻 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 \\& 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲
 



 You’ll fit right in if you can:
 



 • Build production ready interfaces with React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind and Shadcn/UI
 



 • Architect modular, scalable component systems, not one off pages
 



 • Deliver clean responsive layouts without random breakpoints rebelling on a Tuesday
 



 • Lead interaction and motion design using Framer Motion
 



 • Implement interactive or 3D elements with Three.js when needed
 



 • Optimise performance with caching, render control, lazy loading
 



 • Care about accessibility and semantic HTML because users actually matter
 



 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 



 🧭 𝗨𝗫 \\& 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻
 



 • Think in user journeys, friction points and decision paths
 



 • Turn vague product requirements into usable flows and prototypes
 



 • Create interfaces that feel natural and predictable
 



 • Collaborate with product and design on IA, clarity and flow
 



 • Use motion and micro interactions deliberately, not as decoration
 



 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 



 📊 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 \\& 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲
 



 • Work confidently with real world data structures and transformations
 



 • Understand how backend data becomes user facing insight
 



 • Design UI states for loading, errors, retries, filters, insights and the unexpected
 



 • Define predictable TypeScript models for responses and mutations
 



 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 



 🔗 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 ↔ 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
 



 • Integrate cleanly with backend services using typed API contracts
 



 • Implement error handling, retries, optimistic updates and fallback states that do not explode
 



 • Own request flows, caching, invalidation and state management
 



 • Handle authentication and client side security like an adult
 



 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 



 🛠️ 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗢𝘄𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽
 



 • Collaborate with backend teams (FastAPI, Node, etc.) on request design, validation and error propagation
 



 • Reason through APIs, data structures and system performance
 



 • Think in full system flows instead of stopping at the UI boundary
 



 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 



 🤖 𝗕𝗼𝗻𝘂𝘀 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 (𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀)
 



 • Experience working with agentic AI solutions
 



 • Built or integrated LLM driven features, multi agent flows or AI decision pipelines
 



 • Ability to collaborate on AI heavy product surfaces without getting lost in buzzwords
 



 We do not expect you to be an AI researcher.
 



 But if you enjoy figuring out how AI fits into real products, that is a strong plus.
 



 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 



 📌 𝗥𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
 



 • Solid expertise in React, Next.js and TypeScript
 



 • Strong hands on experience with Tailwind and Shadcn/UI
 



 • Proficiency in Framer Motion; comfortable with Three.js fundamentals
 



 • Clear understanding of REST APIs, auth flows and frontend security
 



 • Ability to debug, optimise and reason across frontend \\+ backend
 



 • Strong grasp of UX, usability and interaction design fundamentals
 



 • Comfortable working with data, transformations and complex UI logic
 



 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 



 🚫 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝘆 𝗶𝗳:
 



 • You only assemble pages, not systems
 



 • You outsource thinking to libraries or rely on ""it just works"" magic
 



 • You prefer design theatre over actual user impact
 



 • You avoid backend discussions or data reasoning
 



 • You need hand holding when things get messy
