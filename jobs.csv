 team can provide you the opportunity to build and operate a suite of massive scale, integrated cloud services in a broadly distributed, multi\\-tenant cloud environment. OCI is committed to providing the best in cloud products that meet the needs of our customers who are tackling some of the world’s biggest challenges.
 



 Oracle’s Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) team is a new ground\\-up effort to build Infrastructure\\-as\\-a\\-Service that operates at a high scale in a broadly distributed multi\\-tenant cloud environment. Our customers run their businesses on our cloud, and our mission is to provide them with best\\-in\\-class compute, storage, networking, database, security, and an ever\\-expanding set of foundational cloud\\-based services. These are exciting times in our space \\- we are growing fast, still at a relatively early stage, and working on ambitious new initiatives.
 



  





 We are building a new Software Assurance Gateway team at OCI. Our mission is to build and operate a set of gateway services to perform comprehensive software assurance of the applications running within a tenancy. Software assurance includes measures to prevent the deployment of malware or vulnerable, malicious, or unauthorized code into the application’s tenancy. It also includes monitoring the flow of data in and out of the application’s tenancy to prevent unauthorized exfiltration of data.
 



  





 The software gateway services will intercept web traffic, operator actions, and CI/CD pipelines to perform a set of assurance functions such as vulnerability scanning, signature validation, rules checking, policy compliance and anomaly detection. These functions will generate logs, audit trails, metrics, and alerts to enable automated and manual assurance of code as well as ingress/egress traffic. The team will develop and maintain the gateway code as well as operate the gateway infrastructure for the application. The team will be responsible for the performance, scalability, and reliability of the gateways. In particular, they will be responsible for ensuring that the performance of the application, as well as the developer velocity of the application teams, are not negatively impacted by the assurance gateways. They will optimize the gateway code to ensure low overhead and they will scale the gateways to handle increases in traffic and in the frequencies of application updates.
 



  





 As Senior Software Engineer, you will work with a team of software engineers responsible for the software design, development, and operations for our new and existing products. You should be able to architect broad systems interactions, be hands\\-on, be able to dive deep into any part of the stack, and have a good sense of cloud infrastructure and networking knowledge. You should value simplicity and impact, work comfortably in a collaborative, agile environment, and be excited to learn.
 



  





 Our senior engineers are also the people who can work independently and provide technical leadership to the organization. You should have experience developing and operating high\\-scale services, and an understanding of how to make these cloud\\-scale services resilient. The ideal candidate will be technically strong and productive; someone who knows how to balance speed and quality with iterative and incremental improvements. You understand operational excellence and know\\-how to infuse a culture of being proactive within your team. You recommend and justify major changes to new and existing products and establish consensus with data\\-driven approaches.

 Operational excellence is not optional at Trilogy—it is a strategic differentiator. We acquire software companies rapidly and scale them at pace. To sustain this velocity, we require leaders who engineer lean, automated systems rather than solve problems by adding headcount.
   

  

 You will take ownership of transformations spanning our global portfolio. This may involve redesigning offboarding workflows for 1,200\\+ employees following an acquisition, replacing platforms like Jira and Salesforce with AI agents, or creating automations that remove thousands of manual hours. Your execution will be swift, powered by Python, LLM APIs, and tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, and MCP—supported by a library of battle\\-tested playbooks that keep you focused on outcomes.
   

  

 Trilogy manages a portfolio exceeding 100 products with disciplined efficiency. We operate with reduced hierarchy, accelerated cycles, and elevated standards compared to traditional enterprise settings. This is an opportunity to generate meaningful impact at scale without navigating bureaucracy or managing oversized teams.
   

  

 We do not maintain status quo operations. We do not outsource transformation work. And we do not hire individuals who require consensus or large teams to execute. We seek a limited number of technically proficient, execution\\-oriented leaders who leverage automation and prioritize speed. If this describes you, you will excel here.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Driving high\\-complexity operational initiatives including M\\&A integrations, enterprise system migrations, and large\\-scale organizational transitions
* Building and deploying automations that replace CRM and task management platforms using Python and LLM APIs
* Implementing AI\\-enabled workflows through Cursor, Windsurf, and MCP to remove manual processes and reduce cycle time
* Owning initiatives end\\-to\\-end—from diagnosis through deployment—guided by proven playbooks and executive\\-level decision\\-making
* Completing a practical technical assessment to validate your capability to architect and deliver AI\\-first solutions


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Building or managing large teams—you will rely on technology, not layers of people
* Participating in prolonged alignment meetings or waiting for consensus to proceed
* Handing off technical work to IT or external vendors—you will design and implement the solution directly
* Operating in steady\\-state mode—this role centers on transformation and speed


**AI Operations Specialist Key Responsibilities**
 Architect and deliver AI\\-first operational systems that remove manual overhead, simplify complexity, and enable scalable execution across Trilogy's worldwide software portfolio.
   

  

**Basic Requirements**
* Located in North America (excluding California), South/Central America, or Western Europe (UTC \\-8 to UTC \\+2\\)
* 5\\+ years of operational leadership within enterprise software
* 3\\+ years in customer\\-facing functions (Support, Sales, Collections, etc.)
* Proven ability to develop automation using Python and integrate with LLM APIs
* Hands\\-on experience deploying production\\-grade automations with Cursor, Windsurf, MCP, or comparable tools
* Track record of executing quickly, thinking autonomously, and delivering high\\-stakes outcomes without supervision


**Nice\\-to\\-have Requirements**
* Background leading major organizational transitions such as M\\&A integrations or large\\-scale offboarding
* Track record designing and launching AI\\-driven operational systems
* Portfolio showcasing automations you have personally built and deployed at scale

They depend on large teams and aging tools to manually produce content, oversee discussions, and mine insights from fragmented interactions. Even with the rise of AI, deploying a simple automation typically takes weeks, and most initiatives remain stuck in perpetual ""pilot"" mode. The outcome is wasted potential, exhausted staff, and infrastructure that struggles to match the pace of today's business demands.
   

  

 IgniteTech is dismantling this outdated model. We replace manual processes with self\\-optimizing, AI\\-driven systems that operate at 10x the scale and speed. Picture a marketing infrastructure that generates and publishes content in response to live trends, or a community system that synthesizes, moderates, and channels insights within seconds—all designed, launched, and refined by a compact team of AI\\-fluent engineers working in 24\\-hour cycles. We don't stop at prototypes; we deliver production tools that immediately redefine operational workflows.
   

  

 This position is not for someone interested in managing Jira backlogs within a DevOps treadmill. You will not receive predefined specifications to implement. Instead, you will assume full ownership of intelligent systems that automate and advance our client operations. You will surface bottlenecks, design AI\\-centric solutions, deploy MVPs in less than a day, and mature them into robust production engines with measurable impact. If your goal is a sandbox for GenAI experimentation, look elsewhere. But if you intend to use GenAI as a strategic tool, this is where you belong.
   

  

 You will join a small, high\\-caliber team reconstructing the operational blueprint of entire business functions with AI as the foundation. You will work directly with decision\\-makers, execute rapidly, and evaluate your contributions by tangible business results. If this environment aligns with your ambitions, apply now!
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Design and deploy functional AI prototypes within 24 hours that instantly automate live business workflows
* Assume end\\-to\\-end ownership of AI solutions, spanning design, deployment, and monitoring, without dependencies or delays
* Sustain continuous automation throughout the organization by surfacing new opportunities and refining existing solutions to match shifting needs and emerging capabilities


**Technical Lead Key Responsibilities**
* Construct a fully reimagined, AI\\-driven ecosystem that converts manual marketing operations and community platforms into intelligent systems delivering 10x business impact


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your default approach is to write code first and then apply AI tools for verification or enhancement, rather than leading with AI, please do not apply)
* A minimum of 5 years of full\\-stack software engineering experience (you must possess both front\\-end and back\\-end development expertise)
* Professional experience embedding AI/LLMs (through APIs, prompt engineering, or automation) into production applications
* Proficiency with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and constructing scalable, distributed architectures
* Understanding of when and why to select specific LLM models for distinct use cases
* Demonstrated knowledge and prior implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

They depend on large teams and aging tools to manually produce content, oversee discussions, and mine insights from fragmented interactions. Even with the rise of AI, deploying a simple automation typically takes weeks, and most initiatives remain stuck in perpetual ""pilot"" mode. The outcome is wasted potential, exhausted staff, and infrastructure that struggles to match the pace of today's business demands.
   

  

 IgniteTech is dismantling this outdated model. We replace manual processes with self\\-optimizing, AI\\-driven systems that operate at 10x the scale and speed. Picture a marketing infrastructure that generates and publishes content in response to live trends, or a community system that synthesizes, moderates, and channels insights within seconds—all designed, launched, and refined by a compact team of AI\\-fluent engineers working in 24\\-hour cycles. We don't stop at prototypes; we deliver production tools that immediately redefine operational workflows.
   

  

 This position is not for someone interested in managing Jira backlogs within a DevOps treadmill. You will not receive predefined specifications to implement. Instead, you will assume full ownership of intelligent systems that automate and advance our client operations. You will surface bottlenecks, design AI\\-centric solutions, deploy MVPs in less than a day, and mature them into robust production engines with measurable impact. If your goal is a sandbox for GenAI experimentation, look elsewhere. But if you intend to use GenAI as a strategic tool, this is where you belong.
   

  

 You will join a small, high\\-caliber team reconstructing the operational blueprint of entire business functions with AI as the foundation. You will work directly with decision\\-makers, execute rapidly, and evaluate your contributions by tangible business results. If this environment aligns with your ambitions, apply now!
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Design and deploy functional AI prototypes within 24 hours that instantly automate live business workflows
* Assume end\\-to\\-end ownership of AI solutions, spanning design, deployment, and monitoring, without dependencies or delays
* Sustain continuous automation throughout the organization by surfacing new opportunities and refining existing solutions to match shifting needs and emerging capabilities


**Technical Lead Key Responsibilities**
* Construct a fully reimagined, AI\\-driven ecosystem that converts manual marketing operations and community platforms into intelligent systems delivering 10x business impact


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your default approach is to write code first and then apply AI tools for verification or enhancement, rather than leading with AI, please do not apply)
* A minimum of 5 years of full\\-stack software engineering experience (you must possess both front\\-end and back\\-end development expertise)
* Professional experience embedding AI/LLMs (through APIs, prompt engineering, or automation) into production applications
* Proficiency with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and constructing scalable, distributed architectures
* Understanding of when and why to select specific LLM models for distinct use cases
* Demonstrated knowledge and prior implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

 We're looking for a smart, motivated, and results\\-oriented Software Development Engineer II who is passionate about building AI\\-driven automation systems that transform operational complexity into seamless customer experiences. You'll be instrumental in developing the intelligent systems, automation frameworks, and operational tooling that enable autonomous management of hundreds of thousands of live events and linear stations.
   

  

 This role sits at the intersection of AI/ML, distributed systems, and operational excellence. You'll build systems that learn from operational patterns, make intelligent decisions about playback quality, and automatically resolve issues before customers notice. Your work will directly impact whether millions of viewers experience perfect playback.
   

  

 Key job responsibilities
   

  

**As An SDE II On Our Team, You Will**
 Develop AI\\-powered operational intelligence systems that analyze telemetry data, detect anomalies, and make autonomous decisions about event health and intervention strategies
   

  

 Build automated incident response frameworks that reduce mean time to recovery through intelligent root cause analysis and automated remediation
   

  

 Create scalable automation pipelines that handle event lifecycle management—from technical on boarding and readiness validation to live execution and post\\-event analysis
   

  

 Design customercentric quality assessment systems that evaluate playback from the viewer's perspective, not just technical metrics, ensuring our interventions improve rather than disrupt the viewing experience
   

  

 Implement predictive analytics capabilities that identify potential failures before they occur, learning from historical patterns to prevent recurring issues
   

  

 Develop operational tooling and dashboards that provide real\\-time visibility into system health, AI decision\\-making, and quality metrics across our global operations
   

  

 You'll work with technologies spanning machine learning frameworks, distributed systems, real\\-time data processing, and cloud infrastructure. Your systems will need to operate reliably at Amazon scale—handling massive telemetry volumes, making sub\\-second decisions, and maintaining 24/7 availability across global time zones.
   

  

 A day in the life
   

  

 You start your morning analyzing overnight performance data from your automated quality system. During a live sports event, it detected micro\\-stuttering but intelligently chose not to intervene—avoiding worse disruption for viewers. You investigate the root cause, discovering patterns in CDN behavior during high\\-concurrency scenarios.
   

  

 You design and implement ML\\-enhanced detection logic, validate it against production data, and document everything thoroughly. Code reviews, architecture discussions, and collaboration with data scientists fill your afternoon as you continuously improve the system's predictive capabilities.
   

  

 By evening, your automation is autonomously managing live events for millions of viewers—detecting, analyzing, and resolving issues before operations teams even notice.
   

  

 You're building intelligent systems at the intersection of AI, distributed systems, and live video—where impact is immediate and every improvement prevents real incidents at massive scale.
   

  

**About The Team**
 The Prime Video Playback Operations team ensures flawless viewing experiences for millions of customers watching live sports, breaking news, concerts, and linear programming worldwide. We operate 24/7 across global time zones, managing over hundreds of thousands annual events today—a number projected to grow by triple\\-digit percentage year over year.
   

  

 We're in the midst of a transformative journey to build AI\\-powered autonomous operations system. We except that all operational decisions are diagnosed and mitigated independently. This isn't incremental improvement; it's re\\-imagining how operations scale.
   

  

**Basic Qualifications**
* 3\\+ years of non\\-internship professional software development experience
* 2\\+ years of non\\-internship design or architecture (design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and existing systems experience
* 3\\+ years of programming with at least one software programming language experience
