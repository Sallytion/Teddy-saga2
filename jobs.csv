**About The Role**
 We’re looking for an
 **early\\-career software engineer** 
 who loves to build, learn, and ship. This isn’t a role where you’ll just “write tickets.” You’ll join a small, empowered product team and contribute directly to real features that reach thousands of users.
   

  

 We care more about
 **what you’ve built** 
 than where you’ve worked. Personal projects, open\\-source contributions, or side apps matter as much as your degree. If you’re curious, self\\-motivated, and want to learn how great products are made — this is for you.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Build real features: Write production code in Angular and TypeScript that users actually touch.
* Learn the full stack: Get hands\\-on experience with AWS Lambda, Java/Node.js, and CI/CD pipelines.
* Collaborate cross\\-functionally: Work with product managers and designers to solve user problems, not just technical tasks.
* Experiment and iterate: Use feature flags (GrowthBook, LaunchDarkly, etc.) to safely ship and learn.
* Grow your craft: Participate in code reviews, pair programming, and mentorship sessions with senior engineers.
* Show initiative: Bring your ideas and projects to life — we value builders and problem\\-solvers.


**What You Bring**
* Bachelor’s degree (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field.
* Strong English communication — clear writing and willingness to ask good questions.
* Solid understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Exposure to Angular, React, or any modern front\\-end framework.
* Curiosity about AWS Lambda or serverless architectures.
* Demonstrated passion through personal projects, hackathons, open\\-source work, or side apps.
* Willingness to learn, experiment, and take ownership of your growth.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience deploying projects to AWS, Vercel, or Cloudflare.
* Familiarity with GitHub Actions or other CI/CD automation tools.
* Some backend exposure — Java (Spring Boot) or Node.js.
* Basic understanding of feature flags or A/B testing.
* Contributions to open\\-source projects or a portfolio on GitHub.


**How We Work**
 We believe in
 **empowered product teams** 
 — small, autonomous groups of engineers, designers, and PMs who own outcomes, not tasks.
   

  

 You’ll learn to think like a
 **product engineer** 
 — balancing technical quality, user needs, and business value.
   

  

 We’ll invest in your
 **growth, autonomy, and mastery** 
 — and expect you to bring energy, curiosity, and craftsmanship every day.
   

  

**You’re a Fit If You…**
* Love building things that people actually use.
* Learn fast and take initiative — you don’t wait to be told what to do.
* Care about writing clean, thoughtful code. See mistakes as part of progress.
* Want to grow into a product\\-minded engineer, not just a coder.

**The Team:**
 You will be joining the Business Apps department. Our mission is to build end\\-to\\-end solutions on the Celonis platform, including data models and end\\-user applications, to accelerate time to value for our customers and partners.

**The Role:**
 As a Data Engineer, you will own and focus on primarily two aspects: On the one hand, refining prebuilt transformations for existing ontologies (for processes like Order to Cash, Procure to Pay, Inventory Management) for SAP, Oracle etc and validating them across our early adopters in our customer base. On the other, defining and extending the existing ontologies with additional processes and extending to additional systems. In addition, you would also be responsible for maintaining the quality of content that we produce, and write documentation on the ontology definitions.

* Test and validate the models in development environments and customer environments to gather early feedback
* Document the data model governing principles and development


**The qualifications you need:** 
  

  

* You have that rare combination—a strong technical expertise and business acumen. You’ll use this to build a system\\-agnostic data model for various business processes.
* 3\\+ years of experience working in the data field as a Data Engineer, Data Analyst or similar.
* Must\\-have: Experience working with data from at least one of the following system types:
+ ERP (e.g. SAP ECC or S/4, Oracle EBS or Fusion)
+ Supply Chain Management (e.g. BlueYonder, SAP or Oracle Transportation Management)
+ CRM (e.g. Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics)
+ IT (e.g. ServiceNow)

* Strong solution designing skills with solid understanding of business processes (supply chain, financial, CRM or IT\\-related processes) and data beneath the IT systems that run these processes.
* Experience with databases and data modeling, and hands\\-on experience with SQL.
* Ability to work independently and own a part of the team’s goals
