* What’s freight forwarding and why does it matter? Freight forwarding is the coordination and shipment of goods from one place to another and it’s what makes global trade possible. Flexport is on a mission to make global trade easier for everyone because we believe it can help connect the world and break down economic barriers.
* We know this industry is complex. That’s why we invest in education starting day one with Flexport Academy, a one\\-week intensive onboarding program designed specifically to set every new Flexport employee up for success.
