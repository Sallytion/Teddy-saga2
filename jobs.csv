 **About Wastel**
 Wastel is building the digital backbone for India’s circular economy.
   

 Our platform converts agricultural, industrial, municipal, and food waste into traceable, verifiable climate assets \\- biofuels, carbon credits, and pollution\\-permit trades.
   

  

 We’re developing a multi\\-role marketplace backed by:
   

* AI\\-driven waste mapping
* IoT\\-based field\\-level traceability
* Blockchain\\-ready carbon accounting
* A district\\-hub operating model


 Your work will directly influence India’s climate transition and impact real CO₂ reduction across industries.
   

  

**🎯 Role Overview**
 We are looking for a Senior FlutterFlow Developer who can build Wastel’s entire MVP \\- from design to deployment \\- using FlutterFlow and supporting integrations.
   

 This is a founding engineering role with equity compensation, ideal for someone who wants to help shape a real climate\\-tech product used across India.
   

  

 You won’t just build screens \\- you’ll architect flows, build the backend connections, create dashboards, optimize performance, and ensure Wastel runs smoothly in real\\-world field conditions.
   

  

 💬
 **Why Join Us at Wastel?
   

  

 If you're a builder at heart, this is the kind of role you only get once in your career. At Wastel, you're not just writing code — you’re engineering India’s next big climate\\-tech infrastructure.
   

  

 🌍 Real Impact
   

 Every feature you ship reduces open\\-field burning, lowers industrial emissions, and replaces fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives. Your code directly contributes to India’s Net Zero mission.
   

  

 ⚙️ 0 → 1 Ownership
   

 You won’t be a small cog in a large machine. You’ll be the founding engineer who designs systems, builds the MVP, shapes our tech stack, and influences the future architecture.
   

  

 📈 Equity, Not Just Salary
   

 You own a piece of the product you’re building. As Wastel scales nationwide — district hubs, carbon credit markets, biofuel supply chains — your equity grows in value.
   

  

 🚀 A Massive Market Waiting to Be Digitized
   

 India produces 1 billion\\+ tonnes of waste annually, yet there is no national digital infrastructure to monetize it.
   

 Wastel is building the first integrated waste\\-to\\-energy \\+ carbon marketplace — and you will architect the engine that powers it.
   

  

 🤖 A Playground for Innovation
   

 AI waste mapping, IoT\\-based traceability, carbon accounting, blockchain verification — if you want to work on frontier tech, this is it.
   

  

 💡 Build What Actually Gets Used
   

 Your app will be used on farms, factories, warehouses, and industrial hubs across India — not just sitting on a corporate server.
   

  

 👥 Direct Collaboration With Founders
   

 No bureaucracy. No layers. Just fast execution, creative freedom, and real ownership.**
