 Experience Level: 0\\-5 years
 



  





**About Vaatun** 




 Vaatun is an early\\-stage insurtech company building the AI\\-powered operating system for the Indian insurance ecosystem. We engineer intelligent, next\\-generation systems for both insurance intermediaries and the insurers they partner with. Our mission is to eliminate mundane work and bring US\\-level productivity to the market through a relentless focus on AI, automation, and exceptional user experience.
 



 We are a small, focused team moving at high velocity. We don't believe in bureaucracy or compromising on technical excellence.
 



  





**The Role** 




 We're looking for a sharp, product\\-minded Software Engineer to join our core team. You will be instrumental in building and scaling our platform. You won't be a cog in a machine; you'll be shipping high\\-impact features across our entire stack, from the database to the UI. Your work will directly influence our product direction, client success, and our expansion into new systems for insurers.
 



 This isn't a role for someone who needs constant hand\\-holding. We need a builder who can take ownership, move fast, and write clean, scalable code.
 



  





**What You'll Do** 



* **Build \\& Ship:** 
 Design, develop, and deploy end\\-to\\-end features for our core products, Vantage and Advantage, using our modern tech stack.
* **Own the Stack:** 
 Work with React, Node.js (Express), tRPC, Prisma, and PostgreSQL to deliver robust and performant solutions.
* **Build for Scale and Handoff:** 
 Write clean, modular, and well\\-documented code designed for rapid iteration and team growth. Your work will enable new engineers to onboard quickly and contribute effectively.
* **Shape the Core Platform:** 
 Contribute to foundational systems that will power not only our current products but also our future next\\-generation solutions for insurers.
* **Solve Real Problems:** 
 Collaborate directly with the founders to understand complex insurance workflows and translate them into simple, elegant software solutions.
* **Drive Technical Excellence:** 
 Participate in architectural decisions, code reviews, and help maintain the high quality bar required to win in a competitive market.



  





**What We're Looking For** 



* **TypeScript Proficiency:** 
 Deep proficiency in TypeScript across both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) environments. You write clean, strongly\\-typed, and maintainable code.
* **Generative AI Experience:** 
 Hands\\-on experience building applications with Generative AI SDKs (e.g., OpenAI, LangChain, or similar). You're excited by the potential of LLMs to transform complex business workflows.
* **Strong Low\\-Level Design Skills:** 
 You can break down complex features into clean, reusable, and efficient components and data structures. You think critically about system architecture and its implications.
* **Product\\-First Mindset:** 
 You care about the ""why"" behind what you're building. You're motivated by solving user problems and delivering value, not just closing tickets.
* **High Agency:** 
 You're an autonomous operator who can take a loosely defined problem, figure out the solution, and execute on it without needing constant oversight.
* **Excellent Communication Skills:** 
 You can clearly articulate technical concepts to both technical and non\\-technical stakeholders and thrive in a collaborative, fast\\-paced setting.



  





**Note:** 
 We are looking for candidates who can join immediately or have a short notice period.
 



  





**Why Join Vaatun?** 



* **Massive Impact:** 
 You'll be one of the first engineers, shaping the technical foundation and culture of a company poised to disrupt a massive industry.
* **Unparalleled Ownership:** 
 Take full ownership of features from concept to deployment. Your decisions will matter.
* **Modern Tech \\& Best Practices:** 
 Work with a modern, enjoyable tech stack and a team that prioritizes great DX and engineering principles.
* **Direct Mentorship:** 
 Work directly alongside the co\\-founders, including a CTO who is deeply technical and invested in your growth.
* **Build the Future:** 
 Be at the forefront of applying AI to solve real\\-world business challenges across the entire insurance value chain.","Technology, Information and Media","https://in.linkedin.com/company/vaatun","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEXRLw8HMqepg/company-logo_100_100/B56ZXWNyy7GUAY-/0/1743055695949?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=510OcHduJBt57bt2U3a2DUmpZfUg3BjBsefQlcUF9lQ","","","","","","","","","","",""
