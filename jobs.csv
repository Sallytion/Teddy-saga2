 We are a highly collaborative team of builders and operators who invent new ways of working in an industry that historically has resisted innovation. Join us!
 


**About the Role** 

 You are an engineer who, above all, is excited to build products that give our customers the best possible experience purchasing prescription medications. You have professional experience working on a team turning ideas into reliable, maintainable code — and ideally, you are eager to apply

**Good Feedback — Consider the perspective of others** 
* Listen actively and respond effectively through a variety of channels
* Give and receive candid and constructive feedback
* Promote trust and encourage teamwork to allow the product team to do their best work


**Desired Experience**

* Enjoy writing code that is understandable, maintainable, and testable
* Collaborative and communicative — you love being part of a diverse team, building consensus, and establishing credibility. You are a Class\\-A communicator: curious, thoughtful, clear, and (mostly) correct.

 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea.

You’ll bring deep Workday functional knowledge and strong QA engineering capabilities comparable to our Systems and Software Engineers, applying engineering rigor to enterprise\\-grade testing in a fast\\-paced environment.
 



 Scope includes Workday HCM, Benefits, Absence, Compensation, Payroll, Extend, Recruiting/ATS tech stack (HiredScore and Paradox), Learning, Talent Management, and Peakon (Employee Voice). You’ll build robust, scalable automated test suites using Tricentis Tosca and manage lifecycle quality and reporting in qTest, ensuring our Workday ecosystem meets business, compliance, data security, and integrity requirements in a rapidly growing company.
 



  
 



**What you’ll be doing** 



* Define and own the end\\-to\\-end Workday QA strategy across HCM, Benefits, Absence, Compensation, Payroll, Extend, ATS Tech Stack (Recruiting, HiredScore), Learning, Talent Management, and Peakon — balancing risk\\-based testing with speed to delivery.
* Build, maintain, and scale automated test coverage with Tricentis Tosca; manage test design, execution, and traceability in qTest; and integrate results into CI/CD pipelines for continuous quality signals.
* Design comprehensive regression and release certification suites for Workday weekly/feature updates and semi\\-annual releases; lead go/no\\-go quality gates and defect triage for enterprise releases.
* Create reusable test assets and frameworks (modular test cases, reusable business process steps, data setups, stubs/mocks for downstream integrations) that shorten cycle time and improve reliability.
* Drive API\\-level, integration, and end\\-to\\-end scenario testing across People processes (e.g., hire\\-to\\-payroll, job/comp changes, leaves, benefits events, performance cycles, learning assignments, surveys/voice), including Workday web services, EIB/RaaS, and vendor integrations.
* Validate Workday Extend apps and configurations to ensure functional correctness, security, accessibility, and performance under load for enterprise usage patterns.
* Establish quality metrics, dashboards, and reporting (including coverage, defect density/severity/MTTR, reliability, pass rates, and release readiness) that enable data\\-driven decision\\-making.
* Champion shift\\-left practices: embed test design in requirements, partner with Workday configuration and integration engineers on design reviews and apply code\\-review rigor to test assets.
* Lead root cause analysis and drive systemic quality improvements across processes, data, and tooling; continuously optimize testing efficiency and effectiveness.
* Collaborate closely with HR Technology, Security, Compliance, Payroll, People Ops, and vendor partners to align quality outcomes with business priorities and regulatory requirements.



  
 



**We’re excited if you have** 



* 8\\+ years with SaaS/Cloud HR technology and significant hands\\-on Workday experience across HCM, Benefits, Absence, Compensation, Payroll, Extend, Recruiting/ATS (HiredScore), Learning, Talent Management, and Peakon.
* Demonstrated success operating at enterprise scale in high\\-growth environments: large user populations, complex security models, multi\\-cycle releases, and mission\\-critical HR/Payroll processes.
* Expert\\-level QA skills for SaaS apps: test strategy, risk analysis, test design, execution, and release\\-quality reporting for complex cross\\-domain scenarios.
* Strong automation background with Tricentis Tosca (model\\-based test design, reusable modules, data\\-driven testing) and lifecycle management in qTest.
* Proficiency testing Workday APIs and integrations (REST/SOAP, EIB, RaaS, inbound/outbound vendor flows); comfort with test data management, environment strategy, and production validation.
* Engineering rigor similar to our Systems/Software Engineers: version control for test assets, code review discipline, CI/CD integration, metrics\\-driven decision\\-making; scripting familiarity is a plus (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Groovy).
* Strength in defect analysis and hands\\-on troubleshooting across distributed, integrated systems; clear documentation and communication of findings and impact.
* Excellent cross\\-functional communication; able to educate and align stakeholders at all levels on quality strategy, tradeoffs, and release readiness.
* Soft skills that fit Roku’s culture: low ego, high ownership, bias for action, curiosity, pragmatism, and collaborative problem\\-solving in a fast\\-paced environment.









  
 


**Our Hybrid Work Approach**

**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""
