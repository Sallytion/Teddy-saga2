 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.

We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.
