**BACKEND \\& INTEGRATION COMMANDO WANTED** 




  





**THE MISSION — READ THIS OR DON’T BOTHER** 




 We're building a B2B HR tech product from ZERO to REVENUE in 30 days.
 



 If you don't live for building scalable systems under impossible deadlines, close this tab now.
 



 This isn't a backend job. This is a production battlefield.
 



 We need 1–2 absolutely insane engineers who can build the plumbing, integrations, and APIs that will make or break us.
 



  





**WE'RE NOT OFFERING:** 




 Money (we're bootstrapping to survive)
 



 Clean, well\\-documented legacy systems
 



 Time to ""architect"" — you architect while building
 



 Hand\\-holding or corporate training programs
 



  





**WE'RE OFFERING:** 




 Real scars from building scalable backends that actually scale
 



 Actual enterprise integration experience — not tutorial projects
 



 A portfolio that proves you can connect anything to anything
 



 Stories about that time you integrated Zoho while debugging Supabase at 3 AM
 



 Potential equity if you survive and want to keep going
 



  





**THE INSANE PLAN** 




  





**PHASE 1: BATTLE MODE** 




 Goal: MVP backend that doesn't collapse under first 100 users
 



 Week 1: Supabase schema design \\+ API contracts
 



 Week 2–3: Building integrations while the frontend team breathes down your neck
 



 Week 4: Debugging live while we sell to actual businesses
 



  





**PHASE 2: SURVIVAL MODE** 




 Goal: Keep the backend alive when everything breaks
 



 Handle real customer data without leaking it
 



 Integrate GCP because our server costs are exploding
 



 Connect Zoho Billing because we need to actually get paid
 



**PHASE 3: GROWTH MODE** 




 Goal: Scale or watch the database catch fire
 



 Optimize queries that are slowing everything down
 



 Build APIs that enterprise clients won't laugh at
 



 Either we make it or we learn why our backend couldn't handle it
 



  





**WHAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY DO** 




 Design Supabase schemas at 2 AM because we need it live yesterday
 



 Build REST/GraphQL APIs that connect our AI models to the frontend
 



 Integrate GCP services when our cheap server explodes
 



 Connect Zoho Billing because revenue \\> pretty code
 



 Debug integration hell when three services break at once
 



 Talk to enterprise IT teams without sounding like an idiot
 



 Deploy to production and pray it doesn't crash immediately
 



  





**NON\\-NEGOTIABLE TECH STACK** 




 Core Stack (You Must Know This):
 



 Supabase — schema design, RLS, migrations, real\\-time
 



 PostgreSQL — if you don't know indexes, don't apply
 



 Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI — pick your weapon
 



 REST/GraphQL APIs — build them, test them, break them, fix them
 



 Git/GitHub — your lifeline
 



 Integration Battlefield (You Will Learn This):
 



 GCP — Cloud SQL, IAM, Pub/Sub, and why cloud bills hurt
 



 Zoho API — because businesses need to pay us
 



 Enterprise authentication — OAuth, JWT, SSO, security that doesn't suck
 



 Message queues — when async is the difference between working and dead
 



  





**WHO WE WANT** 




 The Backend Commando:
 



 Someone who sees ""scale to enterprise"" as a fun Friday night
 



 An engineer who'd rather build something that works than something that's beautiful
 



 A human who can talk to clients and code in the same hour
 



 Someone who understands that ""production\\-ready"" means ""won't crash at 3 AM""
 



  





**MINIMUM BATTLE REQUIREMENTS** 




 Hands\\-on Supabase experience — show us schemas you've built
 



 API design skills — REST/GraphQL, documentation, testing
 



 PostgreSQL knowledge — queries, optimization, WTF is an index
 



 Cloud exposure — GCP, AWS, or Azure — you've deployed something
 



 Integration experience — connected APIs that actually matter
 



 Located in India \\+ available 15–20 hours/week for 6 months
 



 Problem\\-solving mindset — when it breaks, you fix it, no whining
 



  





**NICE\\-TO\\-HAVE (BUT WE'LL TEACH YOU):** 




 Experience with enterprise SaaS integrations
 



 Knowledge of CI/CD, Docker, DevOps
 



 Familiarity with authentication/authorization flows
 



 Exposure to message queues or event\\-driven systems
 



  





**SELECTION PROCESS** 




 Step 1: Prove You're Not Normal
 



 Show us a Supabase schema you designed or an API you built that solved a real problem
 



 Step 2: Battle Test
 



 We'll give you a real integration problem and 48 hours to build a solution
 



 Step 3: Reality Check
 



 We'll tell you exactly how impossible this is. If you're still interested, you're in.
 



  





**THE HARD TRUTH** 




 This will be the hardest backend work of your life. You will:
 



 Debug database locks at 4 AM
 



 Explain to founders why their ""simple feature"" requires a migration
 



 Integrate systems with documentation from 2008
 



 Question every life choice that led you here
 



 Probably dream in SQL
 



  





 But you'll also:
 



 Learn more about scalable backends in 6 months than most engineers learn in 5 years
 



 Build a portfolio that makes recruiters throw money at you
 



 Understand what it actually takes to run production systems
 



 Either help build something amazing or learn exactly why it failed
 



  





**HOW TO APPLY** 




 If you're still reading this and thinking ""I want to build that backend"":
 


1. Send your GitHub (or project links)
2. One paragraph on why you're the right kind of crazy
3. One example of an integration you built or scaled



  





 Application deadline: When we find 1–2 backend commandos who won't quit.
 



  





 ""If your backend doesn't keep you up at night, it's not important enough.""
 



  





 — Someone who probably fixed a production issue while writing this
