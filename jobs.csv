This is a stretch role. You’ll be pushed past your comfort zone—and supported to level up fast.
 



  





**What you’ll do** 



* Prototype and ship agentic flows (LangGraph/CrewAI) for research, scraping, and automation.
* Wire up retrieval/RAG basics: chunking, embeddings, vector stores, eval harnesses.
* Write clean, tested Python (type hints, docstrings, unit tests) and ship weekly.
* Investigate unfamiliar tech, compare options, and recommend a path—then implement it.



  





**Must\\-haves** 



* Strong Python 3\\.x fundamentals: functions, classes, modules, typing, packaging, venv/poetry/pip.
* Comfortable with Git, CLI, HTTP/REST, JSON, and basic SQL (Postgres/MySQL).
* NumPy/Pandas/Jupyter basics; you can explore data and not get lost.
* You’ve tried at least some of: Transformers/LLMs, embeddings, vector DBs, RAG, prompt design.
* Research horsepower: you can read docs/issues/blogs and figure stuff out without hand\\-holding.
* Bias to ship: you prefer a scrappy working prototype over endless theory.



  





**Nice\\-to\\-haves (any 2–3 is great)** 



* FastAPI, Pydantic, pytest.
* Docker basics; Linux comfort.
* LangGraph, CrewAI, or LangChain experience.
* Postgres \\+ SQLAlchemy/Prisma\\-style thinking; Redis.
* Basic front\\-end literacy to test your APIs (Next.js/React or simple HTML forms).



  





**How we work** 



* High ownership, fast feedback, low fluff. Expect to be stretched everyday!
* You’ll demo progress daily. Code reviews are kind but blunt.
* We care about readability, small PRs, and measurable outcomes.



  





**Role details** 



* Location: Remote (we're HQed in Bangalore).
* Type: Internship (6 months, paid) or Junior full\\-time based on fit/performance.
* Growth path: Clear milestones → more autonomy → own features/modules.



  





**How to apply (simple and specific)** 



* Fill in the in\\-take form.
* If you are shortlisted, you will receive a technical assessment.
* If your technical assessment is selected, you will have a final interview with the CEO.","Software Development","https://in.linkedin.com/company/instinctivestudio","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF1id91-pYeow/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1727237035012/instinctivestudio_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=k6JbYWOqnN49DwRhRlhXwzHqGQuPejGiyGDdMA8W0RQ","","","","","","","","","","",""

We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.
 



  
 



**About the role**

  
 




 Our 
 **Search Platform** 
  sits at the heart of the Roku experience, powering voice, text, and visual discovery across 
 **100M\\+ active accounts** 
  and every Roku\\-powered device worldwide.
   

  We own the entire stack —from ingesting \\& enriching a multi\\-million\\-title knowledge graph, to low\\-latency retrieval services and large\\-scale machine\\-learning systems that personalize results in real time. Our work doesn’t just help users 
 *find* 
  shows; it drives core product surfaces (home\\-screen rows, browse hubs, Roku Voice, mobile app search) and fuels partner monetization. If you enjoy turning cutting\\-edge research into products used billions of times a day, you’ll thrive here.
 




 Roku’s footprint has more than quadrupled in the past five years, and user expectations have leaped just as fast—think
 
**LLM\\-based query understanding, vector\\-DB retrieval, on\\-device models, and multimodal search**

 (voice, text, image). We’re now rebuilding our relevance stack for the next decade, blending classic IR with generative\\-AI techniques. You will be a technical leader spearheading that transformation.

* Good understanding of system architecture
* Experience in big data technologies and streaming architecture, data pipelines, etc.
* MS in Computer Science, Statistics, or related field, but a Ph.D. in CS or related fields is preferred

**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.
