**Role Overview** 




 We're looking for our founding Platform Engineer to build our infrastructure from the ground up. This isn't about maintaining existing systems \\- it's about architecting the foundation that will scale from thousands to millions of property measurements.
 



 As our first dedicated Platform Engineer, you'll have the rare opportunity to make architectural decisions that will impact the company for years to come. You'll transform our current infrastructure into a world\\-class platform that balances the speed of a startup with the security standards of an enterprise.
 



 You'll work directly with our CTO and engineering leadership to define our infrastructure philosophy. Every decision you make \\- from our CI/CD pipeline to our security architecture \\- will set the standard for how we build and ship software. This is a role for someone who wants to own outcomes, not just execute tasks.

* **Developer Platform Creation**
* Build the self\\-service platform that lets developers provision infrastructure in minutes, not days
* Create golden paths that make the secure, scalable choice the default choice

**You're Right For This If You** 



* Want to be ""the DevOps person"" everyone comes to, not just another engineer on the team
* Get excited about making architectural decisions that will matter for years
* Believe infrastructure should be invisible when it works and helpful when it doesn't
* Can balance startup speed with enterprise reliability
* Want to build the platform you wish you had at your last company



 What You'll Build in Year One
 


* Complete infrastructure migration to Infrastructure\\-as\\-Code
* Sub\\-5 minute deployments with automatic rollbacks
* 99\\.9% uptime with comprehensive monitoring
