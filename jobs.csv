 , we build systems that value engineering judgment over framework trivia. This role is for an experienced mobile engineer who understands JavaScript and runtime behavior deeply, and can reason about complex, real\\-world React Native apps.

 What You’ll Do
 * Own and evolve a production\\-grade React Native application with real users and constraints.
* Design clean state, data\\-flow, and async boundaries
* Collaborate closely with backend and web (Next.js) engineers to align data contracts and share logic
* Lead parts of our Flutter → React Native migration and/or maintenance strategy.

Here, you lead with innovative thinking, grow along with us, and join the smartest team in the industry.
   

  

 This type of work—work that changes the world—is what the tech industry was founded on. So, if you're ready to seize the endless opportunities and leave your mark, come join us.
   

  

**THE ROLE**
 As a Member of Technical Staff within the NAND \\& Drive Qualification Team, you will serve as a senior technical authority and the Center of Excellence lead for hyperscale and system\\-level validation. Your mission is to architect the strategy that demonstrates the performance, reliability, and firmware maturity of Pure\\-developed Direct Flash Modules (DFMs). This is a high\\-impact, hands\\-on leadership role where you will own major technical domains—such as PCIe/NVMe/OCP compliance and NAND reliability—guiding our products from early concept to hyperscale deployment while mentoring the next generation of engineers.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* Architect and lead end\\-to\\-end validation strategies for critical domains, including NAND policy, power\\-loss robustness (PLP), and complex system\\-level stress tests (e.g., snapshot and secure boot).
* Design and engineer advanced validation suites and automation frameworks, converting complex manual demonstrations into scalable, repeatable Jenkins CI pipelines and analytics\\-driven workflows.
* Drive complex debug efforts and root\\-cause analysis across firmware, hardware, and system layers, utilizing log\\-based forensics (telemetry, NVMe/OCP logs) to ensure product stability.
* Act as the primary technical representative for Drive Qualification in cross\\-functional forums, influencing FW release councils, quality reviews, and joint\\-qualification discussions with hyperscale customers.
* Elevate team capabilities by prototyping non\\-deterministic test methods and mentoring IC3/IC4 engineers on advanced test design, data analysis, and coding standards within large shared codebases.


**What You Bring**
* Extensive technical leadership experience in storage, SSD, or firmware validation, with a proven track record of taking enterprise\\-class products from early silicon through GA.
* Expert\\-level software engineering skills, specifically in Python, with a focus on building modular, maintainable test frameworks and automation tools in a Linux environment.
* Deep technical mastery of SSD protocols, including NVMe, PCIe (lane glitch, resets, link\\-width transitions), and OCP specifications for telemetry and latency monitoring.
* Comprehensive understanding of NAND fundamentals, such as P/E cycling, read\\-disturb, data retention, and EOL behavior, as well as experience with fault\\-injection and stress testing.
* Analytical proficiency with a demonstrated ability to define quality metrics and utilize data platforms (e.g., Snowflake, Tableau) to create automated\\-triage pipelines and maturity dashboards.
* We are primarily an in\\-office environment and therefore, you will be expected to work from the Bengaluru (Blr) office in compliance with Pure’s policies, unless you are on PTO, or work travel, or other approved leave.


**What You Can Expect From Us**
* Pure Innovation: We celebrate those who think critically, like a challenge and aspire to be trailblazers.
* Pure Growth: We give you the space and support to grow along with us and to contribute to something meaningful. We have been Named Fortune's Best Large Workplaces in the Bay Area™, Fortune's Best Workplaces for Millennials™ and certified as a Great Place to Work®!
