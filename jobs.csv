 We are the Common Platform Engineering \\- Gen AI team, a central group in the Chief Technology Office (CTO). We're a focused agile team that owns our work from idea to production.
   

  

 Our culture is built on a shared belief in engineering craftsmanship, backed by leadership that understands what that means. We're on a journey to prove what's possible inside a large organization, and that means navigating some legacy while building the future. This isn't a role for someone who wants everything to be perfect on day one. It's for an engineer who wants to be part of the team that gets us there, influencing how we solve problems and raising our collective bar through their work.
   

  

 We have a dual mission: build 'Citi Assist,' the GenAI digital assistant for our colleagues, and provide the platforms and guidance that enable the entire organisation to adopt GenAI safely and effectively.
   

  

 This is not a typical banking job. You will build foundational technology that has a direct, positive impact on hundreds of thousands of people. You'll have the executive support to tackle big problems and the autonomy to help shape our solutions. Most importantly, you will join a passionate, collaborative team where we all learn from each other, and we succeed or fail as one.
