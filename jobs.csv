 Senior Frontend Engineer (SDE\\-3\\) who can combine hands\\-on engineering with technical leadership.
   

  

 Someone who enjoys building, scaling, and securing frontend systems from the ground up while guiding a small team to do the same.
   

  

 This role goes beyond feature delivery; you'll manage infra, shape engineering practices, and set the direction for how we scale our products.
   

  

 Perfect for someone who's a builder at heart, excited by tough problems, and comfortable working in an early\\-stage startup :

* Go deep into performance and infra: optimise bundles, Core Web Vitals, caching, and monitoring at scale.
* Define engineering practices: CI/CD pipelines, testing frameworks, observability, and security standards for frontend.
* Operate like an owner: manage infra pieces (cloud\\-native setups, deployments, monitoring tools) where frontend needs to tie into platform reliability.
* Collaborate closely with backend and product to solve cross\\-cutting problems (latency, API contracts, data flows).
* Mentor and lead engineers in the team, raising the engineering bar through design/code reviews and technical strategy.
* Balance short\\-term delivery with long\\-term scalability, helping the team ship fast without compromising architecture.


**Requirements**
* 5 to 8 years building production\\-grade frontend applications at scale.
* Expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, and at least one modern framework (React/Angular).
* Strong grasp of frontend architecture patterns, state management, and performance tuning.
* Experience working with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and cloud\\-native environments.
* Prior experience in early\\-stage teams or building products from scratch.
* Experience with SEO and PWA.
* Built products from scratch or have previous experience working at a start\\-up.
* Ability to mentor engineers and drive technical decision\\-making.
* A history of working on side/hobby projects and contributing to open source projects
