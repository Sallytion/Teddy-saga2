A customer journey is the entire process of a customer’s interactions with the brand, from the first moment of contact until the customer leaves. It starts with the awareness phase, where the customer learns about the brand and starts engaging. The customer will then interact further, visit online and physical sites, and make purchases, send messages, or post reviews. AJO is built natively on the Adobe Experience Platform and combines a unified, real\\-time customer profile, an API\\-first open framework, centralized offer decisioning, and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for personalization and optimization. Journey Optimizer allows brands to thoughtfully resolve the next best interaction with scale, speed, and flexibility across the entire customer journey. With AJO, companies can build and deliver both scheduled marketing campaigns (such as weekly promotions for a retail store) and tailored individual communications (like a push notification for an item that a loyalty app customer may have looked at that was previously out of stock) within the same application. They can lead scheduled omnichannel campaigns and one\\-to\\-one moments for millions of their customers from a single application. Our Journey Orchestration team is at the heart of it all.**
