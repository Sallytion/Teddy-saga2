* Ensure Realism: Apply statistical methods and simulation techniques to introduce realistic noise, variations, and complexities into the generated data, making it indistinguishable from real\\-world customer data.
* Collaborate Across Teams: Work closely with value engineering, product management and product marketing to understand their needs and translate them into features for the data generation tools.
* Own the Lifecycle: Manage the entire project lifecycle from requirements gathering and design to implementation, testing, and documentation, ensuring the tools are accessible to a wide range of internal users.
