 Based in San Francisco, California, Turing is the world’s leading research accelerator for frontier AI labs and a trusted partner for global enterprises deploying advanced AI systems. Turing supports customers in two ways: first, by accelerating frontier research with high\\-quality data, advanced training pipelines, plus top AI researchers who specialize in coding, reasoning, STEM, multilinguality, multimodality, and agents; and second, by applying that expertise to help enterprises transform AI from proof of concept into proprietary intelligence with systems that perform reliably, deliver measurable impact, and drive lasting results on the P\\&L
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 We are seeking an AI Prompt \\& Policy Specialist to help design, evaluate, and improve how AI systems interact with tools, APIs, and users across multiple locales. In this role, you will work at the intersection of prompt engineering, policy design, and safety, ensuring that AI\\-driven workflows are accurate, compliant, and user\\-friendly.
 



 You will use your API/JSON literacy, SQL basics, policy creation skills, and strong critical reasoning to review, refine, and design prompts and behaviors for AI systems interacting with products like Slack, PayPal, and other third\\-party tools. This role also requires strong communication skills and awareness of safety and content filtering, especially across a wide range of languages and locales.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day life look like?** 



* Design, review, and refine prompts and instructions for AI systems interacting with tools, APIs, and external services.
* Read and understand API/JSON schemas and arguments to ensure correct parameter usage and tool behavior.
* Apply SQL basics to validate data, perform simple checks, and support analysis of AI or tool behavior.
* Create, document, and maintain policies and guidelines governing AI interactions, content handling, and tool workflows.
* Develop workflow knowledge for specific tools (e.g., Slack, PayPal and similar platforms) and encode that into prompts and policies.
* Ensure safety and compliance by applying content filtering guidelines and detecting unsafe or non\\-compliant outputs.
* Evaluate AI responses for critical reasoning quality, correctness of parameters, and adherence to policies.
