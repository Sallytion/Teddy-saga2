**Responsibilities:**

  
   

  



  
   

  




 Design and Execute Performance Tests: Develop and implement comprehensive test plans and scripts to evaluate the performance, scalability, and stability of LLM applications under various loads.
 


  
 


 Implement LLM Observability: Instrument LLM applications to capture rich telemetry data, including prompts, responses, token usage, latency, and error information, using specialized tools and frameworks like Datadog,
 
  
 


 LangChain
 

 , or
 


  
 


 OpenTelemetry
 

 .
 


  
 


 Monitor and Analyze Metrics: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, throughput, cost per query, accuracy, and resource utilization using real\\-time dashboards and monitoring
 
  
 


 systems.Identify
 


  
 
 and Mitigate Bottlenecks: Analyze performance test results and production data to pinpoint performance bottlenecks, errors, and potential issues (e.g., high latency in RAG pipelines) and collaborate with development teams
 
  
 


 onoptimization.Conduct
 


  
 
 Automated Evaluations: Implement automated quality checks and evaluations (e.g., hallucination detection, toxicity classifiers, relevance scoring) to continuously assess model output
 
  
 


 quality.Troubleshoot
 


  
 
 Production Issues: Utilize tracing and logging data to quickly diagnose the root cause of issues in complex LLM workflows and agentic
 
  
 


 applications.Ensure
 


  
 
 Security and Compliance: Monitor model behavior for potential security risks, such as prompt injections or sensitive data leaks, and ensure compliance with data protection
 
  
 


 regulations.Optimize
 


  
 
 Costs: Track and manage token usage and computational resource consumption to ensure cost\\-effectiveness and alert teams to potential budget
 
  
 


 overruns.Collaborate
 


  
 
 and Report: Work closely with data scientists, ML engineers, and QA teams to provide actionable
 
  
 


 insights and recommendations for model fine\\-tuning and system architecture improvements.
