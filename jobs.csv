* Control Plane Innovation: Mastery of Terraform and a transition\\-oriented mindset toward Kubernetes\\-native management (e.g., Crossplane). You know how to choose the right tool for the right abstraction level.
* Ecosystem Expertise: Hands\\-on experience with ArgoCD (GitOps), Helm, and GitHub Actions (designing enterprise\\-grade reusable workflows).
* Developer Experience (DevEx) \\& Portals: Proven experience building or maintaining an Internal Developer Portal (IDP). You understand how to map complex microservice architectures into a clean service catalog and have a passion for creating ""Golden Paths"" that make the developer journey seamless.


**What's Required For Application**
* Systems Thinking: The ability to troubleshoot complex, distributed system failures across networking, storage, and application layers.
* FinOps \\& Efficiency: A proven track record of optimizing large\\-scale cluster topologies to balance top\\-tier performance with aggressive cost\\-efficiency goals.
* Observability Architecture: Experience designing observability stacks using open\\-source tools like Prometheus, Grafana, VictoriaMetrics, or Thanos.
* Cloud Native Fluency: Deep familiarity with GCP (Cloud Run Functions, GKE) and AWS (EKS) in a multi\\-cloud or hybrid\\-cloud context.


**How You’ll Benefit**
* Attractive Discretionary Time Off
* Private Medical Insurance with optional dependent coverage
* Educational Assistance Reimbursement Program
* Opportunities for reimbursement for conferences, trainings, and other personal development events
* Maternity and Paternity Leave
* Ask recruiter for country specific information

**Role Overview:** 




 We are seeking an AI Prompt \\& Policy Specialist to help design, evaluate, and improve how AI systems interact with tools, APIs, and users across multiple locales. In this role, you will work at the intersection of prompt engineering, policy design, and safety, ensuring that AI\\-driven workflows are accurate, compliant, and user\\-friendly.
 



 You will use your API/JSON literacy, SQL basics, policy creation skills, and strong critical reasoning to review, refine, and design prompts and behaviors for AI systems interacting with products like Slack, PayPal, and other third\\-party tools. This role also requires strong communication skills and awareness of safety and content filtering, especially across a wide range of languages and locales.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day life look like?** 



* Design, review, and refine prompts and instructions for AI systems interacting with tools, APIs, and external services.
* Read and understand API/JSON schemas and arguments to ensure correct parameter usage and tool behavior.
* Apply SQL basics to validate data, perform simple checks, and support analysis of AI or tool behavior.
* Create, document, and maintain policies and guidelines governing AI interactions, content handling, and tool workflows.
* Develop workflow knowledge for specific tools (e.g., Slack, PayPal and similar platforms) and encode that into prompts and policies.
* Ensure safety and compliance by applying content filtering guidelines and detecting unsafe or non\\-compliant outputs.
* Evaluate AI responses for critical reasoning quality, correctness of parameters, and adherence to policies.
* Support multilingual use cases by validating prompts and responses across multiple locales, with attention to nuance and clarity.
* Collaborate with product, engineering, and safety teams to iterate on prompts, policies, and workflows based on evaluation findings.
* Document edge cases, decision rationales, and recommendations with clear, concise written communication.



  





**Requirements:** 



* **3–6 years of experience in any combination of:** 
 AI operations, content review, QA, product operations, policy, or technical support roles.
* **Strong API / JSON literacy:** 
 ability to read schemas, understand arguments, and verify correct parameter usage.

 ability to run simple queries to validate data, investigate issues, or support analysis.
* Demonstrated experience with prompt engineering or writing clear, structured instructions for AI or automation systems.
* **Proven policy creation skills:** 
 drafting, interpreting, and applying guidelines or policies in an operational setting.
* Familiarity with tool\\-specific workflows (e.g., Slack, PayPal, or similar SaaS platforms), including typical user actions and edge cases.
* Strong communication skills, with the ability to write clear, concise rationales and explanations; comfort working with multilingual contexts across many locales.
* High safety awareness for content filtering, including sensitivity to harmful, abusive, or policy\\-violating content.
* Excellent critical reasoning and judgment, especially when evaluating ambiguous or complex cases.
* Strong attention to detail, particularly in checking parameters, arguments, and compliance with specified schemas or policies.

**Role Overview:** 




 We are seeking an AI Prompt \\& Policy Specialist to help design, evaluate, and improve how AI systems interact with tools, APIs, and users across multiple locales. In this role, you will work at the intersection of prompt engineering, policy design, and safety, ensuring that AI\\-driven workflows are accurate, compliant, and user\\-friendly.
 



 You will use your API/JSON literacy, SQL basics, policy creation skills, and strong critical reasoning to review, refine, and design prompts and behaviors for AI systems interacting with products like Slack, PayPal, and other third\\-party tools. This role also requires strong communication skills and awareness of safety and content filtering, especially across a wide range of languages and locales.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day life look like?** 



* Design, review, and refine prompts and instructions for AI systems interacting with tools, APIs, and external services.
* Read and understand API/JSON schemas and arguments to ensure correct parameter usage and tool behavior.
* Apply SQL basics to validate data, perform simple checks, and support analysis of AI or tool behavior.
* Create, document, and maintain policies and guidelines governing AI interactions, content handling, and tool workflows.
* Develop workflow knowledge for specific tools (e.g., Slack, PayPal and similar platforms) and encode that into prompts and policies.
* Ensure safety and compliance by applying content filtering guidelines and detecting unsafe or non\\-compliant outputs.
* Evaluate AI responses for critical reasoning quality, correctness of parameters, and adherence to policies.
* Support multilingual use cases by validating prompts and responses across multiple locales, with attention to nuance and clarity.
* Collaborate with product, engineering, and safety teams to iterate on prompts, policies, and workflows based on evaluation findings.
* Document edge cases, decision rationales, and recommendations with clear, concise written communication.



  





**Requirements:** 



* **3–6 years of experience in any combination of:** 
 AI operations, content review, QA, product operations, policy, or technical support roles.
* **Strong API / JSON literacy:** 
 ability to read schemas, understand arguments, and verify correct parameter usage.
* **SQL basics:** 
 ability to run simple queries to validate data, investigate issues, or support analysis.
* Demonstrated experience with prompt engineering or writing clear, structured instructions for AI or automation systems.
* **Proven policy creation skills:** 
 drafting, interpreting, and applying guidelines or policies in an operational setting.
* Familiarity with tool\\-specific workflows (e.g., Slack, PayPal, or similar SaaS platforms), including typical user actions and edge cases.
* Strong communication skills, with the ability to write clear, concise rationales and explanations; comfort working with multilingual contexts across many locales.
* High safety awareness for content filtering, including sensitivity to harmful, abusive, or policy\\-violating content.
* Excellent critical reasoning and judgment, especially when evaluating ambiguous or complex cases.
* Strong attention to detail, particularly in checking parameters, arguments, and compliance with specified schemas or policies.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing:** 



* Work in a fully remote environment.
* Opportunity to work on cutting\\-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.



  





**Offer Details:** 



* **Commitments Required:**
