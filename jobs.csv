 : At TheHireHub.AI, we’re redefining recruitment with an end\\-to\\-end autopilot platform for hiring lifecycle management. Built on insights from 3,000\\+ real\\-world projects and powered by advanced AI, we automate sourcing, outreach, assessment, scheduling, and engagement—freeing hiring teams to focus on what matters most: human intuition.
 



  





**Role Overview** 
 : We are looking for a hands\\-on AI Engineer who can also wear the Engineering Lead hat. You will design, build, and productionize AI features end\\-to\\-end—spanning data, models, evaluation, and UX—while leading a small, high‑leverage engineering squad. The role blends \\~60–70% individual contribution with \\~30–40% technical leadership.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities:** 



* Ship Flask\\-based AI services: design, implement, and maintain Flask APIs for LLM/agent features (auth, rate‑limits, request/response schemas) with logging, tracing, and error handling.
* Integrate with React experiences: define clear API contracts and collaborate with React devs; build/own a lightweight internal demo UI when needed to validate UX.
* Build agentic workflows end\\-to\\-end: tool/function calling, planning/memory, guardrails; wire agents to recruiting use cases (sourcing, outreach personalization, scheduling, knowledge retrieval).
* Operate RAG as a product surface: own chunking policies, embeddings, vector/hybrid search, and freshness pipelines; monitor retrieval quality and data drift.
* Deliver on cost \\& latency SLOs: set budgets/targets; optimize via model routing (SLM vs FM), quantization, caching, batching; track p50/p95 latency and cost per task.
* Evaluation \\& safety by default: curate prompt \\+ dataset repos, offline/online evals (task success, hallucination, bias), red‑team critical paths; maintain dashboards and alerts.
* Lightweight MLOps \\& releases: manage model/artifact versions (simple registry), canary/A‑B rollouts, and rollbacks; automate with CI/CD.
* Security \\& PII ownership: implement least‑privilege access, masking, and audit trails; ensure tenancy isolation and SOC2‑oriented readiness.
* Lead a small squad: set technical direction, break down work, review PRs, mentor ICs, and collaborate with Product/Design/Customer teams to hit outcomes.



  





**Tech Stack You’ll Work With:** 



* Languages: Python and Flask and React
* AI/ML: PyTorch/JAX, foundation models (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google)
* Agents \\& RAG: tool/function calling, vector databases (Pinecone/Weaviate/PGVector/FAISS).



  





**Required Skills \\& Qualifications:** 



* 3\\+ years in software engineering with 6 months to 1 year experience in building ML/LLM‑powered products in production.
* Strong Python and Flask
* Hands‑on experience with agentic workflows (tool use, planning, memory) and Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) at scale.
* Demonstrated work with small/compact LLMs (fine‑tuning, quantization, distillation) and routing between foundation models and SLMs.
* Ability to design evaluation frameworks and ship safe, reliable AI systems with measurable outcomes.
* Solid systems and infra fundamentals: APIs, queues, data modeling, profiling, CI/CD, and cloud basics.
* Experience leading projects or a small team (tech lead, mentor, or manager‑of‑ICs).



  





**Nice\\-to\\-Have:** 



* HRTech/ATS/CRM experience or handling sensitive PII datasets.
* GPU inference optimization (KV‑cache, paged attention, tensor parallel), Triton kernels, or custom CUDA.
* Search/retrieval systems (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, Vespa, Milvus) and hybrid retrieval expertise.
* Frontend familiarity (React/Next.js) for rapid prototyping with Design.
* Security, privacy, and compliance exposure (SOC2, ISO 27001\\).



  





**Education:** 




 Bachelor’s degree in computer science, Engineering, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).
 



  





**What Success Looks Like (30/60/90\\):** 



* 30 days: Ship a scoped AI feature improvement (e.g., retrieval quality or latency win); map the AI surface area and propose a technical roadmap.
* 60 days: Lead a squad to productionize an agentic workflow with measurable wins (conversion, time‑to‑fill, or support deflection).
* 90 days: Establish an AI evaluation \\& observability stack (dashboards, alerts, experiment tracking) and a repeatable release process.



  





**What We Offer:** 



* Be part of a dynamic and forward\\-thinking executive search firm that fosters collaboration, growth, and continuous learning.
* Work closely with top\\-tier organizations, providing strategic talent solutions and gaining deep insights into leadership hiring and talent management.
* Enjoy a rewarding package that reflects your expertise and contribution, along with comprehensive benefits to support your well\\-being.
* Access best\\-in\\-class tools, technologies, and methodologies that are shaping the future of executive search, empowering you to deliver exceptional results for clients.","Technology, Information and Internet and Staffing and Recruiting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/thehirehub-ai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQG1cXp05dEJZQ/company-logo_100_100/B56Zfkfxi3HQAQ-/0/1751885224760?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=HaGlDe-Dg8VooeST8Rsyfn4UGG8b8AvyjmfO2CrsCwo","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our 10 offices across the United States and India — plus numerous remote employees — all work to modernize the healthcare experience, together.

We continue to expand our workforce with amazing people who bring diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives at every level, and foster an environment where every athenista feels comfortable bringing their best selves to work.
