Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.
   

  

 We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that.

 The Growth Engineering team is responsible for building world\\-class experiences that help the millions of Cloudflare self\\-service customers get what they need faster, from acquisition and onboarding all the way through to adoption and scale up. Our team is focused on high velocity experimentation and thoughtful optimizations to that experience on Cloudflare’s properties.
   

  

 This team has a dual mandate, also focusing on evolving our current marketing attribution, customer event ingress and experimentation capabilities that process billions of events across those properties to drive data\\-driven decision making.
   

  

 As an engineer for the team responsible for Data Capture and Experimentation, your job will be to deliver on those growth\\-driven features and experiences while evolving our current marketing attribution, consumer event ingress and experimentation setup across these experiences, and partner with many teams on implementations.

 We are looking for experienced full\\-stack engineers to join the Experimentation and Data Capture team. The ideal candidate will have experience working with large\\-scale applications, familiarity with event\\-driven data capture, and strong understanding of system design. You must care deeply not only about the quality of your and the team's code, but also the customer experience and developer experience. We have a great opportunity to evolve our current data capture and experimentation systems to better serve our customers.
   

  

 We are also strong believers in dog\\-fooding our own products. From cache configuration to Cloudflare Access, Cloudflare Workers, and Zaraz, these are all tools in our engineer's tool belt, so it is a plus if you have been a customer of ours, even as a free user.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
 The Experimentation and Data Capture Engineering Team will be responsible for the following:

* Inspire and mentor less experienced engineers
* Work closely with the trust and safety team to handle any compliance or data privacy\\-related matters


**Examples Of Desirable Skills, Knowledge And Experience**
* Comfort with building reusable SDKs and UI components with TypeScript/JavaScript required, comfort/familiarity with other languages (Go/Rust/Python) a plus.
* Experience building with high\\-scale serverless systems like Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, etc.
* Design and execute A/B tests and experiments to optimize for business KPIs, including user onboarding, feature adoption, and overall product experience. Create reusable components for other developers to leverage.
* Experience with publishing\\-to and querying\\-from data lake/warehouse products like Clickhouse, Apache Iceberg, to evaluate experiments. Familiarity with commercial analytics systems (Adobe Analytics, Google BigQuery, etc) a plus.
* Implement tracking and attribution systems to understand user behavior and measure the effectiveness of growth initiatives.
* Familiarity with event driven architectures, high\\-scale data processing, issues that can occur and how to protect against them.
* Familiarity with global data privacy requirements governed by laws like GDPR/CCPA/etc, and the implications for data capture, modeling, and analysis.
* Desire to work in a very fast\\-paced environment.


**What Makes Cloudflare Special?**
 We’re not just a highly ambitious, large\\-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large\\-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.
   

  

**Project Galileo** 
 : Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers\\-\\-at no cost.
   

  

**Athenian Project** 
 : In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.
   

  

**1\\.1\\.1\\.1** 
 : We released 1\\.1\\.1\\.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy\\-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use \\- it is the first consumer\\-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal \\- we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
