With assets valued over USD $7 trillion managed on Aladdin, our technology empowers millions of investors to save for retirement, pay for college, buy a home and improve their financial wellbeing.
   

  

 Studio is the primary Aladdin interface for BlackRock clients to explore, subscribe and build solutions using the API and Data libraries BlackRock provides. The core studio team is responsible for building an integration platform for different Aladdin products and solutions and client integration frameworks to come together in a seamless, cohesive and intuitive user journey.
