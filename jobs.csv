 This is not a “job opening” in the usual sense. I’m looking for a builder who wants to take responsibility for something meaningful and grow it from zero to real scale. If you’re excited by that kind of chaos (the good kind), keep reading.
 



  





**What we're building:** 





 Superlink is a creator commerce platform that helps brands turn influencer marketing into a measurable, performance channel \\- and helps
 

 creators create better content \\& monetise more through brand deals.
 





 We’re early,
 

 Things will be messy,
 

 moving fast, and focused on building things that matters — not chasing vanity features.
 




  





**Who's this for:** 



* You think in terms of outcomes, not tasks.
* You’re comfortable making decisions without perfect information.
* You take pride in building things that work reliably, not just look good in demos.
* You communicate clearly and don’t hide behind jargon.
* You don’t need hand\\-holding — you figure things out and ask the right questions when needed.
* You want to build something long\\-term, not just “work on a startup”.



  





**What you'll actually need to be good at (tech wise):** 



* Strong hands\\-on experience building real web products used by real users.
* Backend\\-first or full\\-stack experience with:
* Node.js \\+ TypeScript
* Relational databases (Postgres preferred and supabase knowledge).
* REST APIs, webhooks, background jobs, and basic system design.
* Familiar with tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Figma, Supabase, Deployment Servers.
* Frontend comfort with Next.js (you don’t need to be a design wizard, but you should ship usable UIs).
* Experience integrating third\\-party APIs (auth, payments, social platforms, tools).
* Ability to take a feature from idea → production → iteration without passing the buck.



  





 No college degree required. No fancy titles required. If you’ve built serious things on your own, shipped products, or learned the hard way — that counts.
 



  





**What we expect from a Founding Engineer(CTO):** 



* Ownership of core product systems.
* Clear thinking when things break (because they will).
* Bias toward simple, maintainable solutions.
* Willingness to improve things that already exist, not just build new ones.
* Help set the technical foundation for future engineers.



  





**How to apply:** 




 Please email or message with:
 


1. A short introduction about yourself and why Superlink interests you.
2. Links to projects, products, or repositories that show what you’ve built (production work preferred).
3. A brief note on what kind of problems you enjoy solving.



  





 We’ll start with a focused technical conversation, followed by a founder alignment discussion.
 



  





**If I’m being blunt:** 




**If you want a safe, well\\-defined role — this isn’t it.** 




**If you want to help shape a product, a company, and your own trajectory — this might be worth your time.**","Software Development","https://in.linkedin.com/company/getsuperlink","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQESbGn7gZJETg/company-logo_100_100/B56ZtkxI0RHsAQ-/0/1766922162174?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=3kES9uo_VSGKzRR4My4608Esp9D3m39ZeVjpczY5xKA","","","","","","","","","","",""
