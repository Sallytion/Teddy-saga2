 ‼️ Hi there, we recognize that all too often, potential candidates don’t apply for a position simply because they don’t hit every single criteria included in the job description—particularly members of underrepresented groups.
 



  





 Whether or not your experience ✅ checks off all the boxes on a job posting, we still encourage you to apply to ensure that your application receives a review from our team. We understand that a resume can only showcase so much during the applicant stage, so we've created prompts in the application for you to share more about yourself.

**Role Overview**
 The Lead Physical Design Engineer is role which combines deep hands\\-on implementation expertise with technical leadership. This role owns complex block\\- and/or top\\-level physical design for advanced\\-node SoCs and leads a small group of engineers to achieve high\\-quality, on\\-time delivery.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
**Technical Ownership**
 Own end\\-to\\-end physical implementation (floorplanning, power planning, placement, CTS, routing, ECO) for complex blocks or subsystems across advanced technology nodes (e.g., 22nm, 16nm, 7nm, 5nm, 4nm).
   

  

 Drive timing closure, congestion resolution, IR/EM, signal integrity, and physical verification (DRC/LVS/antenna) to meet PPA and quality targets.
   

  

 Define and refine hierarchical PNR strategies, IO ring/PG structures, and integration guidelines for large SoCs.
   

  

 Perform in\\-depth analysis and debug of tool issues, timing failures, and physical design anomalies; propose robust, scalable solutions.
   

  

**Methodology and Automation**
 Develop, maintain, and enhance physical design methodologies, scripts, and flows (e.g., for PDN, PG, clock structure, exception handling, signoff automation).
   

  

 Proactively identify opportunities for flow improvements and standardization to reduce turnaround time and error rates.
   

  

 Evaluate EDA tool features and drive best practices in collaboration with CAD/enablement teams.
   

  

**Technical Leadership \\& Team Enablement**
 Provide technical direction to a small group of physical design engineers, including task breakdown, priority setting, and quality expectations.
   

  

 Mentor junior engineers and NCGs in PNR, STA and debug practices to build a strong second tier of technical capability.
   

  

 Review floorplans, constraints, and implementation choices from team members, giving clear, actionable feedback.
   

  

 Act as a go\\-to technical reference within the PD team.
   

  

**Cross\\-Functional Collaboration**
 Work closely with RTL design, STA, DFT, CAD, and packaging teams to converge on implementation\\-friendly architectures and constraints.
   

  

 Communicate risks, options, and trade\\-offs clearly to project leads and managers, and help shape mitigation plans.
   

  

 Participate in design reviews and signoff reviews, representing physical design status, risks, and recommendations.
   

  

**Required Qualifications**
 Strong experience in physical design implementation for complex digital SoCs, typically 8–12\\+ years in physical design or equivalent level of mastery.
