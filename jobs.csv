Our mission is to provide Bloomberg developers with a standard, scalable, managed and compliant platform experience.
   

  

**About The Teams**
*DataLayer Platform*
 DataLayer is the high\\-performance library used to build reactive transformations of data in the Bloomberg Terminal. From simple sorting and filtering, to complex multi\\-level aggregations and the Excel\\-like expression evaluation engine, Datalayer is the engine that powers almost every grid or table of data in the Bloomberg Terminal.
   

  

 The newly created DataLayer Platform team in Pune will take ownership of embedding the DataLayer into Bloomberg runtimes, providing seamless integration with the Bloomberg Terminal and backend services. This will require the team to work closely with other DataLayer teams as well as multiple infrastructure teams to ensure that DataLayer works as efficiently and performant as possible in those runtimes.

We provide a stable, fault\\-tolerant, scalable architecture with flexible routing rules and support for enterprise security and monitoring capabilities used by over 9,000 Bloomberg software engineers.
   

  

 The team in Pune works closely with teams in New York and London on developing solutions and tools for service schema and lifecycle management. The focus is on streamlining and automating various aspects of the lifecycle of a service \\- its creation, contract definition, configuration, deployment and retirement \\- enforcing safeguards and best practices for overall system stability.
   

  

 We’ll trust you to
   

  

* Have an eye for detail and an interest in working on the complex challenges of large\\-scale distributed systems.
* Bring a strong understanding of working with highly multi\\-threaded and asynchronous programming environments

**The Longer Story**
 OutSystems enables enterprise teams to build AI\\-powered applications and agents that reduce manual work, streamline internal operations, and accelerate impact. A proven low\\-code foundation combined with agentic AI and AI app generation capabilities empowers teams to move up to 10x faster with the assurance of security, scalability, and governance built in.
   

  

 As the future becomes agentic, our customers need us now more than ever. AI has opened the door to extraordinary possibilities—but inside the enterprise, things are moving fast and feeling chaotic. Some early adopters are making progress in production, but for many, AI tools are sprawling without governance, data isn’t ready, and talent isn’t there yet. Enterprises are still drowning in application backlogs and struggling with legacy systems. But with the right platform, AI doesn’t have to add to the chaos. It can become the breakthrough that brings clarity—and drives real, enterprise\\-wide impact. At OutSystems, we’ve built that platform, providing the tools necessary for enterprises to overcome these hurdles.
   

  

 We are looking for passionate, talented, and motivated people to join us in helping our customers build, deploy, and scale apps and agents—fast, helping them accelerate innovation while enabling secure, governed human\\-AI collaboration.
   

  

 OutSystems is a truly global company, with more than 850,000 developer community members, 1,700 employees, more than 500 partners, and thousands of active customers in over 75 countries and across 21 industries. Founded in 2001, OutSystems has offices in the United States, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal, Germany, the UAE, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Singapore, and of course has a thriving, worldwide community of remote employees.
   

  

 Amongst our 2,400 customers are some of the world's most recognizable brands across diverse industries—brands like Toyota, Heineken, Bosch, KeyBank, and UCLA. These customers are the reason we have a 4\\.6 star rating on G2\\. Their success is ours, and their stories demonstrate tangible ROI and transformational impact. We are a 9x Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader for Low\\-Code Application Platforms and a multi\\-year leader in the Forrester Wave. We’re recognized not just as leaders but as visionaries with a strong ability to execute, now extending our leadership into the AI and agentic application development arena.
   

  

**Working at OutSystems**
 Our goal is to ensure that OutSystems is a place for bright, happy, and motivated people who share a common purpose and take pride in doing excellent work to pursue our vision of providing the AI\\-powered low\\-code development platform enterprise leaders trust to build, secure, and evolve their business applications, agents, and core systems.
