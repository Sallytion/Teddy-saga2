 Learn more about us here!
   

  

****This is a 100% remote position.****
**About Your New Role**
 We’re looking for a Staff Software Engineer to lead the modernization of CommandLink’s billing, license management, and financial systems—the backbone of our fast\\-growing SaaS enterprise. This isn’t about incremental feature work. It’s about transforming a legacy, monolithic PHP environment into a resilient, service\\-oriented architecture that powers accurate billing, license enforcement, accounting, and historical financial reporting—at scale, without disrupting the business.
   

  

 You’ll set the technical direction, architect migration strategies, and lead engineering execution to ensure we deliver a modern, global\\-ready financial platform that’s bulletproof in accuracy, compliance, and scalability. Your work directly impacts revenue operations, customer trust, and the speed at which we can innovate. Billing, licensing, and accounting aren’t back\\-office functions—they
 **are**
 the system of record for how value flows through our business. Getting this right means we can scale confidently, innovate faster, and maintain absolute trust with customers and partners.
   

  

 If you want to own the modernization of a critical financial platform at a company already at massive scale and still growing fast—this is the role.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Architect the Future State: Design a modular, service\\-driven financial platform—billing, license management, and accounting—that can evolve with the business.
* Lead Legacy\\-to\\-Modern Migration: Define and execute pragmatic migration strategies that move us from a fragile monolith to a modern stack—without breaking existing operations.
* Build Scalable Billing Services: Own the architecture for invoicing, payments, reconciliations, and revenue recognition that must be precise, reliable, and auditable.
* Integrate with Global Financial Systems: Architect integrations with ERP, payment gateways, and accounting platforms (NetSuite, QuickBooks, Stripe, Zuora, Chargebee, etc.).
* Guarantee Data Integrity: Engineer for consistency, reconciliation, and historical accuracy across complex transactional systems.
* Set Standards: Drive observability, performance, and security across all financial services.
* Cross\\-Functional Leadership: Work directly with Finance, Product, and Operations to ensure technology aligns with compliance, business velocity, and customer impact.


**What You'll Need For Success**
* Deep Engineering Experience: 10\\+ years building and scaling backend systems with strong fundamentals in transactional integrity, distributed systems, and service architectures.
* Proven Modernization Track Record: Hands\\-on experience decomposing legacy systems (especially PHP\\-based) into modern service platforms.
* Integration Mastery: Strong history integrating with ERP, accounting, and payment systems (NetSuite expertise highly valued).
* Architect at Scale: Skilled at building high\\-volume, high\\-accuracy financial systems with global reach.
* Security \\& Compliance: Solid knowledge of PCI, SOC2, GDPR, authentication protocols (OAuth 2\\.0, HMAC, mTLS), and data handling best practices.
* Cloud\\-Native Mindset: Experience architecting and deploying in Azure (preferred), AWS, or GCP.
* Leadership Without Bureaucracy: Able to guide teams, influence executives, and align cross\\-functional priorities without slowing execution.
