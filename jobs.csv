 MAIT is an AI\\-native intelligence platform for technology procurement and contract management.
 



  





 Built on years of advisory work across complex IT supplier landscapes, MAIT codifies benchmarking, contract intelligence, and negotiation expertise into a scalable platform.
 



  





 The platform is currently in structured Beta, with early proof\\-of\\-value demonstrated across large enterprise IT spend portfolios. We are now focused on operationalising and scaling this foundation through a small number of focused Client Design Partnerships.
 



  





 Founder based in Amsterdam; core product and engineering team being built in Gurgaon.
 



  





**The Mission:** 




 Build the engineering foundations that transform a strong Beta product into a secure, reliable, and repeatable enterprise\\-grade platform.
 



  





 Lead the first AI \\& Platform pod in Gurgaon and establish the delivery discipline, architectural standards, and security culture required to scale MAIT into broader enterprise deployments.
 



  





 This is a hands\\-on leadership role with significant ownership and room to grow as the engineering function expands.
 



  





**What You'll Own:** 




 You will own engineering discipline \\& architectural integrity that makes MAIT dependable.
 



**1\\) Delivery \\& Execution:** 



* Lead a pod of 2–6 engineers (growing over time).
* Translate roadmap into well\\-scoped, measurable increments.
* Establish clear sprint ownership and weekly shipment rhythm.
* Improve predictability: planned vs shipped.



**2\\) Reliability \\& Quality:** 



* Strengthen CI/CD, testing strategy, and release hygiene.
* Raise code review standards and definition of done.
* Reduce regressions through disciplined quality gates.
* Improve observability (logs, metrics, traces, alerting, incident response).
* Implement feature flags, controlled rollouts, and rollback readiness.



**3\\) AI Engineering Discipline:** 



* Build structured, repeatable AI workflows (schemas, validation, fallbacks).
* Establish evaluation harnesses (golden sets \\+ regression checks).
* Version prompts/models/pipelines with transparency on changes.
* Define clear boundaries between deterministic and probabilistic logic.



**4\\) Architecture \\& Security Foundations:** 



* Design scalable system architecture for document\\-heavy, AI\\-assisted workflows.
* Own secure\\-by\\-design principles across data handling, access control, and enterprise\\-grade safeguards.
* Ensure auditability and traceability (outputs linked to evidence and source).
* Enforce architectural discipline as the system evolves.



  





**What Success Looks Like:** 




**First 30 Days:** 



* Establish delivery cadence and ownership clarity.
* Tighten code review discipline and definition of done.
* Improve release hygiene and operational visibility.



**First 60 Days:** 



* Predictable weekly releases.
* Reduced regressions through stronger testing coverage.
* Initial AI evaluation harness in place for critical workflows.



**First 90 Days:** 



* Higher\\-confidence releases with fewer incidents.
* More structured, traceable AI\\-assisted workflows.
* Strengthened foundations for enterprise\\-scale deployment.



  





**Must\\-Have Profile:** 



* 7–12 years building and operating production software.
* Hands\\-on engineer: active in code and code reviews.
* Led a small engineering pod with delivery accountability.
* Experience designing scalable system architecture.
* Strong engineering discipline: CI/CD, testing strategy, release practices, observability.
* Solid understanding of secure software design principles (auth, access control, data protection).
* Experience shipping SaaS products in real customer environments.
* Comfortable in early\\-stage / scale\\-up environments: evolving scope, high ownership, ambiguity.



  





**Strong Advantages:** 



* AI product engineering experience (LLMs, RAG, eval harnesses).
* Experience with document\\-heavy systems (extraction, search, provenance).
* Enterprise SaaS exposure (RBAC, audit logs, SSO, multi\\-tenancy).
* Startup or early\\-stage scale experience.



  





**The Leadership Traits We Value:** 



* Product\\-minded and systems\\-thinking.
* Comfortable saying “no” when discipline demands it.
* Able to push back constructively — including with founders.
* Focused on long\\-term architecture, not just short\\-term velocity.
* Motivated by building foundations that scale.



  





**Growth Opportunity:** 




 This role begins as Engineering Manager \\- AI \\& Platform, leading the first core pod in Gurgaon.
 



  





 As MAIT scales beyond Beta and expands its engineering function, there is clear scope to grow into broader engineering leadership responsibilities.
 



  





 We are looking for someone who wants to build the foundation, and grow with it.
 



  





**Compensation:** 




 ₹35L \\- ₹50L CTC
 



 Meaningful ESOP allocation aligned to long\\-term scale goals.
 



  





**Why Join Now?** 



* Early\\-stage ownership with real architectural influence.
* Enterprise\\-grade AI challenges (not experimental prototypes).
* Direct access to founder and product strategy.
* Opportunity to shape engineering culture from day one.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://nl.linkedin.com/company/multistrat","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEFBARhYu0gTA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1726137558919/multistrat_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=hfoR5t0gIVPEJyfhdPnevnAdfYbFisA41Trl9LTwN8M","","","","","","","","","","",""

 The Endpoint Engineering Services team manages all the client endpoints and Thin Clients across our enterprise: Windows and Apple desktops, laptops, iPhones, and iPads. We are responsible for ensuring that endpoints and their software are up to date with the latest approved OS version, patched, application delivery is maintained, and overall health is maintained. We ensure a seamless experience for caregivers through a centralized tool that automates many of these transactions.
   

  

**What is this position all about?**
 We are seeking a hands\\-on IGEL Platform Engineer to design, implement, and operate secure, scalable, and highly available end\\-user compute (EUC) solutions using
 **IGEL OS** 
 ,
 **IGEL Universal Management Suite (UMS)** 
 , and
 **IGEL Cloud Gateway (ICG)** 
 . The role partners closely with EUC, VDI, Security, and Network teams to deliver seamless access to virtual desktops and apps (Citrix, VMware Horizon, Azure Virtual Desktop) while driving automation, policy governance, and proactive service reliability.
   

  

 The Lead Enterprise IGEL Administrator will work independently with other Information Services (IS) professionals (e.g. Operational, Engineering, Architecture, and Application teams) to ensure the IGEL environment is optimized for the delivery of clinical and business services in support of the IS Strategic Plan. This requires close collaboration with clinical and non\\-clinical caregivers, project managers, and other IS professionals to enumerate requirements from various stakeholders. The Lead Enterprise IGEL Administrator will use their expert knowledge of IGEL/Citrix/Thin Clients/VDI to determine the optimal configuration of the IGEL environment and configure it accordingly. They will also author new or modify existing documentation related to IGEL and serve as an in\\-house operational escalation point for troubleshooting complex issues and developing and implementing solutions.
   

  

**What will you be responsible for?**
* Design and deploy IGEL OS–based endpoints at scale across sites and remote users using UMS and ICG for internet\\-managed devices.
* Define golden images, profiles, firmware customizations (Custom Partitions), and layered configurations for different personas/use cases.
* Integrate IGEL with Citrix DaaS/CVAD, VMware Horizon, and/or Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) including protocol tuning (ICA/HDX, Blast, PCoIP, RDP), peripherals, and multimedia redirection.
* Implement HA/DR patterns for UMS (Load balancer, HA pairs), secure backups, and certificate lifecycle management (TLS, client certs, SCEP).
* Own day‑to‑day operations: firmware lifecycle (pilot → ringed rollout), profile governance, endpoint posture, and incident/problem management (ITIL).
* Build automation for configuration, assignments, and compliance reporting (e.g., UMS REST API, PowerShell, bash, Python).
* Maintain logging and observability (UMS logs, syslog, event correlation) and drive SLO/SLI dashboards for uptime, performance, and user experience.
* Manage peripheral enablement (printers, scanners, headsets, webcams, smartcards/HID) and USB policies.
* Ensure Zero Trust aligned configurations—secure boot, read‑only OS, MFA/SSO (SAML/OIDC), and conditional access integrations (e.g., with IdP).
* Enforce device hardening, secure Wi‑Fi/VPN profiles, proxy settings, and locked‑down kiosk modes where needed.
* Coordinate with InfoSec for vulnerability management, pen‑test remediation, and audit readiness (SOX/ISO27001\\).
* Create and maintain SOPs, runbooks, and RACI aligned with change, release, and problem management processes.
* Act as SME for IGEL in architecture reviews, change advisory boards, and major incident bridges.
* Partner with VDI/EUC teams to optimize session launch times, protocol QoS, and client\\-side policies.
* Deliver training, knowledge transfers, and clear documentation for support tiers.


**Who are we looking for?**
* Experience: 6–8 years in EUC/VDI engineering with at least 3\\+ years hands‑on IGEL (IGEL OS, UMS, ICG) in enterprise scale (50,000\\+ endpoints).
* Platforms: Strong with Citrix (DaaS/CVAD), VMware Horizon, and/or Azure Virtual Desktop client\\-side integration and optimization.
* Scripting/Automation: PowerShell, bash (and/or Python) for UMS API usage, configuration\\-as\\-code, and reporting.
* Operations: Proven track record with firmware lifecycle, ringed deployments, HA/DR for UMS, and structured change management (ITIL).
* Troubleshooting: Advanced log analysis (UMS, client logs), protocol trace basics (Wireshark), and performance tuning.","Hospitals and Health Care","https://in.linkedin.com/company/providenceindia","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQEK4ciwWsm--w/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630520006773/providence_india_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=_MRfQhAqkPSMSagbnpMq0tLjK9LQJtUNCvOpoomYKgA","","","","","","","","","","",""
