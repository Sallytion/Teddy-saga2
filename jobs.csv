* Design, build, and maintain end\\-to\\-end automated test frameworks using Playwright, Cypress, or similar modern automation frameworks.
* Write and maintain UI, API, integration, and workflow\\-level automated tests that validate real customer scenarios.

* Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring fast, reliable feedback for every change.
* Reduce flaky tests, long execution times, and false failures that erode trust in automation.
* Identify high\\-risk system areas (integration boundaries, asynchronous workflows, data transformations) and define targeted test strategies.
* Investigate test failures and escaped defects, perform root cause analysis, and drive durable fixes.
* Define and promote testing standards, automation best practices, and quality strategies across teams.


**What You Bring**
* 7\\+ years of experience as an SDET, Software Engineer in Test, or Software Engineer with significant test automation ownership.
* Strong proficiency in TypeScript and/or JavaScript.
* Hands\\-on experience with modern test automation frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium\\-based frameworks, or similar).
* Experience testing APIs, distributed systems, and asynchronous workflows.
* Experience integrating test suites into CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or similar).
* Ability to read and reason about production code to design effective and maintainable tests.
* Strong debugging, analytical, and problem\\-solving skills.
* Clear communication skills and the ability to influence quality outcomes without formal authority.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience with integration platforms, data pipelines, or workflow\\-driven systems.
* Familiarity with cloud\\-native architectures and containerized environments.
* Exposure to performance, reliability, or resilience testing.
* Experience supporting enterprise or B2B products with complex configurations and long\\-lived customers.


**Why Join US**
* Work on mission\\-critical systems used by utilities and public\\-sector organizations.
* Solve complex, real\\-world integration problems where quality genuinely matters.
* Operate in an engineering culture that values ownership, pragmatism, and outcomes over process.
* Influence how quality is designed into the system—not just tested after the fact.

These automations vary from NLP to extract dates from documents, using elastic search to match separate data sources together, or building time based schedules from multiple data sources. Since there are a lot of variables, edge cases, and complex domain knowledge, we heavily rely on automated testing.

 Django, Celery, Postgres, Docker, Terraform, AWS, Integrating 3rd party APIs, building APIs, Unit \\& Integration testing.
   

  

**We''''''''re Looking For Someone Who Has An End\\-to\\-end Mindset.**
* You can take ownership of a task, propose a solution and plan, involve the right parties, ask the right questions, and can deliver independently if necessary.
* Preferably you''''''''re someone that understands no one person knows everything, and is willing to learn, but also explain and teach others.

These automations vary from NLP to extract dates from documents, using elastic search to match separate data sources together, or building time based schedules from multiple data sources. Since there are a lot of variables, edge cases, and complex domain knowledge, we heavily rely on automated testing.

**Software Development Company is Looking for:**
 Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)****
**About Us**
 We are an enterprise\\-grade integration platform provider for asset\\-intensive organizations, delivering mission\\-critical synchronization between
 **GIS** 
 and
 **Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)** 
 systems. Our cloud\\-native platform is designed to help utilities and infrastructure operators configure, operate, and monitor complex data integrations with confidence.
   

  

 We operate in a highly technical domain where correctness, clarity, and reliability matter. Our engineers work on real\\-world, mission\\-critical systems used by large utility companies and local government entities every day.
   

  

**The Role**
 We are looking for a
 **Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)** 
 to own
 **end to\\-end test automation and product quality** 
 across our platforms. This is a hands\\-on engineering role for someone who treats quality as a
 **system\\-level responsibility** 
 , not a phase at the end of delivery.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Design, build, and maintain end\\-to\\-end automated test frameworks using Playwright, Cypress, or similar modern automation frameworks.
* Write and maintain UI, API, integration, and workflow\\-level automated tests that validate real customer scenarios.
* Embed quality deeply into the development lifecycle by partnering closely with software engineers and product teams.
* Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring fast, reliable feedback for every change.
* Reduce flaky tests, long execution times, and false failures that erode trust in automation.
* Identify high\\-risk system areas (integration boundaries, asynchronous workflows, data transformations) and define targeted test strategies.
* Investigate test failures and escaped defects, perform root cause analysis, and drive durable fixes.
* Define and promote testing standards, automation best practices, and quality strategies across teams.


**What You Bring**
* 7\\+ years of experience as an SDET, Software Engineer in Test, or Software Engineer with significant test automation ownership.
* Strong proficiency in TypeScript and/or JavaScript.
* Hands\\-on experience with modern test automation frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium\\-based frameworks, or similar).
* Experience testing APIs, distributed systems, and asynchronous workflows.
* Experience integrating test suites into CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or similar).
* Ability to read and reason about production code to design effective and maintainable tests.
* Strong debugging, analytical, and problem\\-solving skills.
* Clear communication skills and the ability to influence quality outcomes without formal authority.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience with integration platforms, data pipelines, or workflow\\-driven systems.
* Familiarity with cloud\\-native architectures and containerized environments.
* Exposure to performance, reliability, or resilience testing.
* Experience supporting enterprise or B2B products with complex configurations and long\\-lived customers.


**Why Join US**
* Work on mission\\-critical systems used by utilities and public\\-sector organizations.
* Solve complex, real\\-world integration problems where quality genuinely matters.
* Operate in an engineering culture that values ownership, pragmatism, and outcomes over process.
* Influence how quality is designed into the system—not just tested after the fact.


**How to apply for this opportunity?**
* Step 1: Click On Apply! And Register or Login on our portal.
* Step 2: Complete the Screening Form \\& Upload updated Resume
