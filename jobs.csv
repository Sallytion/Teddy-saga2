**Job Description**
 As a Software Development Engineer 3 you are in a senior Individual Contributor engineering role at Tesco. Your proficiency with foundational computer science and software engineering concepts is taken as a given; and you will have proven significant technical depth and breadth. At this level you will be playing an active role in technical leadership; with proven impact across teams and the wider directorate. You take ownership and accountability of the development of the products in your domain. You participate in activities that build capability across the organisation: coaching and mentoring of existing colleagues; and interviewing/hiring of new colleagues. Once you have reached the SDE3 level; progression will vary significantly; and is likely to include more lateral opportunities than vertical promotion. This is also the level of core technical knowledge you must reach before considering a sideways move to the management track.
   

 Following our Business Code of Conduct and always acting with integrity and due diligence and have these specific risk responsibilities:
   

 My impact reaches beyond my immediate team; and I provide perspective and context for technology choices across my directorate.

I build maturity in the way we develop; deliver and operate services. I ensure that we’re learning from the best in the industry; designing and implementing appropriate testing and deployment strategies. I can anticipate feature evolution of my product. I utilise this when facilitating design sessions to ensure that the system architecture evolves to support future requirements. I understand the wider Tesco architectural strategy and champion its application to the systems that I work on. At this level my job starts to become just as much about exercising technical judgment as it does about implementation. I am comfortable managing competing priorities and am able to bring order to ambiguous scenarios. I create optimal outcomes combining short\\-term and long\\-term goals; utilising data driven decision making techniques to take appropriate trade\\-offs. I can identify risks and proactively engage with product and programme managers. I am a strong communicator within my team and to my stakeholders. I am a trusted mentor; a role\\-model for more junior engineers. I am approachable and am frequently asked to mentor those around me. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across the directorate; both informally in 1:1 discussions and by arranging more formal training opportunities. I build capability and raise the bar by contributing to hiring and interviewing practices. I regularly participate in recruitment assessments. Externally I represent the best of Tesco Technology to attract new talent and encourage interest in our organisation.
