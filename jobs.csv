**About Us:** 




 We are building CrudReview (www.crudreview.com), a flagship initiative of DataDrone that makes reviews effortless.

The goal is simple: remove friction and help businesses strengthen their online reputation with ease. We operate in an early\\-stage, high\\-velocity environment with a small team and big ambition.
 



  





**Your Role:** 




 This is a ""raw engineering role"", not a “learning\\-only” internship.
 



 You will work directly with the core team to integrate features, solve real problems, and ship value.
 



  





 No fluff.
 



 No easy days.
 



 Only real work that makes the product better.

* Deliver meaningful contributions, not dummy academic tasks



  





**Who Should Apply:** 




 Only apply if:
 


* You’re a tech maniac who genuinely loves coding
* You’re comfortable figuring things out without spoon\\-feeding
* You learn fast and enjoy breaking down complex problems
* You can handle pressure, pace, and accountability
* You don’t try to “look good”, try to get things done



  





 If you aren’t wired this way, it won’t work for either of us.
 



 Don’t take a chance unless you’re truly obsessed with building.
 



  





**What You’ll Get:** 



* A team that supports you but doesn’t hand\\-hold
* An environment of doing, not passive learning
* Real exposure to engineering in a fast\\-moving SaaS product
* Recognition and rewards for exceptional contributors
* A strong certificate that will genuinely boost your professional journey
