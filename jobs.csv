Large‑scale language models are evolving from clever chatbots into powerful engines of scientific discovery. With high‑quality training data, tomorrow’s AI can democratize world‑class education, keep pace with cutting‑edge research, and streamline software development for engineers everywhere. That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI.
   

  

 We’re looking for JavaScript coding specialists who live and breathe algorithms, data structures, software architecture, frontend and backend development, cloud infrastructure, and systems programming—and who can do so fluently using JavaScript. You’ll challenge advanced language models on topics like asynchronous programming, RESTful API integration, memory management, object\\-oriented design, secure coding practices, and debugging distributed systems—documenting every failure mode so we can harden model reasoning.
   

  

 On a typical day, you will converse with the model on software engineering tasks and technical scenarios using JavaScript, verify logical accuracy and coding fluency, assess code quality and clarity, capture reproducible error traces, and suggest improvements to our prompt engineering and evaluation metrics.
   

  

 A bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD in computer science, software engineering, or a closely related technical field is ideal; real\\-world JavaScript experience, technical writing, or open\\-source contributions signal fit. Clear, metacognitive communication—“showing your work”—is essential.
   

  

 Ready to turn your JavaScript coding expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world.
   

  

 We offer a pay range of $8‑to‑$65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above. As a contractor you’ll supply a secure computer and high‑speed internet; company‑sponsored benefits such as health insurance and PTO do not apply.
