 We’re hiring a
 ***SDE\\-2 Frontend Engineer***
 to architect smooth, reliable, and high\\-performing interfaces in React.
   

  

 This isn’t a “code from Figma” role. You’ll own frontend architecture decisions, lead performance improvements, and help shape the future of how our users write, track, and optimize their cold emails. From reusable component libraries to debugging render bottlenecks this is a role for engineers who care about clarity, craft, and speed.
   

  

**Experience:** 
 3\\-4 Years
   

  

**Why Join Us?**
* Purpose: You’ll be building mission\\-critical UI used daily by power users across the globe and everything you ship directly impacts reply rates, engagement, and pipeline generation.
* Growth: This is a high\\-ownership role. You’ll contribute to architecture, performance, developer experience, and design system evolution and grow toward SDE\\-3 or Frontend Lead.
* Motivation: If you care about design fidelity, component composability, frontend performance, and delivering zero\\-jank experiences, this is your lane.


**Your Main Goals**
* Drive Component Architecture and Reusability (within 45 days) Build and ship a shared component library using our design system. Ensure type safety, accessibility, and flexibility across views. Goal: Replace at least 3 duplicated components in current screens with clean, reusable variants.

* Shape Frontend DX and Review Quality (within 90 days) Define best practices for code quality, styling, testing, and PR reviews. Guide junior devs and set examples. Target: Introduce 3 new DX improvements and act as reviewer on all key UI PRs.
* Collaborate Cross\\-Functionally to Shape Features (ongoing) Work with designers and backend engineers to scope, simplify, and validate UI/UX decisions early. Impact: Catch inconsistencies, UX traps, or perf overhead before they hit staging.


**Important Tasks**
* Build high\\-impact UI features like email composer, sequence planner, or engagement dashboard
* Profile and fix React render bottlenecks using flamegraphs and why\\-did\\-you\\-render
* Introduce or refine testing via React Testing Library or Playwright
* Translate unstructured design ideas into structured, componentized solutions
* Lead refactors for older UI code to align with design tokens, performance, and clarity
* Participate in interviews, mentor juniors, and write internal docs or dev blogs
* Work with product on trade\\-offs like SSR vs CSR, modal reuse vs code\\-splitting, form state vs server sync, etc.


**Culture Fit – Are You One of Us?**
* We’re a team of makers and engineers who value clarity, ownership, and long\\-term craft.
* We don’t micromanage. We expect you to lead by example, debug in production, and help others grow.
* We live by craft, feedback, and fast iteration. If you love shipping UI that feels smooth, speaks the design language fluently, and performs under pressure this is your team.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://in.linkedin.com/company/saleshandy","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQHchWSkKJcafw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1652336074453/saleshandy_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=BpoxxxWrR_3bGuSXcmep92FZ0-pR7LVq2c5UwHW_Uww","","","","","","","","","","",""
