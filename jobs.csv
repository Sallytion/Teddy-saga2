**About Pixxel**
 Pixxel is a space data company and spacecraft manufacturer redefining Earth observation with hyperspectral imaging. The company’s first three commercial hyperspectral satellites—Fireflies—deliver imagery at 5\\-meter resolution and 135\\+ spectral bands, providing 50x richer detail than traditional Earth observation systems and unlocking insights across agriculture, climate, energy, environment, and more.
   

  

 Once fully deployed, Pixxel’s constellation of 18\\-24 satellites will capture imagery across up to 250 bands in VNIR and SWIR ranges, with a 40 km swath and daily global revisit capability. Pixxel’s most unique strength is its full\\-stack approach, integrating every layer of the value chain from satellite hardware and manufacturing to AI\\-powered analytics.
   

  

 Pixxel’s satellite constellation is complemented by Aurora, its in\\-house Earth Observation Studio that simplifies satellite imagery analysis and democratises remote sensing for all. Designed to make hyperspectral data more accessible, Aurora by Pixxel combines high\\-frequency imagery with AI\\-powered tools to generate actionable insights, even for users without technical backgrounds. The third pillar of Pixxel’s ecosystem is its in\\-house satellite manufacturing capability. Beyond building its own spacecraft, Pixxel also provides satellite systems and subsystems to other organisations. This dual capacity sets it apart in a sector where most companies focus on either payload design or data operations, but not both.
   

  

 Pixxel’s team is young but deeply mission\\-aligned, with a culture rooted in curiosity, speed, and long\\-term thinking. As the company grows its constellation and expands Aurora, the focus remains on making space\\-based insights practical, scalable, and genuinely helpful so that the health of the planet becomes measurable and action becomes possible.
   

  

 Pixxel was the only Indian startup selected for the Techstars Starburst Space Accelerator in Los Angeles and has been recognised in TIME’s Best Inventions of 2023, Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, and Via Satellite’s Top Innovators list.
   

  

 For more information, see our Careers page or follow Pixxel on LinkedIn and X/Twitter.
   

  

 Culture
   

  

 Pixxel is an organization where we enable our employees to work on world\\-changing problems that they are passionate about, and a place where they can be their best selves day in and day out while ensuring they have fun every day.
   

  

 Central to our employee\\-first ethos is a commitment to ensuring that every team member feels valued and heard. We nurture a healthy and supportive work environment where we prioritise well\\-being and growth in all aspects of life

 our digital products and services through the use of new and existing technology and agile delivery methods to deliver at pace. We are building,
   

 integrating and using software to solve complex problems. At the same time, we provide a home for digital skills to both develop and extend the
   

 technical, people and business skills needed to ensure continuous development and growth of our digital capability.
   

 To fulfill our IKEA vision, “a better everyday life for the many people,” we need to ensure that the software solutions we create, and use are sound
   

 and sustainable for both our customers and co\\-workers at large. The People Domain We enable Ingka and our people to grow sustainably, through
   

 modern \\& efficient human resource technology, leading the group’s digital agenda in sub\\-domains involving Talent, Total Rewards, People
   

 Management and People Planning.
   

 Who you are
   

 You’re a seasoned engineer with a passion for building smart, automatically tested, and well\\-functioning systems. You want to grow yourself and
   

 help others to grow, you are not afraid to ask nor to share, you want to do the right thing! You know your best practices, microservice architecture,
   

 testing, automation, and cloud development, and the tools that come with it. Perfect code doesn’t exist, but you still chase it, without giving up on
   

 delivering value. Our landscape is huge, there are many domains and subdomains you will work with, so you need to understand how to reach out
   

 to people and reach consent – all whilst knowing that perfect is the enemy of good. You always have a big backlog, but you have a good
   

 understanding of what adds value now and what can wait, and you can explain your thoughts to others.
   

 Below are preferred technical skills:
   

 • 5\\+ years of experience in Java /Kotlin or similar programming language experience writing well\\-designed, efficient code
   

 • Cloud experience, GCP preferred, Alibaba Cloud is also of interest
   

 • Docker, Kubernetes, or other container technologies using modern DevOps practices
   

 • Sprint Boot microservices and API management
   

 • Event\\-driven architecture using tools like Kafka, Pub/Sub, etc.
   

 • Experience with a modern, fully automated development and deployment process

 renew and improve, simplicity, different with a meaning and caring for people and planet. You can read more about our values and life at IKEA at

**A DAY IN YOUR LIFE WITH US** 




  





 We’re a unique company that gives you space to fit in and enables you to make use of your skills. Our systems are being used by over 170,000 co?workers and serve over 4 billion customers globally!
   

 We’re in the midst of the transformation from legacy monoliths to an event\\-driven cloud architecture. You wouldn’t have dealt with as many orders
   

 as go through our system (and if you have – talk to me!), so scalability becomes second nature, for both performance and cost.
   

 There are heaps of challenges in front of us, but we’re prepared and look forward to becoming truly agile with modern architecture – and maybe
   

 with your help.
   

 We’re not chasing shareholder value; we want to help the many people to have a better everyday life.
   

 Order Management – you might know it, or you might have no clue! Either is fine, as we’ll help you to get an understanding and find your ways
   

 around creating, executing, releasing, and deviating orders. This won’t get boring thanks to the many different flows and integrations in our omni?channel setup!
   

 We aim to have driven, empowered agile teams who understand priorities and how to come to agreements with other teams and domains. We’re all
   

 in this together and we try to help others and share our knowledge often.
   

 We want to become the best in class – yes, that’s a lofty goal, but why aim for less? If you feel the same then you’ll fit right in, come and help us
   

 push boundaries!
   

 We have values and we live them – they’re all important and I’m happy to share them with you in more detail, but these stand out for me:
   

 Togetherness, Simplicity, leading by example, and different with a meaning – get in touch and I can explain in detail!
