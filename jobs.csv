 You like software that feels calm. In school, clubs, or an internship, you shipped things people used—and you learned that the best releases are the ones where everything that could break already broke in
 
**dev/UAT** 

 (on purpose).
 




  





 You also know some truths only show up under
 **real traffic** 

 , so you ship behind flags, watch the graphs, and make the next release calmer. You never say “it works on my laptop,” because your laptop
 
**mimics prod** 

 : containers, seeded fixtures, contract tests, and mocks for the sharp edges.
 





 We’re building a
 
**WealthTech app** 

 with
 
**assisted trading** 

 (advisors in the loop), a clean
 
**360° portfolio** 

 view, and ideas users act on. It has to be fast, stable, and simple—because real clients and advisors rely on it.
 




  





**Mission:** 

 Ship
 
**simple, dependable** 

 features end‑to‑end—with guidance—
 
**types first, tests included, infra‑aware** 

 .
 




**What you’ll do (one line!)** 

 Build small features that make real users’ days easier, write the tests, and learn to operate what you ship. You will be guided by Principle Engineers \\- so don’t sweat \\- you will have help!
 




  





**What you’ll do** 



* Build product surfaces in
 
**React/Next.js \\+ TypeScript** 

 ; pair to wire APIs to
 
**Node.js/Express/Nest** 

 .
* Keep contracts honest with
 
**TypeScript \\+ Zod/JSON Schema** 

 ; write
 
**unit/integration/e2e** 

 tests that run in CI (RTL/Jest/Vitest/Playwright).
* Add
 
**feature flags** 

 , basic
 
**telemetry** 

 (events, logs), and
 
**tracing** 

 to see what happens after release.
* Use
 
**Docker dev containers** 

 , seeded fixtures,
 
**MSW mocks** 

 , and
 
**Storybook** 

 so local ≈ prod; keep PRs small and focused.
* After release: read dashboards, fix papercuts, tighten copy/flows—the
 
**closed loop** 

 —and write short notes.
* Use
 
**Cursor/Copilot** 

 to scaffold code, tests, and docs—then
 
**review and explain** 

 every change.
* Work
 
**async‑first** 

 : plan your time, ask for help early, communicate clearly in Slack/Docs.



  





**How we build (principles)** 



* **Keep it small.** 

 Small PRs, small blast radius.
* **Types earn trust.** 

 Make invalid states unrepresentable.
* **Tests tell stories.** 

 Happy path \\+ edges; guardrails in CI.
* **Prod reveals truth—safely.** 

 Flags, canaries, synthetic load; fast rollbacks.
* **Parity over excuses.** 

 No “works on my laptop”—containers, seeded data, contract tests, mocks.
* **UAT isn't a ceremony.** 

 Masked prod‑like data; idempotent migrations and backfills run there first.
* **GenAI is a power tool,** 

 not a crutch. We review, we measure.
* **Infra is part of the job.** 

 Observability over optimism; boring deploys beat heroic fixes.
* **Jargon‑light, clarity‑heavy.** 

 Plain words beat buzzwords.



  





**What you bring** 



* **New grad or 0–2 years** 

 experience (internships welcome).
* Comfortable with
 
**JavaScript/TypeScript** 

 ,
 
**React** 

 basics, and a backend intro (
 
**Node.js** 

 ).
* Basics in
 
**Git/GitHub** 

 , SQL, and writing tests; curiosity about performance \\& a11y.
* Strong writing, growth mindset, and crisp async communication in a remote setup.



  





**Nice to have** 



* Projects or internships in
 
**fintech/wealth** 

 , charts/data‑viz,
 
**Tailwind/shadcn** 

 , or
 
**Docker** 

 basics.
* Interest in markets (you’ve tried paper trading) or product craft (you read
 
**WIRED** 

 or design/eng books).



  





**Extra credit — tiny book club** 



* A chapter that stuck with you from
 
**Refactoring** 

 or
 
**The Pragmatic Programmer** 

 —and how you used it.
* One idea you tried from
 
**Analysis Patterns** 

 (or similar) on a school project.
