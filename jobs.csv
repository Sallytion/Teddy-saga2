 **large language model magic** 
 into
 **production\\-grade agentic systems and workflows** 
 that solve real problems for the world’s largest enterprises.
 



 We’ve recently raised
 **$10 million in seed funding** 
 💰 and are scaling fast across
 **Dubai, Bengaluru, and Saudi Arabia** 
 .
 



**👥 The Team Behind OrbitronAI** 




 Founded by an
 **exceptional leadership team** 
 of:
 


* Former
 **EY Partners**
* Ex\\-CTOs and
 **Heads of Engineering** 
 from successful
 **Series B\\+ startups**



 The founding team brings together seasoned business, product and engineering leaders who have built and scaled organizations and led
 **enterprise projects valued at over $1 billion** 
 .
 



**🌟 Why Join OrbitronAI?** 



* **Massive Impact, Real Ownership** 
 → Ship end\\-to\\-end features, own outcomes, and see your work power mission\\-critical systems.
* **Battle\\-Tested Leadership** 
 → Learn and grow with seasoned leaders who bring deep industry expertise and
 **zero ego** 
 .
* **Cutting Edge Stack** 
 → Work with
 **GenAI frontier models, Java, Python, Go, TypeScript, GCP \\& edge compute, Vector DBs, DAG engines** 
 .



**🧬 Our Cultural DNA** 



* **Hustle** 
 → Move with urgency, bias for action, celebrate shipping.
* **Ownership \\& Commitment** 
 → Act like a founder — your decisions shape the company.
* **Founder’s Mindset** 
 → Challenge ideas, not people. Seek truth, not consensus.
* **Continuous Learning** 
 → No legacy thinking; we invest in upskilling and sponsor courses \\& conferences.
* **Pride in Craft** 
 → Pixel\\-perfect UIs, rock\\-solid infra, clean code. If it has your name on it, make it remarkable.
* **No\\-Ego Zone** 
 → Brilliant ≠ arrogant. We win together by being kind, direct, and respectful.



**Why This Role** 




 We’re not building yet another AI tool — we’re building agentic systems that think, decide, and act autonomously inside real enterprises. This isn’t just about chatbots or wrappers around LLM APIs. It’s about unlocking the next paradigm of software where AI agents become teammates — navigating data, taking action, coordinating with systems, and adapting over time.
 



 As an early AI engineer, you won’t just fine\\-tune prompts — you’ll architect intelligent systems that operate across CRMs, databases, compliance tools, customer workflows, and more. This is your chance to shape how agents are built and deployed in the real world, not just demoed in labs. We’re looking for ambitious minds who want to build something foundational — not just follow trends.
 



**Bonus: You’ll work in an environment where using AI tools to boost your own efficiency is expected, not optional.** 




  





**What You’ll Do** 




 At our startup, we’re not just building AI features — we’re rethinking how software behaves through agents that perceive, plan, and act in enterprise environments. As one of our early AI engineers, you’ll:
 


* Design and deploy cutting\\-edge AI agents using our orchestration layer built on n8n, Temporal, and next\\-gen agentic stacks.
* Build intelligent, context\\-aware workflows that plug directly into enterprise systems — transforming how business make decisions, serve customers, and manage operations.
* Prototype fast. Iterate faster. You’ll test, fail, learn, and ship production\\-grade AI agent flows that power real business outcomes.
* Collaborate with product and design to identify high\\-impact user journeys where AI can be a 10x unlock — and then build them.
* Push the limits of RAG, embeddings, and vector search to bring real\\-time, grounded intelligence into every agent decision.
* Engineer smart integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, and other LLMs — blending in enterprise APIs, CRMs, internal tools, and more.
* Lead development of multi\\-agent orchestration flows: planner\\-executor models, memory layers, persona\\-based behaviors, and tool\\-using agents.
* Own the AI pipeline end\\-to\\-end: prompt engineering, dynamic context handling, agent simulation and evaluation, all the way to deployment and monitoring.
* Help set the bar for reliability, latency, and safety of AI outputs — your work will shape how users trust AI inside their organizations.
* Work alongside curious, driven people who care deeply about shipping transformative products, not just academic demos.



**What You Bring** 



* Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience.
* 8\\+ years of hands\\-on experience in applied machine learning, NLP, or AI system development, particularly with LLMs and agentic frameworks.
* Deep familairity with large language models such as GPT\\-4, Claude, or similar; including prompt tuning, fine\\-tuning, or API\\-based deployment.
* Hands\\-on experience with Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using vector stores and embeddings.
* Knowledge of multi\\-agent systems, task orchestration, and related architectures.
* Proficiency in Python and modern ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
* Experience integrating with agent orchestration frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, Temporal, n8n, or custom stacks.
* Solid understanding of enterprise software principles, including version control, CI/CD pipelines, API design, and performance monitoring.
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills; ability to thrive in a fast\\-paced, startup environment with evolving priorities.



**Perks \\& Benefits** 



* Top‑Tier Compensation \\& stock options with substantial potential upside.
* Latest MacBook Pros \\+ 4K monitors
* Paid AI tool \\& cloud credits to experiment freely
* Premium health, wellness, and learning budgets
* A culture celebrating every victory.
* Continuous learning and skill development opportunities.
* Flexible PTO and work hours.","Software Development","https://ae.linkedin.com/company/orbitronai-com","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQFSUe-DWrMDsw/company-logo_100_100/B4DZhbSaJeGsAU-/0/1753878209755?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=8xmLziKY6mdaNSgshJMo1i3i3hrBoLtPJprg-MfoXrw","","","","","","","","","","",""
