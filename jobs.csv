**About Galileo**
 Galileo is the leading platform for Gen AI evaluation and observability, with a mission to democratize building safe, reliable and robust applications in the new era of AI powered software development. Our foundation is built on pioneering the early technology behind the world's most ubiquitous AI applications including Apple's Siri and Google Speech. We firmly believe that AI developers require meticulously crafted, research\\-driven tools to create trustworthy and high\\-quality generative AI applications that will revolutionize our work and lifestyle.
   

  

 Galileo addresses the complexities inherent in implementing, evaluating, and monitoring GenAI applications, optimizing the development process for both individual developers and teams by offering a comprehensive platform that spans the full AI development lifecycle. Galileo bridges critical gaps, significantly enhancing developers' ability to refine and deploy reliable and precise GenAI applications.
   

  

 Since its inception, Galileo has rapidly gained traction, serving Fortune 100 banks, Fortune 50 telecom companies, as well as AI teams at prominent organizations such as Reddit and Headspace Health, among dozens of others.
   

  

 Galileo has AI research at its core, with the founders coming from Google and Uber where they solved challenging AI/ML problems in the Speech, Evaluation and ML Infra domains. It is now a Series B business backed by tier 1 investors including Battery Ventures, Scale Venture Partners, and Databricks Ventures, with $68M in total funding. We are headquartered in San Francisco with locations such as New York and Bangalore, India forming our areas of future growth.
   

  

**About The Role**
 You'll be responsible for the backbone that powers Galileo’s platform. This role is all about solving hard systems problems at scale and making our infrastructure resilient, fast, and reliable.
   

  

**In This Role, You Will**
* Build and scale core infrastructure – design and optimize distributed systems and APIs that handle millions of real\\-time queries with low latency and high reliability.
* Develop data\\-intensive systems – work across SQL, NoSQL, time\\-series, and object stores, ensuring data pipelines and lookups are optimized for throughput and efficiency.
* Optimize performance at scale – profile and tune systems for latency, throughput, and cost, ensuring the platform can grow with customer demand.
* Work on real\\-time serving systems – design high\\-throughput caching layers and data lookup services to enable fast, reliable access to large\\-scale datasets.
* Build and extend pub\\-sub and orchestration frameworks – leverage and improve systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Celery to coordinate workloads and streaming data pipelines.
* Design internal developer tooling – create load testing, benchmarking, and performance analysis tools that help us and our customers understand and trust the system.
* Collaborate cross\\-functionally – partner with product, research, and application engineering teams to ensure the platform can support new capabilities, models, and workloads.


**What We're Looking For**
 A talented software engineer excited to work on the backbone of the Galileo platform. We are looking for someone who has built large\\-scale real\\-time infrastructure, services, and APIs that scale to millions of queries. Addressed challenges that come with systems of scale. Worked on and optimized high throughput traffic on SQL and NoSQL data stores, time\\-series databases and/or Object stores.
   

  

 An ideal candidate will have...
   

  

* 6 years of experience
* Experience with large scale distributed systems
* Experience with NoSQL databases and time\\-series databases
* Worked on real\\-time high throughput caching systems
* Excellent python programming skills
* Worked with raw\\-data lookup indexes such as Lucene and/or similar frameworks
* Experience with runtime orchestration and pub\\-sub frameworks like RabbitMQ, Celery, Kafka
* Built low\\-latency data lookup APIs
* Done extensive performance optimizations
* Built internal tooling foundations for performance testing, load testing and benchmarking


**Bonus Skills**
* Experience with time\\-series or columnar databases (e.g., ClickHouse, TimescaleDB, DuckDB)
* Familiarity with distributed query engines or streaming frameworks (Presto, Trino, Flink, Spark Streaming)
* Hands\\-on with container orchestration and scaling systems (Kubernetes, EKS)
* Experience building observability and performance tooling (Grafana, OpenTelemetry, flame graphs)


****Why Galileo****
- Join a seasoned founding team that has previously led product and engineering teams from 0 to $100M\\+ in revenue and from 0 to 1B\\+ users globally

- We obsess over our team’s culture driven by inclusivity, empathy and curiosity
