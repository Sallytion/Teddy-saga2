 When BlackRock was started in 1988, its founders envisioned a company that combined the best of financial services with cutting edge technology. They imagined a business that would provide financial services to clients as well as technology services to other financial firms. The result of their vision is Aladdin, our industry leading, end\\-to\\-end investment management platform. With assets valued over USD $7 trillion managed on Aladdin, our technology empowers millions of investors to save for retirement, pay for college, buy a home and improve their financial wellbeing.

 Deployment and maintenance require close interaction with various teams. This requires maintaining a positive and collaborative working relationship with teams within DOE as well as with wider Aladdin developer community. Production support for applications is usually required for issues that cannot be resolved by operations team. Creative and inventive problem\\-solving skills for reduced turnaround times are highly valued.
   

  

 Preparing user documentation to maintain both development and operations continuity is integral to the role. Adhering to BlackRock's UX and design standards is expected and contributing towards upkeep of those standards is encouraged.
