 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""

 We’re hiring a hands\\-on Data Analyst to turn business questions into reliable datasets, clear visuals, and automated workflows. You’ll build and maintain Power BI dashboards, shape data models, and orchestrate pipelines using Microsoft Fabric. You’ll also own Make.com automation for API\\-based data acquisition and notifications, perform web scraping (ethically and compliantly), and write Python to automate, cleanse, and enrich data. The ideal candidate is equal parts analyst and problem\\-solver, comfortable moving from stakeholder requirements to production\\-grade dashboards and automations.
 



  





**What You’ll Do** 




**Business Intelligence \\& Visualization** 



* Build, iterate, and maintain Power BI dashboards; design robust data models (Power Query, DAX), optimize performance, and manage Row\\-Level Security (RLS).
* Translate stakeholder requirements into insightful visuals and clear data stories; support production refreshes and user inquiries.



**Data Engineering with Power BI \\& Fabric** 



* Use Microsoft Fabric (e.g., Dataflows Gen2/Lakehouse/Pipelines) or Gen1 Power BI dataflows to build reliable ETL/ELT processes and refresh schedules.
* Query and validate data with SQL (plus KQL/PySpark where applicable for larger or log\\-style datasets).



**Automation with Make.com \\& Power Automate** 



* Design, build, and maintain Make.com scenarios (HTTP modules, routers, iterators, data stores) to integrate third‑party REST APIs, webhooks, and internal systems; implement scheduling, logging, alerting, retries, and error handling.
* Use Power Automate for complementary internal workflow automation and notifications.



**API Integration \\& Data Acquisition** 



* Connect to external services via REST/Graph APIs (OAuth/API keys), handle pagination and rate limits, and ingest JSON into curated datasets for BI and analytics.
* Configure inbound/outbound webhooks between Make.com, Monday.com, and other tools to streamline processes.



**Web Scraping** 



* Build targeted scrapers (Make.com HTTP \\+ parsing or Python with requests/beautifulsoup4/playwright/scrapy) to collect publicly available data.



**Python for Analytics \\& Ops** 



* Write production‑minded Python for data cleaning, reconciliation, and transformations (e.g., pandas); package repeatable scripts, add unit tests where practical, and schedule jobs via Fabric or Make.com.



**Platform \\& Stakeholder Support** 



* Provide first‑line support for BI dashboards, dataset refreshes, and workflow issues; help administer Monday.com (permissions, simple automations, troubleshooting).
* Document data models, metrics, pipelines, and scenarios; champion data quality and governance.



  





**What You’ll Bring** 




**Required Qualifications** 



* Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (or equivalent experience).
* 2–5 years in data analytics/BI with hands‑on Power BI (data modeling, DAX, refreshes, RLS).
* Practical experience building automations in Make.com (or similar: Power Automate/Zapier/n8n), integrating REST APIs and webhooks.
* Python skills for ETL/automation/scraping (e.g., pandas, requests, bs4, playwright/scrapy).
