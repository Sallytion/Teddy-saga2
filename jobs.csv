We develop and maintain the core platform that powers search, personalization, and content discovery at scale across every Roku device and service.
 

  
 





 We are a technically diverse and collaborative team that values ownership, transparency, and a culture of continuous improvement. We work closely with colleagues across platforms and infrastructure teams to deliver high\\-performance distributed systems and observability capabilities that enable real\\-time search, ranking, and recommendations.
 

  
 





 Our work includes designing and optimizing online inference infrastructure, feature stores, and data pipelines — all seamlessly integrated with the broader platform ecosystem (Kubernetes, Istio, Envoy). We’re passionate about solving complex technical challenges that have a direct impact on how users experience Roku.
 




  
 


**About the Role**

  
 


 We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer with experience in building scalable, reliable systems to help evolve and extend the infrastructure behind our Search and Recommendations platform. In this role, you’ll be part of a cross\\-functional, globally distributed team dedicated to creating fast, cost\\-efficient solutions that deliver relevant and seamless user experiences.
 

  
 





 You’ll contribute to the design, development, and operation of critical systems that power real\\-time search and personalised recommendations for millions of users.

 We are a fast\\-moving team with a strong engineering culture built on clear communication, thoughtful decision\\-making, and a shared commitment to delivering impactful solutions. Collaboration is fundamental to how we work — we invest as much in supporting our growth as we do in building exceptional systems.

* Design, build, and operate platform infrastructure powering real\\-time search and personalised recommendations


* Work closely with machine learning engineers, data scientists, and infrastructure teams to scale our Machine Learning Platform


* Shape the roadmap for our next\\-generation architecture, including improvements in cost efficiency, observability, and resilience


* Drive tooling and standardisation, working with the broader platform teams to identify and align on shared approaches

* Proficiency in modern backend languages (Java, Python, Go) and scalable cloud\\-native architectures (AWS, Kubernetes, service meshes, etc.)


* Deep knowledge of DevOps practices, SRE principles, infrastructure\\-as\\-code, and real\\-time data processing


* Experience collaborating with engineers and product stakeholders to shape features and systems


* A platform mindset: you design with reuse, observability, and scale in mind, supporting not only your team but the broader engineering organization


* A track record of improving performance, cost efficiency, and maintainability in complex environments


* Expertise in deploying and operating observability and tracing tools such as OpenTelemetry, Grafana Tempo, Thanos, Loki, and Prometheus at scale

Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter.
 



  
 


**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.
