 Rippling is the first way for businesses to manage all of their HR \\& IT—payroll, benefits, computers, apps, and more—in one unified workforce platform.
   

  

 By connecting every workforce system to a single source of truth for employee data, businesses can automate all of the manual work they normally need to do to make employee changes. Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can just click a button and set up a new employee’s payroll, health insurance, work computer, and third\\-party apps—like Slack, Zoom, and Office 365—all within 90 seconds.
   

  

 Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1\\.4B\\+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, and Sequoia—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes (\\#12 out of 500\\).

 Rippling is looking for a Software Engineer to join our Mobile Platform team. Unlike product teams that focus on specific user features, the Platform team builds the engine that powers the entire Rippling mobile application. We are the ""engineers for engineers,"" focused on architecture, performance, developer tooling, and the core infrastructure that enables product teams to move fast.
   

  

 We are looking for engineers with strong foundations in mobile engineering—whether your background is deep in iOS (Swift/Obj\\-C), Android (Kotlin/Java), or React Native.

* Performance \\& Scale: Optimize the application for maximum speed and scalability. You will dive deep into app startup times, memory usage, and scroll performance across both the JavaScript and Native layers.
* Developer Experience: Help streamline our CI/CD pipelines and build developer tools that boost the productivity of the entire mobile organization.
* Collaborate and Own: Work closely with Product, Design, and other engineering teams to solve open\\-ended technical problems and create efficient, reusable solutions.


****Qualifications:****
* 3\\+ years of professional experience in mobile software engineering.
* Mobile Expertise: Deep proficiency in ONE of the following areas:
* 
+ Native iOS: (Swift/Objective\\-C) with a solid understanding of the iOS lifecycle and ecosystem.
+ Native Android: (Kotlin/Java) with a deep understanding of Android internals and Gradle.
+ React Native: Strong command of JS/TS fundamentals and the React lifecycle.

* Strong background in algorithms, data structures, and system design.
* Ability to own well\\-defined projects with autonomy and identify the right solutions for complex problems.
* Strong interpersonal skills to collaborate effectively with cross\\-functional teams.


****Good to have:****
* React Native for Native Devs: If you are a Native iOS/Android developer, prior exposure to React Native is a huge plus.
* Native for RN Devs: If you are a React Native developer, experience writing native code (Swift/Kotlin) is a huge plus.
* TypeScript: Experience with TypeScript and modern JavaScript tooling.
* Tooling: Experience with mobile build tools (Fastlane, Xcode Server, GitHub Actions, Bitrise etc.,)
