**About Us \\& Product Vision** 




 We are a product\\-led engineering company committed to building world\\-class software used across geographies (UK, Australia, and beyond). You’ll get to work on real international products, not internal tools.
 



  





 You will join the team working actively on
 **two flagship products** 
 :
 


* FinOps / cloud cost optimization platform using AI to reduce cloud waste, manage cloud expenditures, and improve cloud operations.
* A SaaS platform for Amazon sellers (Australia\\-based) offering deep analytics, ASIN scoring, supplier verification, profit calculation, and product discovery tools. Astro Advanced Analytics



  





 By joining, you’ll have a chance to contribute to the product roadmap, features, scale, and long\\-term architecture for both these products serving users in global markets.
 



 You’ll operate in an environment where
 **AI is an enabler** 
 , not a crutch — you use AI for speed (e.g., scaffolding, suggestions) but logic, domain understanding, correctness, and architectural thinking remain yours.
 



  





**Role \\& Responsibilities** 



* Build and own features end to end: front\\-end UI, back\\-end APIs, microservices, business logic
* Work with HTML, CSS, Tailwind, React (frontend) and Node.js or C\\# (backend)

* Participate in architectural discussions, system design, performance optimization
* Use AI\\-assisted tools (e.g., code suggestion, generation, sofa, Review) wisely — speed up routine parts, but you are responsible for correctness \\& logic
* Collaborate with product owners, designers, QA, operations
* Engage in continuous learning, mentoring, and code reviews

**Trait / Skill \\-** 
*Why It Matters* 




**Core technical foundation \\-** 
*Strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, system design* 




**Full\\-stack or backend experience** 
 \\-
 *You should be comfortable switching between frontend \\& backend* 




**Ownership \\& product mindset** 
 \\-
 *You treat your module/feature as your product — you care about correctness, performance, UX* 




**Willingness to learn \\& adapt** 
 \\-
 *We use cutting\\-edge practices — you should be curious \\& proactive* 




**AI\\-savvy but logically grounded** 
 \\-
 *You are excited about AI tools but won’t blindly trust them — you understand trade\\-offs* 




**Strong communication \\& collaboration** 
 \\-
 *Working across time zones, with international stakeholders, clear communication is crucial.* 




**Testing\\-first mentality** 
 \\-
 *You believe TDD/BDD aren’t optional; you write maintainable, testable code*
