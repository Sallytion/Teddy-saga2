* Data plumbing from the client: Typed SDKs, TanStack Query data hooks, optimistic updates, error boundaries, and offline\\-tolerant flows.
* Own end\\-to\\-end features: React UI → typed APIs → AWS services → DynamoDB/OpenSearch queries and indices → metrics/observability.
* Performance \\& accessibility: Lighthouse\\-driven perf, a11y best practices, and design\\-system components.
* Reliability \\& security by default: Multi\\-tenant guardrails (RBAC/OPA\\-style), Cognito/OAuth flows, audit trails, and least\\-privilege patterns.
* Operational excellence: CI/CD pipelines, preview apps, feature flags, dashboards/alerts; instrument UX with analytics.



  




 Tech You’ll Use Here
 * Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite/Next.js, TanStack Query, Zustand/Redux, Tailwind/Chakra/Headless UI, Storybook, Vitest/Jest/RTL.
* Backend/Infra: AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, ECS Fargate, S3, CloudFront, EventBridge, SQS/SNS, CloudWatch), DynamoDB (PK/SK, GSIs, TTL), OpenSearch (mappings, analyzers, aggregations), Node.js.
* Platform \\& DevEx: Terraform/IaC, GitHub Actions, OpenAPI/JSON Schema, Sentry, Segment/Amplitude.



  




 Minimum Qualifications
 * 4\\+ years building production web apps with React and TypeScript.

* Experience designing and consuming typed HTTP APIs; comfortable shaping contracts and payloads.
* Solid AWS experience shipping user\\-facing features backed by API Gateway/Lambda/ECS.
* Practical NoSQL modeling with DynamoDB (PK/SK design, GSIs, conditional writes, pagination) and event\\-driven patterns.
* Hands\\-on with OpenSearch (index design, text analyzers, relevance tuning, filters/aggregations) or Elasticsearch.
* You ship: CI/CD, code reviews, testing culture, meaningful metrics.



  




 Nice to Have
 * Built embeddable widgets/SDKs adopted by external developer teams.
* Multi\\-tenant SaaS experience (RBAC, org scoping, audit logs, rate limiting).
* Cognito/OAuth/OIDC, JWT, and session management in SPAs.
* Familiarity with Bedrock/OpenAI gateways, prompt tooling, or LangGraph/LangChain.
* Storybook/Chromatic visual testing; design\\-system stewardship.
* Terraform on AWS; cost\\-aware design and observability.



  




 How We Work
 * Short planning cycles, crisp tickets, and demo\\-driven development.
* “You build it, you own it”: instrumentation, docs, and on\\-call within reason.
* Pragmatic, product\\-first mindset—bias to ship, measure, iterate.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/verity-labs-ai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGo_JX-7bRNug/company-logo_100_100/B56ZbFGv23H0AU-/0/1747063602899/verity_labs_ai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=9Au5CX8ZkTzgOQhngV_4EbpWH86ADJg9LGVBgpvWuoI","","","","","","","","","","",""
