 We are looking for a high\\-level Unity Developer who specializes in UI Engineering. Your core responsibility is bridging the gap between Design and Code. You will take high\\-fidelity designs from Figma and rebuild them in Unity (uGUI) with 100% pixel\\-perfect accuracy and premium ""Game Juice"" animations.
 



  





 Important: You do not need to create the art. You need to be an expert at implementing the art.
 



  





  





  





 Required Technical Knowledge
 



  





 1\\. The Figma\\-to\\-Unity Pipeline (Critical)
 



  





 Figma ""Dev Mode"" Mastery: You must know how to inspect a Figma file to read exact values (padding, margins, hex codes, corner radius) and translate them directly into Unity components. No guessing.
 



 Layout Translation: You understand that Figma’s ""Auto Layout"" \\= Unity’s ""Horizontal/Vertical Layout Groups."" You know how to map these 1:1 so the UI behaves exactly as the designer intended.
 



 Asset Export Logic: You know how to correctly export vectors as high\\-res PNGs (2x, 3x scale) for Retina displays versus exporting SVGs for specific use cases.
 



 Component Mapping: You know how to look at a ""Master Component"" in Figma and turn it into a reusable Prefab in Unity.
 



  





  





 2\\. Advanced Unity UI (uGUI)
 



  





 Responsive Architecture: Deep knowledge of Canvas Scaler, Anchors, and Pivots. You can build a UI that looks perfect on an iPad Pro, a long iPhone 15, and a small Android device without breaking.
 



 9\\-Slicing Specialist: You know how to set up sprites with 9\\-slice borders so buttons and panels stretch cleanly without blurring the edges.
 



 Text \\& Typography: Experience with TextMeshPro (TMP) to match Figma’s font rendering, including line height, character spacing, and material presets.
 



  





  





 3\\. Animation \\& ""Game Juice"" (Code\\-Driven)
 



  





 Tweening Libraries: Mastery of DOTween (or PrimeTween) to script complex UI transitions (e.g., Popup scales up with an 'ElasticOut' ease).
 



 Particle Systems: Ability to implement ""Victory"" effects, confetti, and glows using Unity’s Particle System to mimic premium game feel.
 



 Shaders: Basic knowledge of Shader Graph to add polish (e.g., shiny glossy effects on tiles) is a huge plus.
 



  





  





 4\\. Core Engineering
 



  





 C\\# Architecture: Clean, modular code. (No ""spaghetti code"" in the UI Manager).
 



 Mobile Optimization: Keeping ""Draw Calls"" low and ensuring 60 FPS performance on low\\-end Android devices.
 



 SDKs: Experience integrating AdMob / AppLovin and Analytics.
