 • Identify edge cases in scheduling logic (overlaps, timezones, last\\-minute changes)
 



 • Debug issues across backend, dashboard, and mobile app
 



 • Ensure consistent performance and reliability as user load increases
 



 • Collaborate on improving system stability and reducing production errors
 



  





 Scalability \\& System Design
 



  





 • Write code that remains stable with \\~1,000 users
 



 • Optimize backend endpoints, caching, and DB queries

 At Kyndryl, we design, build, manage and modernize the mission\\-critical technology systems that the world depends on every day. So why work at Kyndryl? We are always moving forward – always pushing ourselves to go further in our efforts to build a more equitable, inclusive world for our employees, our customers and our communities.
   

  

**The Role**
 Infrastructure Specialists at Kyndryl are project\\-based subject matter experts in all things infrastructure – good at providing analysis, documenting and diagraming work for hand\\-off, offering timely solutions, and generally “figuring it out.” This is a hands\\-on role where your feel for the interaction between a system and its environment will be invaluable to every one of your clients.
   

  

 There are two halves to this role: First, contributing to current projects where you analyze problems and tech issues, offer solutions, and test, modify, automate, and integrate systems. And second, long\\-range strategic planning of IT infrastructure and operational execution. This role isn’t specific to any one platform, so you’ll need a good feel for all of them. And because of this, you’ll experience variety and growth at Kyndryl that you won’t find anywhere else.
   

  

* Design and document application architecture for new and existing systems.
* Lead the selection of technologies, frameworks, and platforms.
* Collaborate with business analysts, developers, and stakeholders to translate requirements into technical solutions.
* Ensure architectural consistency and adherence to best practices across development teams.
* Evaluate and recommend tools for performance monitoring, security, and integration.
* Guide the modernization of legacy systems and support redevelopment initiatives.
* Conduct code reviews and provide mentorship to development teams.
* Define and enforce coding standards, design patterns, and architectural principles.
* Stay current with emerging technologies and industry trends.


 You’ll be involved early to offer solutions, help decide whether something can be done, and identify the technical and timeline risks up front. This means dealing with both client expectations and internal challenges – in other words, there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference, and a lot of people will witness your contributions. In fact, a frequent sign of success for our Infrastructure Specialists is when clients come back to us and ask for the same person by name. That’s the kind of impact you can have!
   

  

 This is a project\\-based role where you’ll enjoy deep involvement throughout the lifespan of a project, as well as the chance to work closely with Architects, Technicians, and PMs. Whatever your current level of tech savvy or where you want your career to lead, you’ll find the right opportunities and a buddy to support your growth. Boredom? Trust us, that won’t be an issue.
   

  

 Your future at Kyndryl
   

  

 There are lots of opportunities to gain certification and qualifications on the job, and you’ll continuously grow as a Cloud Hyperscaler. Many of our Infrastructure Specialists are on a path toward becoming either an Architect or Distinguished Engineer, and there are opportunities at every skill level to grow in either of these directions.
   

  

**Who You Are**
 You’re good at what you do and possess the required experience to prove it. However, equally as important – you have a growth mindset; keen to drive your own personal and professional development. You are customer\\-focused – someone who prioritizes customer success in their work. And finally, you’re open and borderless – naturally inclusive in how you work with others.
   

  

**Required Technical And Professional Experience**
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field.
* 8\\+ years of experience in software development, with 3\\+ years in architecture roles.
* Strong understanding of Cobol code and architecture as well as the common patterns for understanding them and converting to modern object oriented applications.
* Proficiency in enterprise integration patterns, RESTful services, and event\\-driven architecture.
* Understanding of Mainframe performance characteristics, batch jobs, etc...
* Experience leveraging AI tools in the SDLC
* Experience with CI/CD pipelines, DevOps practices, and agile methodologies.
* Excellent communication and leadership skills.
* Ability to balance technical depth with business context.
* Preferred Qualifications Experience with application migration and modernization
* Familiarity with legacy modernization, data migrations, data lake, big data, and analytics platforms.
* Exposure to security frameworks and compliance standards (e.g., ISO, GDPR, HIPAA).
* Experience using AI tools for code analysis Experience with legacy application development paradigms
