 The Team: From the merchandise stores at Sports venues to small\\-format stores such as Amazon Go, a new kind of technology is powering stores with no lines and no checkout. You simply use the Amazon app to enter the store, take what you want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals, grocery essentials and merchandise, and go.
   

  

 Our checkout\\-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out (JWO) Technology. It automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a cart. When you’re done shopping, you just leave the store.

Innovation is part of our DNA. We need people who want to join a high\\-reaching program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.

 You will tackle challenging situations every day and you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems. Along the way, we guarantee that you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on many customers.
   

  

 The Role: You are a talented Software Engineer who knows how to design and code full\\-stack solutions. You know how to get things done, and done really well. You are a dreamer and a futurist. You have an inventor’s spirit, a can\\-do approach and proficiency in a wide range of design technologies, and a killer eye for detail. We are looking for talented engineers for Java and AWS services.
   

  

 In this role you’ll have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game\\-changing initiative. While you’ll be able to use existing Amazon systems when possible, you’ll be working on challenging problems that need creative solutions. You should be comfortable building prototypes, challenging assumptions, and thinking of creative ways to tackle challenges.

**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.
