 As part of the AWS Solutions organization, we have a vision to provide business applications, leveraging Amazon’s unique experience and expertise, that are used by millions of companies worldwide to manage day\\-to\\-day operations. We will accomplish this by accelerating our customers’ businesses through delivery of intuitive and differentiated technology solutions that solve enduring business challenges. We blend vision with curiosity and Amazon’s real\\-world experience to build opinionated, turnkey solutions. Where customers prefer to buy over build, we become their trusted partner with solutions that are no\\-brainers to buy and easy to use.
   

  

 The Team: From the merchandise stores at Sports venues to small\\-format stores such as Amazon Go, a new kind of technology is powering stores with no lines and no checkout. You simply use the Amazon app to enter the store, take what you want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals, grocery essentials and merchandise, and go.
   

  

 Our checkout\\-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out (JWO) Technology. It automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a cart. When you’re done shopping, you just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. Designed and custom\\-built by Amazonians, our technology uses computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning. Innovation is part of our DNA. We need people who want to join a high\\-reaching program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.
   

  

 The Role: Everyone on our team needs to be entrepreneurial, wear many hats and work in a highly collaborative environment that’s more startup than big company. We’re solving problems that span a broad range of domains: computer vision, image recognition, machine learning, and distributed systems. This role involves building/scaling Machine Learning platform used for developing all the algorithms at JWO.
   

  

 As a Software Development Engineer, you will help solve a variety of technical challenges and mentor other engineers. You will play an active role in translating business and functional requirements into concrete deliverables and build quick prototypes or proofs of concept in partnership with other technology leaders within the team. You will help invent new features, design, develop and deploy reliable distributed services. You will work with a variety of core languages and technologies including Java, C\\+\\+, Linux.
   

  

 You will tackle challenging situations every day and you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems. Along the way, we guarantee that you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on many customers.
   

  

 The Role: You are a talented Software Engineer who knows how to design and code full\\-stack solutions. You know how to get things done, and done really well. You are a dreamer and a futurist. You have an inventor’s spirit, a can\\-do approach and proficiency in a wide range of design technologies, and a killer eye for detail. We are looking for talented engineers for Java and AWS services.
   

  

 In this role you’ll have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game\\-changing initiative. While you’ll be able to use existing Amazon systems when possible, you’ll be working on challenging problems that need creative solutions. You should be comfortable building prototypes, challenging assumptions, and thinking of creative ways to tackle challenges.
   

  

**Basic Qualifications·**
* 3\\+ years of non\\-internship professional software development experience
* Programming experience with at least one modern language such as Java, C\\+\\+, or C\\# including object\\-oriented design
* 1\\+ years contributing to the architecture and design (architecture, design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and current systems


**Preferred Qualifications·**
* Engineering in Computer Science or related field
* Experience as a key member of a full\\-stack engineering team participating in the complete product development life cycle of successfully launched applications.

 As part of the AWS Applied AI Solutions organization, we have a vision to provide business applications, leveraging Amazon’s unique experience and expertise, that are used by millions of companies worldwide to manage day\\-to\\-day operations. We will accomplish this by accelerating our customers’ businesses through delivery of intuitive and differentiated technology solutions that solve enduring business challenges. We blend vision with curiosity and Amazon’s real\\-world experience to build opinionated, turnkey solutions. Where customers prefer to buy over build, we become their trusted partner with solutions that are no\\-brainers to buy and easy to use.
   

  

 The Team: From the merchandise stores at Sports venues to small\\-format stores such as Amazon Go, a new kind of technology is powering stores with no lines and no checkout. You simply use the Amazon app to enter the store, take what you want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals, grocery essentials and merchandise, and go.
   

  

 Our checkout\\-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out (JWO) Technology. It automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a cart. When you’re done shopping, you just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. Designed and custom\\-built by Amazonians, our technology uses computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning. Innovation is part of our DNA. We need people who want to join a high\\-reaching program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.
   

  

 The Role: Everyone on our team needs to be entrepreneurial, wear many hats and work in a highly collaborative environment that’s more startup than big company. We’re solving problems that span a broad range of domains: computer vision, image recognition, machine learning, and distributed systems. This role involves building/scaling Machine Learning platform used for developing all the algorithms at JWO.
   

  

 As a Software Development Engineer, you will help solve a variety of technical challenges and mentor other engineers. You will play an active role in translating business and functional requirements into concrete deliverables and build quick prototypes or proofs of concept in partnership with other technology leaders within the team. You will help invent new features, design, develop and deploy reliable distributed services. You will work with a variety of core languages and technologies including Java, C\\+\\+, Linux.
   

  

 You will tackle challenging situations every day and you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems. Along the way, we guarantee that you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on many customers.
   

  

 The Role: You are a talented Software Engineer who knows how to design and code full\\-stack solutions. You know how to get things done, and done really well. You are a dreamer and a futurist. You have an inventor’s spirit, a can\\-do approach and proficiency in a wide range of design technologies, and a killer eye for detail. We are looking for talented engineers for Java and AWS services.
   

  

 In this role you’ll have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game\\-changing initiative. While you’ll be able to use existing Amazon systems when possible, you’ll be working on challenging problems that need creative solutions. You should be comfortable building prototypes, challenging assumptions, and thinking of creative ways to tackle challenges.
   

  

**Basic Qualifications·**
* 3\\+ years of non\\-internship professional software development experience
* Programming experience with at least one modern language such as Java, C\\+\\+, or C\\# including object\\-oriented design
* 1\\+ years contributing to the architecture and design (architecture, design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and current systems


**Preferred Qualifications·**
* Engineering in Computer Science or related field
* Experience as a key member of a full\\-stack engineering team participating in the complete product development life cycle of successfully launched applications.
