**What you’ll do** 



* Design and build streaming data pipelines (exactly‑once or effectively‑once) from event sources into low‑latency feature serving and NRT and OLAP queries.
* Develop an AI/ML toolkit: reusable libraries, SDKs, and CLIs for data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
* Stand up and optimize a production feature store (schemas, SCD handling, point‑in‑time correctness, TTL/compaction, backfills).
* Expose features and analytics via well‑designed APIs/Services; integrate with model serving and retrieval for ML/GenAI use cases.
* Build and operationalize Superset dashboards for monitoring data quality, pipeline health, feature drift, model performance, and business KPIs.
* Implement governance and reliability: data contracts, schema evolution, lineage, observability, alerting, and cost controls.
* Partner with UI/UX, data science, and backend teams to ship end‑to‑end workflows from data capture to real‑time inference and decisioning.
* Drive performance: benchmark and tune distributed DB (partitions, indexes, compression, merge settings), streaming frameworks, and query patterns.
* Automate with CI/CD, infrastructure‑as‑code, and reproducible environments for quick, safe releases.



  





**Tech you may use** 




 Languages: Python, Java/Scala, SQL
 



 Streaming/Compute: Kafka (or Pulsar), Spark, Flink, Beam
 



 Storage/OLAP: ClickHouse (primary), object storage (S3/GCS), Parquet/Iceberg/Delta
 



 Orchestration/Workflow: Airflow, dbt (for transformations), Makefiles/Poetry/pipenv
 



 ML/MLOps: MLflow/Weights \\& Biases, KServe/Seldon, Feast/custom feature store patterns, vector stores (optional)
 



 Dashboards/BI: Superset (plugins, theming), Grafana for ops
 



 Platform: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions/GitLab CI, Prometheus/OpenTelemetry
 



 Cloud: AWS/GCP/Azure
 



  





**What we’re looking for** 



1. 4\\+ years building production data/ML or streaming systems with high TPS and large data volumes.
2. Strong coding skills in Python and one of Java/Scala; solid SQL and data modeling.
3. Hands‑on experience with Kafka (or similar), Spark/Flink, and OLAP stores—ideally ClickHouse.
4. GenAI pipelines: retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG), embeddings, prompt/tooling workflows, model evaluation at scale.
5. Proven experience designing feature pipelines with point‑in‑time correctness and backfills; understanding of online/offline consistency.
6. Experience instrumenting Superset dashboards tied to ClickHouse for operational and product analytics.
7. Fluency with CI/CD, containerization, Kubernetes, and infrastructure‑as‑code.
8. Solid grasp of distributed systems and architecture fundamentals: partitioning, consistency, idempotency, retries, batching vs. streaming, and cost/perf trade‑offs.
9. Excellent collaboration skills; ability to work cross‑functionally with DS/ML, product, and UI/UX.
10. Ability to pass a CodeSignal prescreen coding test.
