 Letterdrop is a YC\\-backed seed stage startup. We help sales\\-led companies uncover net new pipeline by finding signals in conversations (on the web, in your CRM, on calls, etc) and automating intelligent outbound and nurture through effective social selling. Most businesses are using AI to create more spam, but selling is relationship driven. We give sellers the tools to automate the tedious tasks and become data\\-oriented about building relationships. You’ll be working directly with me, the CEO to design and build features.
   

  

 Our customers include fastest growing mid\\-market startups like Clay, Crossbeam, Gem, Synthesia, as well as enterprises like Fluke and Mountain. More well known logos we can’t share.
   

  

 We are break\\-even, have more pipeline than we can handle, and growing.
   

  

**About You**
 Need three things in this role:
   

  

* You have strong Computer Science foundations


 You understand memory, parallelization, and runtime from a practical standpoint. You don’t create arrays with 60,000 elements and wonder why you’re running out of memory. AI tools make you faster, but you still need to know what good code looks like.
   

  

 You take pride in clean, maintainable code. You work well on a team. You read others’ code. They read yours. Make both of your lives easy by keeping things simple. If you’d hate reading your own code in 6 months, rewrite it. 2\\.
 **You are hungry and eager to build to ship great product fast**
 You move fast. We’re a startup. Expect to ship multiple bug fixes, improvements, and features per week. Speed matters, but so does stability.
   

  

 You are independent and learn quickly. Everything you need is online \\- documentation, GitHub issues, open\\-source code, spoofing network requests, and AI is there to help you along the way if not do it outright for you. You can navigate it without handholding.
   

  

 You have product taste and care about building great product experiences. Our product is used by sales and marketing teams at fast\\-growing companies. If they run into bugs, poor UX, latency, or crashes, that reflects poorly on us. You want people to use our product and go “Wow!”
   

  

* You are AI\\-native


 Software engineering as we know it from 12 months ago obsolete. You know how to use the latest tech to be effective and can prove it. This isn’t about knowing how to prompt ChatGPT. You’ve internalized AI into how you work. You use Cursor, Claude Code, or Devin daily and know how to hand off as much as you can to them to get stable maintainable working code out. You’ve experimented with AI for design exploration, writing PRDs, generating test cases, perfecting frontends, and automating the boring parts of engineering. You have opinions on when AI helps and when it gets in the way. Most importantly, you can bring this mindset to a team and raise the bar for everyone, not just yourself.
   

  

 Who is this for?
   

  

* You want to cut your teeth as an early engineer on a small but hardworking team.
* You’re not one for defined roles. You’re excited to work across frontend, backend, and AI features.
* You want to be the person who changes how a team builds software, not just ship your own features faster.
* You’re excited to experience personal growth. Our engineers ship faster here than any other job they’ve had. It’s a great career accelerator.


 Who is this not for?
   

  

* You can’t work hard right now. If you have other priorities outside of work, being an early engineer at a startup is probably not the right move.
* You need structure and hand\\-holding. I’m a prior Product Manager at Google and technical founder. I care deeply about product and code quality. But I can’t sit beside you. I’m also doing sales, marketing, customer support, ops, HR, and everything else. I meet with the team daily for code reviews and product questions. Beyond that, you figure it out.
* You’re not excited about what we do. We are building B2B software to help companies automate sales and marketing. Lots of working with customer data, LLMs, integrations, and data fetching.
* You use AI tools superficially, but haven’t thought deeply about how they change the way software gets built. We’re looking for someone who can lead, not just follow.


 What will you do?
   

  

* Ship new features in a fast and stable manner
* Improve existing product to be stable and high quality
* Fix inefficient code, especially around data fetching and API performance
* Architect and implement AI/LLM\\-based features for our platform
* Champion AI\\-assisted workflows across design, PRDs, and engineering, helping the team adopt better practices
* Collaborate on code reviews with AI and people to grow a scalable codebase
* Work directly with the CEO to roadmap new features


**Requirements**
* 2\\+ years of fullstack engineering experience in React, Node.js, or similar (if you’re missing one but willing to learn fast, that’s fine)
* Our stack is React, Node.js, Flask, MongoDB, BigQuery, GCP, and Electron
* Demonstrated AI fluency: Show us how you use AI in your workflow. We use Cursor, Devin, and Claude Code. If you’ve built with similar tools or have strong opinions on AI\\-assisted development, we want to hear it.
* Publicly viewable side projects on GitHub. Please share your GitHub.
* Comfortable working on frontend, backend, and dabbling in LLMs/AI. We’re small, so engineers wear multiple hats.
* Good English communication skills and ability to research problems independently.
* A positive, can\\-do attitude and confidence that you can solve any problem.


 Interview Process
   

  

* 15 min initial phone interview for introductions
* 45\\-60 min live coding interview on Zoom \\- old school algorithms
* 45 min teach me how to use Claude Code, Cursor, etc to build a small feature with me \\- spec it, design it, write it, create test for it
* Reference checks from 1\\-2 previous managers


 We try to keep it as short as possible to be respectful of your time.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/letterdrop","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQF02OYbu_6HoQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630648894606/letterdrop_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=zc9sS-ykdwJp5bderf8ELstXEc8jrtvm_agQJx7ij9I","","","","","","","","","","",""

 If you're ready to make an impact and grow your career, Legion is where you belong. Join us in making hourly work rewarding and fulfilling.
   

  

**BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY**
 There are almost 75 million hourly workers in the United States, representing more than half of the entire workforce. Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees. The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig\\-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options. Legion's mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by Legion's Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously.
   

  

 Legion WFM was built for the cloud with AI at the core and is designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses and meet the needs of today's hourly employees. Our team is composed of dedicated individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, globally distributed across all time zones.
