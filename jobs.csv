**Job Description**
**Software Engineer (AI, Robotics \\& Intelligent Systems)**
 We are looking for an AI/Robotics Engineer who can build real\\-world, production\\-ready intelligent systems—not just research models. This role is at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, deep learning, simulation, and large\\-scale software engineering.
   

  

 You will help develop the AI layer for next\\-generation autonomous home/space intelligence systems.
   

  

 This is a high\\-bar role requiring strong fundamentals in algorithms, systems, perception, and deployment, along with the ability to design and implement end\\-to\\-end intelligent behaviours.
   

  

**What You Will Do**
* Design \\& implement robust AI models for perception, decision\\-making, and robotics intelligence (CV, multimodal, RL, tracking, detection, mapping).
* Build production\\-grade modules for robotics, simulation, and real\\-time inference.
* Implement scalable pipelines for model training, evaluation, deployment, and optimization.
* Work across layers — AI models, robotics controls, cloud inference, embedded execution.
* Integrate AI with sensor inputs (RGB, depth, IMU, structured\\-light, etc.) and actuators.
* Develop algorithms for localization, mapping, planning, and interaction in real\\-world settings.
* Build reusable internal libraries and frameworks for inference and evaluation.
* Collaborate with global teams (AI, robotics, systems, cloud, UX) to ship production features.


**Required Qualifications**
* Masters or PhD in CS, Robotics, AI, Machine Learning, or related field.
* 3\\+ years hands\\-on experience in robotics, computer vision, deep learning, or intelligent systems.
* Strong coding skills in Python and C\\+\\+ (C\\# bonus).
* Experience building and deploying models using PyTorch / TensorFlow / TFLite.
* Strong foundational knowledge in:


 ✔ perception algorithms
   

  

 ✔ sensor fusion
   

  

 ✔ kinematics \\& robotics fundamentals
   

  

 ✔ geometric reasoning
   

  

 ✔ classical CV \\+ DL\\-based CV
   

  

* Solid understanding of system\\-level fundamentals — performance, memory, latency, and secure model execution.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Experience with ROS / ROS2, simulation tools (Gazebo, Isaac, Unity\\-based sims).


**Knowledge Of**
* SLAM / Visual Odometry
* Path planning (A\\*, RRT, MPC, graph\\-based methods)
* Tracking, detection, segmentation pipelines
* Experience deploying AI models into edge/embedded systems.
* Experience working with Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, microservices.
* Ability to write clean, maintainable, production\\-grade code—not just prototype notebooks.
* Understanding of distributed training, model quantization, and optimization.


**Candidates Who**
**Who Will Succeed in This Role**
 ✔ Think in systems — model → algorithm → real\\-world execution.
   

  

 ✔ Can build deployable, not just experimental ML/CV code.
   

  

 ✔ Can reason clearly through robotics and vision problems.
   

  

 ✔ Communicate their approach while coding and debugging.
   

  

 ✔ Have experience shipping models in real\\-world robotics or intelligent devices.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://in.linkedin.com/company/sourcingxpress","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQH8p15unSQuNg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1726488435665/sourcingxpress_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=iFtAwYhOzhMZtNarkze-r6fDB-RFk6LFqh98zidvhgo","","","","","","","","","","",""
