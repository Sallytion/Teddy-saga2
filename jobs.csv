 Key job responsibilities
   

  

 As an SDET driving the creation of next\\-generation LLM\\-based evaluation systems for Alexa\\+, you’ll design and build the frameworks that define how conversational intelligence is measured determining whether millions of daily interactions feel accurate, natural, and human\\-centered. Your work goes far beyond binary pass/fail tests: you’ll engineer automated systems that assess accuracy, reasoning depth, tone, and responsiveness across multimodal, context\\-rich conversations.
   

  

 In this role, traditional testing boundaries dissolve. You’ll evaluate not just functional correctness, but whether the AI’s responses are contextually relevant, emotionally aligned, and conversationally fluent. Your systems will measure everything from factual accuracy and task completion to subtler attributes like dialog flow, personality coherence, and graceful curtailment. Partnering closely with scientists and engineers, you’ll automate the detection of conversational regressions identifying hallucinations, degraded reasoning, or misaligned tones before they reach customers. You’ll leverage prompt\\-driven evaluation pipelines, LLM\\-as\\-a\\-Judge (LLMaaJ) frameworks, and reference\\-based validation to ensure assessments remain consistent, explainable, and scalable across model versions and releases.
   

  

 You’ll also collaborate with prompt engineers, model developers, and product teams to establish robust, category\\-specific testing methodologies—from quick one\\-shot actions and task fulfillment to multi\\-turn dialogues and creative, open\\-ended interactions. Through your work, evaluation evolves from a quality gate into a self\\-improving assessment frameworks —one that learns, adapts, and ensures every voice interaction feels naturally conversational.

* 4\\+ years of experience as an SDET, Software Engineer, or QA Automation Engineer
* Proficiency in at least one programming language (e.g., Java, Python, or JavaScript)

The Platform Infrastructure teams enable Auth0 engineers to move faster by giving them tools to easily build, deploy and manage their services on AWS and Azure. This is a role with a huge impact. You will get to work with engineers throughout the organization and what you build will be a foundational piece of the infrastructure that allows Auth0 to scale for years to come.
   

  

 The Platform Build Services team is responsible for designing and developing the entire Continuous Integration (CI) system. Our primary output is the set of modular, standardized build stages and services that define how all code is tested, packaged, and secured. As a Senior Software Engineer, you will design, implement, and own the delivery of key components and features for modular unified build stages and services, addressing scaling and architectural challenges to accelerate developer workflows across the organization.
   

  

**You will:**
* Design and implement features for major components of the CI and Artifact Management platform, contributing to the overall architectural strategy.
* Proactively investigate and resolve deep\\-seated system issues. Coach and mentor peers on advanced systems, debugging complex distributed failures, and demonstrating the proactive self\\-unblocking required to succeed in our highly complex system.
* Serve as a technical resource for the team. Take ownership of complex build performance and scaling bottlenecks (e.g., dependency resolution speed, Monorepo segmentation) and deliver robust, highly performant solutions.
* Implement complex, reusable Unified Build Stages and Services for critical functions, including security scanning, automated testing orchestration, and standardized packaging/versioning.
* Collaborate with Product, Platform, Security, and Quality Engineering teams. You will contribute to establishing technical standards and ensure complex requirements are integrated seamlessly into the modular stages.
* Maintain and improve the operational health of the entire CI system, including high availability, scaling optimizations of the Build Infrastructure (build agents, source control integration, etc.).
* Execute cost optimization efforts across both the build compute systems and the artifact management storage to ensure efficiency at scale.
* Partner with Security Engineering to integrate robust security scanning, vulnerability remediation, and guardrail integrations into both the CI process and artifact handling.
* Contribute to technical excellence by following engineering best practices, participating in architectural reviews, and implementing the extensibility mechanisms (plugins, custom runners) for the CI platform.
* Participate in the team's on\\-call rotation when production incidents require build support.


**You might be a good fit if you:**
* Have 5\\+ years of experience, with a strong track record in platform or infrastructure roles focused on developing large\\-scale CI/Build Systems and Artifact/Package Management Platforms.
* Possess a strong, practical expertise in CI system architecture with a proven ability to implement and maintain modular build stages, build agent provisioning, and centralized artifact registry solutions.
* Have strong technical proficiency in Golang (or similar systems language) for tooling development.
* Have advanced knowledge of cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure) and Infrastructure\\-as\\-Code (Terraform) at scale.
* Have a deep understanding of Kubernetes and containerization principles relevant to build execution.
* Tend to deliver work incrementally to get feedback and iterate over solutions.
* Have a relentless passion for ownership, accountability, and diving into complexity to deliver highly reliable and performant systems.
