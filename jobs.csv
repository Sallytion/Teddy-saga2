* Mentor and review the work of SDE I engineers, helping them grow in technical expertise.
* Take initiative to improve overall system architecture, scalability, and reliability.
* Exercise ownership by challenging trade\\-offs between speed and reliability when building solutions (“pulling the Andon cord”).


**Education \\& Experience**
- 2–5 years of experience developing cloud\\-based software services with a strong understanding of design for scalability, performance, and reliability.

- 2\\+ years of hands\\-on experience deploying and optimizing AI/ML solutions in production environments.

- Education: BTech or Equivalent 4yr degree in Computer Science/Engineering (Tier 1/Tier 2 institutes such as IIT/NIT preferred, but not required).
