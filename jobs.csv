 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea.

**About us:**
**Nexstem** 
 is building the Human Body API — a non\\-invasive technology that reads and interprets brain and
   

  

 body signals in real time. Founded in 2020, we create biosignal\\-powered infrastructure enabling applications
   

  

 across health, performance, research, and human–computer interaction. Backed by global partners and
   

  

 recognized by leading platforms, we’re making the human body machine\\-readable and accessible to the
   

  

 world.
   

  

**Role: Principal Architect Engineer — Systems, Compiler \\& OS\\-Level**
 Location: Bangalore
   

  

**About the Role:**
 As part of our mission to democratize neurotechnology, we are seeking a Principal Architect Engineer to
   

  

 lead the design of performance\\-critical, low\\-level system software that sits close to our hardware stack and
   

  

 powers the real\\-time Human Body API. This role is ideal for someone who has deep expertise in C\\+\\+ systems
   

  

 programming, OS/kernel fundamentals, compiler/toolchain awareness, and hardware–software integration,
   

  

 and who thrives at the intersection of neuroscience, embedded systems, and scalable real\\-time computing.
   

  

 As Principal Architect Engineer, you will architect, implement, and optimize the core system layer from device
   

  

 drivers and real\\-time data pipelines to system services and API abstractions.
   

  

**You will work across:**
* Compiler and toolchain optimization
* OS\\-level and kernel subsystems
* Real\\-time signal acquisition
* High\\-performance C\\+\\+ runtimes
