 Every company in the world runs payroll. But the rails underneath it haven’t changed since the 1970s.
   

  

 Toku is building what comes next \\- infrastructure that makes payroll work the way the internet does: instantly, globally, and without unnecessary friction.
   

  

 ‍
   

  

 We enable companies to pay teams in stablecoins, fiat, or tokens \\- without switching systems, retraining staff, or giving up compliance. With one API, Toku connects into platforms like ADP, Gusto, or Workday, and upgrades the back end to move money in seconds instead of days.
   

  

 We're building the future of payroll and we're just getting started.

 Engineering Team \\- Who We Are
   

  

 We’re an early, fast‑moving team that ships with care. We work closely with customers, value pragmatic engineering, clear documentation and keep reliability, correctness and security front and center.
   

  

 The Role
   

  

 You’ll own the core product areas end‑to‑end: from scoping, technical design to build, launch, and iteration. You’ll collaborate with operations and product teams on decisions and ship things balancing speed with sound engineering. If you want broad ownership and immediate user impact, you’ll fit right in.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Ship user‑facing features across the stack with short feedback loops
* Turn customer problems into simple and clear product solutions
* Write robust, type‑safe, well‑tested code and stable APIs, keep docs and observability healthy
* Raise the bar on engineering practices: PR reviews, automated testing, and robust CI/CD
* Proactively identify opportunities to improve existing practices and uphold Toku’s high technical quality bar
* Anticipate edge cases, flag blockers early in the process, drive incidents to root cause, and prevent regressions
* Lead feature work from PRD, design doc (RFC) to rollout: data models, API contracts, and UI flows
* Use AI tools to accelerate development, testing, and documentation


**Requirements**
* 3\\+ years building and operating production web apps end\\-to\\-end
* Strong proficiency in TypeScript and JavaScript
* Frontend knowledge: React or Next.js, performance, accessibility and testing fundamentals
* Backend knowledge: Node.js with Express (or similar), Next js API routes, REST, JWT/OAuth, webhooks, background jobs
* Database: Postgres (or other SQL based DBs), schema design, transactions, migrations, and basic performance tuning
* DevEx and Infra: Knowledge of Git/GitHub, CI/CD, Docker; environment/secrets hygiene
* Observability: Experience with popular observability tools (for eg. LogRocket, New Relic, Sentry)
* Good problem solving and communication skills
* Ability to pick up unfamiliar tech fast and execute if required in some scenarios
* Product mindset: clarify ambiguity quickly and slice scope to deliver outcomes
* Code quality: clear abstractions, type safety, tests
* Ownership: you like taking work from 0→1→10 and closing the loop with users
* Hands‑on with AI‑assisted development (for eg. Copilot, Cursor, Devin). Experience with Cursor is a plus, we use it as a team and are open to adopting new tools
