 About the Project
   

 We're at the exciting ground floor of a new, session\\-based multiplayer title built in Unity. Our project is a unique take on asymmetrical gameplay, blending deep strategic elements with moments of intense, fast\\-paced action. We're building a complex world with a high degree of player interaction and dynamic elements that challenge players to think and act differently depending on their role.
   

  

 💡 We are a startup with a small, dedicated team, so every member has a significant impact on the final product. We're looking for someone who thrives in an independent, fast\\-paced environment and is comfortable wearing multiple hats when needed.
   

  

 Your Role \\& Responsibilities
   

 As the sole multiplayer developer, you’ll be responsible for building the entire multiplayer infrastructure from scratch, including:
   

  

 Building the main network system for our 8–12 player game.
   

  

 Creating a system that can support two distinct gameplay modes running simultaneously.
   

  

 Syncing 200\\+ background AI characters across all clients without causing lag.
   

  

 Implementing effective lag compensation and prediction to ensure a fair and responsive experience.

 Strong knowledge of multiplayer development, preferably with authoritative server architecture.
   

  

 Solid grasp of networking concepts and real\\-time synchronization challenges.
   

  

 Ability to work fully independently — you will be the only multiplayer specialist on the team.
   

  

 You must be able to design, build, and debug complex multiplayer systems without external guidance or training.
   

  

 Your own development PC and reliable internet connection are required — we do not provide hardware or network support.
   

  

 Proficiency in writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code following SOLID principles and utilizing proper design patterns.
   

  

 A strong portfolio and GitHub profile demonstrating relevant multiplayer experience (both are required for consideration).
   

  

 Bonus Points (Nice\\-to\\-Haves)
   

  

 You've shipped or significantly contributed to a multiplayer game with similar technical complexity.
