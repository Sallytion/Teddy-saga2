**Hey, Hi, Hello! 👋** 




  





 My name is Connor Wilson. I’m the Founder and CEO of Pilot. 
 



  





 We’re a travel app company with the mission of helping people like you around the world have an awesome time and make memories offline, so you and others can live a happier, more fulfilling life. 
 



  





**But before I talk about us, I want to talk about you.** 




  





 If you’re reading this job description, you’re probably either exploring new challenges or simply curious about a better fit…
 



  





 …because whether you realize it or not,
 **you’re not as happy as you could be** 
 . 
 



  





 There could be a lot of reasons for this. Here’s a few:
 


* 🚩You’re overworked and/or underappreciated
* 🚩You lack faith, trust or closeness to your colleagues or leaders
* 🚩Your company is bureaucratic, lacks transparency, or makes siloed top\\-down decisions
* 🚩You lack autonomy, freedom, or potential for growth
* 🚩You’re bored, aren’t learning or being challenged, or don’t care about what you’re working on or what your company does or who it serves
* 🚩Your company has an unhealthy/undesirable culture



  





 We’ve been there. 
 



  





 I’m here to tell you
 **it doesn’t have to be that way.** 




  





 You know it doesn’t. 
 



  





 Remember that project back in school or earlier in your life/career that you really enjoyed or got super passionate about? That didn’t feel like work did it? It was fun. Well your job shouldn’t either. Especially considering we spend most of our lives at our jobs.
 



  





 Is your current company going to give you that?
 



  





**Why you should work at Pilot 🙋‍♀️** 




 If you think you’d like working at a company whose very purpose is to give you and others the absolute best life possible, in the most fun way possible, working on cool things with cool people, to help people have an awesome time and make memories…
 



  





 …well then Pilot might just be the place for you. 
 



  





 It’s embedded into who we are. That’s why we have a public 23\\-page culture code. Read it here to see if we vibe: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gadFcFo79JWtVyI7n1FMj4wYePfzirAvZ1\\_kS7d2WnQ/edit?usp\\=sharing
 



  
 



**At Pilot you’ll get…** 



* 🌴
 **A 4 day workweek if you complete your full\\-time work before Friday, with unlimited paid vacation** 
 (with manager approval/coordination) and get compensated competitively through salary and stock options so you’ll own your work. For this role that means: ₹10L – ₹20L • 0\\.05% – 0\\.15% equity via stock options
* 🙌
 **Near total autonomy and freedom.** 
 You pick your own projects, set your own goals, and work the hours you want, where you want, with who you want. Our team travels all over the world \\- you can too.
* 🎊
 **Work with people who all want to be your friend** 
 (we actually hang out). Our team is incredibly talented, but we value humility.
* 🤓
 **Leaders who own their mistakes** 
 (yes, that includes me), actively seek feedback to identify \\& solve them, and are pretty experienced. You can learn more about me here: https://www.connorjwilson.com. TL’DR: this isn’t my first startup; my last tech startup sold for 8\\-figures after we grew it for 3 years without investors, reaching $3\\.5 million in annual recurring revenue.
* 🧪
 **Decisions based on data** 
 , not based on that Linkedin post your manager saw that one time. Everyone at any every level is empowered to make decisions because we share everything and have a culture of transparency, trust, and experimentation.
* ✈️
 **It’s travel, so it’s super fun. It’s a startup, so it’s super challenging** 
 with a huge upside.
 **And, it’s social impact focused** 
 , so you’ll actually be helping people, not just maximizing profits.
* 🌎
 **We’re proud to have a diverse team** 
 , with plans to become a B\\-Corp eventually.
* ⭐
 **We also have some great employer reviews** 
 here: glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Pilot\\-Reviews\\-E3311415\\.htm



  





**“Okay, but what even is Pilot?” 🤔** 




 Great question. Glad you asked.
 



  





 We’re building Pilot to be a Collaborative Travel Hub, powered by AI, to help groups (of 2 or more) discover, plan, book, and share experiences with the people they care about. A shareable platform like Notion or Google Docs with social functionality, not a social network. 
 



  




* 🎓 We’re a Next Canada Accelerated Startup.
* 🌱 We incorporated on Sixto de Mayo 2020\\. We missed Cinco de Mayo by one day and are still bitter about it. We spent the time since then iterating towards our current platform. It wasn’t until 2022 that we had a team of full\\-time staff, as I had to work at the acquirer of my previous company after the sale for a bit.
* 💸 We’ve raised over $2M to date
* 😎 Today we’re a team of 10\\.
* 🏆 Our product is live publicly (try it at pilotplans.com) \\- we started with our trip planner, and have been building out the “explore” and bookings side of the app for the last year or so.
* 🎉 Over 30,000 people have signed up to Pilot
* ⌚ And it seems to be working! After 10 minutes of planning, 60% of people say they’d never go back to their old way. Activation and retention rates are 2\\-3x the travel industry average.
* **🚀 We’re growing fast** 
 : we recently became a certified Google Travel Partner to distribute 2M\\+ stays. If we can pull it off, that means millions a year in annual revenue. We’ve got a clear path to this high level of distribution, something most startups struggle to ever find.



  





 So that’s us. Feel free to check out the team at pilotplans.com/careers 
 



  





**The role. The goal. 🛣️** 




 Here’s what we’re looking for from you:
 



  





 It’s very simple. We want someone to help us build the back\\-end of our web and mobile applications and system architecture/infrastructure, as well as support the front\\-end development.
 



  





**What you’ll be doing and learning 🧑‍💻** 




 These are entirely subject to change based on what gets the most results, but here goes:
 



  




* Build software with the our end user's experience as a priority
* Build software that is positioned for intense growth, keeping scalability, maintainability, and extensibility in mind
* Work cross functionally with our design, growth, and product teams to establish and execute our roadmap
* Maintain ownership of code through its lifecycle from design to deployment
* Determine the strategic and tactical direction of the back\\-end architecture and middle\\-ware services
* Code, test, document and deliver highly scalable and reliable platform services and components that create the foundation of the core web application platform with cross\\-browser compatibility, accessibility and search engine optimization.
* Suggest and use AI tools, cloud\\-based technologies/services to more efficiently improve the product stability, performance and quality.
* Continually seeking ways to optimize and streamline Pilot’s web application platform to facilitate a seamless implementation experience for our developers and partners
* Lead projects as part of an agile\\-like development process, including scoping, technical research, prioritization, coding, testing, debugging, code reviews, maintenance and support.

**Hey, Hi, Hello! 👋** 




  





 My name is Connor Wilson. I’m the Founder and CEO of Pilot. 
 



  





 We’re a travel app company with the mission of helping people like you around the world have an awesome time and make memories offline, so you and others can live a happier, more fulfilling life. 
 



  





**But before I talk about us, I want to talk about you.** 




  





 If you’re reading this job description, you’re probably either exploring new challenges or simply curious about a better fit…
 



  





 …because whether you realize it or not,
 **you’re not as happy as you could be** 
 . 
 



  





 There could be a lot of reasons for this. Here’s a few:
 


* 🚩You’re overworked and/or underappreciated
* 🚩You lack faith, trust or closeness to your colleagues or leaders
* 🚩Your company is bureaucratic, lacks transparency, or makes siloed top\\-down decisions
* 🚩You lack autonomy, freedom, or potential for growth
* 🚩You’re bored, aren’t learning or being challenged, or don’t care about what you’re working on or what your company does or who it serves
* 🚩Your company has an unhealthy/undesirable culture



  





 We’ve been there. 
 



  





 I’m here to tell you
 **it doesn’t have to be that way.** 




  





 You know it doesn’t. 
 



  





 Remember that project back in school or earlier in your life/career that you really enjoyed or got super passionate about? That didn’t feel like work did it? It was fun. Well your job shouldn’t either. Especially considering we spend most of our lives at our jobs.
 



  





 Is your current company going to give you that?
 



  





**Why you should work at Pilot 🙋‍♀️** 




 If you think you’d like working at a company whose very purpose is to give you and others the absolute best life possible, in the most fun way possible, working on cool things with cool people, to help people have an awesome time and make memories…
 



  





 …well then Pilot might just be the place for you. 
 



  





 It’s embedded into who we are. That’s why we have a public 23\\-page culture code. Read it here to see if we vibe: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gadFcFo79JWtVyI7n1FMj4wYePfzirAvZ1\\_kS7d2WnQ/edit?usp\\=sharing
 



  
 



**At Pilot you’ll get…** 



* 🌴
 **A 4 day workweek if you complete your full\\-time work before Friday, with unlimited paid vacation** 
 (with manager approval/coordination) and get compensated competitively through salary and stock options so you’ll own your work. For this role that means: ₹10L – ₹20L • 0\\.05% – 0\\.15% equity via stock options
* 🙌
 **Near total autonomy and freedom.** 
 You pick your own projects, set your own goals, and work the hours you want, where you want, with who you want. Our team travels all over the world \\- you can too.
* 🎊
 **Work with people who all want to be your friend** 
 (we actually hang out). Our team is incredibly talented, but we value humility.
* 🤓
 **Leaders who own their mistakes** 
 (yes, that includes me), actively seek feedback to identify \\& solve them, and are pretty experienced. You can learn more about me here: https://www.connorjwilson.com. TL’DR: this isn’t my first startup; my last tech startup sold for 8\\-figures after we grew it for 3 years without investors, reaching $3\\.5 million in annual recurring revenue.
* 🧪
 **Decisions based on data** 
 , not based on that Linkedin post your manager saw that one time. Everyone at any every level is empowered to make decisions because we share everything and have a culture of transparency, trust, and experimentation.
* ✈️
 **It’s travel, so it’s super fun. It’s a startup, so it’s super challenging** 
 with a huge upside.
 **And, it’s social impact focused** 
 , so you’ll actually be helping people, not just maximizing profits.
* 🌎
 **We’re proud to have a diverse team** 
 , with plans to become a B\\-Corp eventually.
* ⭐
 **We also have some great employer reviews** 
 here: glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Pilot\\-Reviews\\-E3311415\\.htm



  





**“Okay, but what even is Pilot?” 🤔** 




 Great question. Glad you asked.
 



  





 We’re building Pilot to be a Collaborative Travel Hub, powered by AI, to help groups (of 2 or more) discover, plan, book, and share experiences with the people they care about. A shareable platform like Notion or Google Docs with social functionality, not a social network. 
 



  




* 🎓 We’re a Next Canada Accelerated Startup.
* 🌱 We incorporated on Sixto de Mayo 2020\\. We missed Cinco de Mayo by one day and are still bitter about it. We spent the time since then iterating towards our current platform. It wasn’t until 2022 that we had a team of full\\-time staff, as I had to work at the acquirer of my previous company after the sale for a bit.
* 💸 We’ve raised over $2M to date
* 😎 Today we’re a team of 10\\.
* 🏆 Our product is live publicly (try it at pilotplans.com) \\- we started with our trip planner, and have been building out the “explore” and bookings side of the app for the last year or so.
* 🎉 Over 30,000 people have signed up to Pilot
* ⌚ And it seems to be working! After 10 minutes of planning, 60% of people say they’d never go back to their old way. Activation and retention rates are 2\\-3x the travel industry average.
* **🚀 We’re growing fast** 
 : we recently became a certified Google Travel Partner to distribute 2M\\+ stays. If we can pull it off, that means millions a year in annual revenue. We’ve got a clear path to this high level of distribution, something most startups struggle to ever find.



  





 So that’s us. Feel free to check out the team at pilotplans.com/careers 
 



  





**The role. The goal. 🛣️** 




 Here’s what we’re looking for from you:
 



  





 It’s very simple. We want someone to help us build the back\\-end of our web and mobile applications and system architecture/infrastructure, as well as support the front\\-end development.
 



  





**What you’ll be doing and learning 🧑‍💻** 




 These are entirely subject to change based on what gets the most results, but here goes:
 



  




* Build software with the our end user's experience as a priority
* Build software that is positioned for intense growth, keeping scalability, maintainability, and extensibility in mind
* Work cross functionally with our design, growth, and product teams to establish and execute our roadmap
* Maintain ownership of code through its lifecycle from design to deployment
* Determine the strategic and tactical direction of the back\\-end architecture and middle\\-ware services
* Code, test, document and deliver highly scalable and reliable platform services and components that create the foundation of the core web application platform with cross\\-browser compatibility, accessibility and search engine optimization.
* Suggest and use AI tools, cloud\\-based technologies/services to more efficiently improve the product stability, performance and quality.
* Continually seeking ways to optimize and streamline Pilot’s web application platform to facilitate a seamless implementation experience for our developers and partners

**Hey, Hi, Hello! 👋** 




  





 My name is Connor Wilson. I’m the Founder and CEO of Pilot. 
 



  





 We’re a travel app company with the mission of helping people like you around the world have an awesome time and make memories offline, so you and others can live a happier, more fulfilling life. 
 



  





**But before I talk about us, I want to talk about you.** 




  





 If you’re reading this job description, you’re probably either exploring new challenges or simply curious about a better fit…
 



  





 …because whether you realize it or not,
 **you’re not as happy as you could be** 
 . 
 



  





 There could be a lot of reasons for this. Here’s a few:
 


* 🚩You’re overworked and/or underappreciated
* 🚩You lack faith, trust or closeness to your colleagues or leaders
* 🚩Your company is bureaucratic, lacks transparency, or makes siloed top\\-down decisions
* 🚩You lack autonomy, freedom, or potential for growth
* 🚩You’re bored, aren’t learning or being challenged, or don’t care about what you’re working on or what your company does or who it serves
* 🚩Your company has an unhealthy/undesirable culture



  





 We’ve been there. 
 



  





 I’m here to tell you
 **it doesn’t have to be that way.** 




  





 You know it doesn’t. 
 



  





 Remember that project back in school or earlier in your life/career that you really enjoyed or got super passionate about? That didn’t feel like work did it? It was fun. Well your job shouldn’t either. Especially considering we spend most of our lives at our jobs.
 



  





 Is your current company going to give you that?
 



  





**Why you should work at Pilot 🙋‍♀️** 




 If you think you’d like working at a company whose very purpose is to give you and others the absolute best life possible, in the most fun way possible, working on cool things with cool people, to help people have an awesome time and make memories…
 



  





 …well then Pilot might just be the place for you.

* 🌴
 **A 4 day workweek if you complete your full\\-time work before Friday, with unlimited paid vacation** 
 (with manager approval/coordination) and get compensated competitively through salary and stock options so you’ll own your work. For this role that means: ₹10L – ₹20L • 0\\.05% – 0\\.15% equity via stock options
* 🙌
 **Near total autonomy and freedom.** 
 You pick your own projects, set your own goals, and work the hours you want, where you want, with who you want. Our team travels all over the world \\- you can too.
* 🎊
 **Work with people who all want to be your friend** 
 (we actually hang out). Our team is incredibly talented, but we value humility.
* 🤓
 **Leaders who own their mistakes** 
 (yes, that includes me), actively seek feedback to identify \\& solve them, and are pretty experienced. You can learn more about me here: https://www.connorjwilson.com. TL’DR: this isn’t my first startup; my last tech startup sold for 8\\-figures after we grew it for 3 years without investors, reaching $3\\.5 million in annual recurring revenue.
* 🧪
 **Decisions based on data** 
 , not based on that Linkedin post your manager saw that one time. Everyone at any every level is empowered to make decisions because we share everything and have a culture of transparency, trust, and experimentation.
* ✈️
 **It’s travel, so it’s super fun. It’s a startup, so it’s super challenging** 
 with a huge upside.
 **And, it’s social impact focused** 
 , so you’ll actually be helping people, not just maximizing profits.
* 🌎
 **We’re proud to have a diverse team**

**“Okay, but what even is Pilot?” 🤔** 




 Great question. Glad you asked.
 



  





 We’re building Pilot to be a Collaborative Travel Hub, powered by AI, to help groups (of 2 or more) discover, plan, book, and share experiences with the people they care about. A shareable platform like Notion or Google Docs with social functionality, not a social network. 
 



  




* 🎓 We’re a Next Canada Accelerated Startup.
* 🌱 We incorporated on Sixto de Mayo 2020\\. We missed Cinco de Mayo by one day and are still bitter about it. We spent the time since then iterating towards our current platform. It wasn’t until 2022 that we had a team of full\\-time staff, as I had to work at the acquirer of my previous company after the sale for a bit.
* 💸 We’ve raised over $2M to date
* 😎 Today we’re a team of 10\\.
* 🏆 Our product is live publicly (try it at pilotplans.com) \\- we started with our trip planner, and have been building out the “explore” and bookings side of the app for the last year or so.
* 🎉 Over 30,000 people have signed up to Pilot
* ⌚ And it seems to be working! After 10 minutes of planning, 60% of people say they’d never go back to their old way. Activation and retention rates are 2\\-3x the travel industry average.
* **🚀 We’re growing fast** 
 : we recently became a certified Google Travel Partner to distribute 2M\\+ stays. If we can pull it off, that means millions a year in annual revenue. We’ve got a clear path to this high level of distribution, something most startups struggle to ever find.
