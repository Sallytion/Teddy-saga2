 Location: Hybrid — Hyderabad, India Department: Product Engineering Reports to: Software Engineering Manager / Director of Engineering
   

  

**About The Role**
 We’re looking for a QA Automation Engineer III who believes that quality isn’t a final step — it’s built in from day one. You’ll join an empowered product team and own the test strategy, automation architecture, and quality signals that ensure fast, confident releases.
   

  

 This isn’t a “tester” role. It’s a builder’s role — creating tools, pipelines, and frameworks that let the whole team ship safely at speed.
   

  

 What You’ll Do
   

  

* Design and build automation frameworks: Own UI and API automation using tools like Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium, with scripting in JavaScript or TypeScript.
* Shift left on quality: Collaborate with developers and product early in the PDLC to define acceptance criteria and edge cases.
* Integrate testing into delivery: Automate pipelines for continuous testing in CI/CD environments (GitHub Actions or Jenkins).
* Work across stacks: Test Angular front\\-ends, AWS Lambda services, and REST/GraphQL APIs.
* Champion feature flag testing: Partner with engineering to validate progressive delivery using GrowthBook or LaunchDarkly.
* Own observability of quality: Track reliability, defect trends, and release confidence metrics.
* Mentor and guide: Coach other engineers on automation best practices and test\\-driven development.


 What You Bring
   

  

* 5–8 years of experience in QA automation or software engineering in agile product teams.
* Strong English communication skills — clear, concise, and collaborative across time zones.
* Expertise in writing automated tests for web applications (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, or similar).
* Solid programming skills in TypeScript or JavaScript (required); Java experience a plus.
* Hands\\-on experience testing AWS Lambda or serverless backends.
* Understanding of feature flags, progressive delivery, and CI/CD integration.
* Familiarity with Angular apps, browser automation, and API validation.
* Ability to create and maintain test data and mock services.
* Passion for root\\-cause analysis and preventing defects over detecting them.


 Nice to Have
   

  

* Experience with GitHub Actions, Cloudflare Workers, or AWS Step Functions in test pipelines.
* Exposure to performance and load testing (JMeter, k6, or Locust).
* Familiarity with GrowthBook, LaunchDarkly, or Split.io.
* Knowledge of monitoring tools like Datadog, Grafana, or New Relic for release validation.
* Prior experience mentoring junior QA engineers or leading small automation initiatives.


 How We Work
   

  

 We believe in empowered teams — not handoffs. QA, engineering, and product collaborate from day one to define and deliver value.
   

  

 Quality is a shared responsibility, and automation is the enabler that makes rapid delivery possible.
   

  

 You’ll have the autonomy to shape how we test, the mastery to build world\\-class automation, and the purpose of seeing your work translate into confidence for the entire team.
