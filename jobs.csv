 We started in 2012, in an era when due diligence was still largely manual, opaque, and inconsistent. Financial institutions needed reliable intelligence but faced a frustrating choice: slow, expensive boutique firms or fast, superficial automated checks. We saw an opportunity to bring the investigative rigor of boutique firms to scale through technology.
   

  

 From our early days conducting background checks for commercial real estate lenders and private equity deals to building a best\\-in\\-class portfolio monitoring platform and what is arguably the industry's most advanced investigations platform, our vision remains unchanged: help businesses see clearly through complexity and make decisions with confidence.
   

  

**Where We Are Today**
* Based in New York City with global operations spanning the US, Romania, India, and soon\\-to\\-be London
* 25,000\\+ investigations annually across six continents

* Backed by Sunstone Partners, a leading private equity firm supporting our next phase of growth
* Trusted by top\\-tier financial institutions, private equity firms, and Fortune 500 companies


 Vcheck has a talented and collaborative team.

 We're building something different: a comprehensive portfolio risk management platform that operates with the rigor of a top\\-tier investigative shop and the efficiency of a modern technology company.
