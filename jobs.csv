You take ownership of features from ideation to deployment, and you play a key role in maintaining the health and reliability of the systems you build. You understand the “why” behind the work — connecting technical decisions to customer outcomes and business value. You demonstrate good judgment when working through ambiguity and elevate the quality of the systems and team around you.
 





 You’re responsible for designing and delivering moderately complex features and services, often navigating evolving requirements and unclear boundaries. You understand how services fit together and are comfortable working across APIs, databases, cloud infrastructure, and front\\-end components. You contribute actively to design discussions, identify opportunities for simplification, and make pragmatic choices that balance speed and sustainability. You support a culture of code quality, mentorship, and operational ownership.
 





 You are expected to use AI\\-powered development tools to improve your productivity, especially for repetitive, boilerplate, or testing\\-related tasks. You incorporate these tools thoughtfully and are responsible for validating the accuracy and security of the output. You are fully accountable for ensuring your code is thoroughly tested and production\\-ready — including unit, integration, end\\-to\\-end, and any needed manual validation. You help maintain the health of our pipelines, observability tooling, and engineering process.
 





 You also begin to work more directly with product and business stakeholders — particularly on features or flows that touch customer\\-facing tools or internal operations. You help clarify scope, translate user needs into technical solutions, and provide insight into trade\\-offs and timelines. You represent engineering in cross\\-functional conversations and take responsibility for delivering outcomes, not just output.
 




  





**What you’ll do:** 



* Own end\\-to\\-end delivery of features or services, including design, implementation, testing, deployment, and operations.
* Use AI\\-based development tools to improve speed, reduce boilerplate, and boost development quality.
* Collaborate with product, design, and business stakeholders to scope and prioritize work that delivers impact.
* Identify edge cases and failure scenarios, and build systems that handle them gracefully.
* Participate in and lead technical discussions, providing feedback on design and implementation.
* Write clear, well\\-tested, and maintainable code — and help others do the same.
* Take full responsibility for testing your changes at all levels (unit, integration, e2e, and manual).
* Monitor and maintain services in production, contributing to on\\-call rotations and incident response.
* Continuously improve code quality, developer tooling, CI/CD pipelines, and engineering processes.
* Mentor early\\-career engineers and help raise the team’s technical bar.



  





**Requirements:** 



* Proficient in Python.
* Solid working knowledge of AWS; expected to independently build, deploy, and debug applications using common services, and contribute to infrastructure and deployment pipelines.
* Experience with distributed systems, RESTful APIs, and full\\-stack development.
* Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring tools, and DevOps best practices.
* Ability to write high\\-quality, testable, and well\\-documented code.
* Comfort using AI development tools thoughtfully and critically.
