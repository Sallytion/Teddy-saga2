 At Agoda, we bridge the world through travel. Our story began in 2005, when two lifelong friends and entrepreneurs, driven by their passion for travel, launched Agoda to make it easier for everyone to explore the world.
   

  

 Today, we are part of Booking Holdings \\[NASDAQ: BKNG], with a diverse team of over 7,000 people from 90 countries, working together in offices around the globe. Every day, we connect people to destinations and experiences, with our great deals across our millions of hotels and holiday properties, flights, and experiences worldwide.
   

  

 No two days are the same at Agoda. Data and technology are at the heart of our culture, fueling our curiosity and innovation. If you’re ready to begin your best journey and help build travel for the world, join us.
   

  

**Get to Know our Team:**
 In Agoda’s Back End Engineering department, we build the scalable, fault\\-tolerant systems and APIs that host our core business logic. Our systems cover all major areas of our business: inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, and more. These mission\\-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state\\-of\\-the\\-art CI/CD and testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self\\-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state\\-of\\-the\\-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Aerospike, and agile development practices. Most importantly though, we hire great people from all around the world and empower them to be successful. Whether it’s building new projects like Flights and Packages or reimagining our existing business, you’ll make a big impact as part of the Back End Engineering team.
   

  

**The Opportunity:**
 Agoda is looking for developers to work on mission critical systems that deal with the designing and development of APIs that serve millions of user search requests a day.
   

  

**In this Role, you'll get to**
* Lead development of features, experiments, technical projects and complex systems
* Be a technical architect, mentor, and driver towards the right technology
* Continue to evolve our architecture and build better software
* Be a major contributor to our agile and scrum practices
* Get involved with software engineering and collaborate with server, other client, and infrastructure technical team members to build the best solution
* Constantly look for ways to improve our products, code\\-base and development practices
* Write great code and help others write great code
* Drive Technical decisions in the organization.


**What You’ll Need To Succeed**
* 7\\+ years’ experience under your belt developing performance\\-critical applications that run in a production environment using Scala, Java or C\\#.
* Experience in leading projects, initiatives and/or teams, with full ownership of the systems involved
* Data platforms like SQL, Cassandra or Hadoop. You understand that different applications have different data requirements
* Good understanding of algorithms and data structures
* Strong coding ability
* You are passionate about the craft of software development and constantly work to improve your knowledge and skills
* Excellent verbal and written English communication skills


**It’s Great If You Have**
* Experience with Scrum/Agile development methodologies
* Experience building large\\-scale distributed products
* Core engineering infrastructure tools like Git for source control, TeamCity for Continuous Integration and Puppet for deployment
* Hands\\-on experience working with technology like queueing systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, MSMQ), Spark, Hadoop, NoSQL (Cassandra, MongoDB), Play framework, Akka library

Artificial intelligence, the dream of computer scientists for over half a century, is no longer science fiction. And in the next few years, it will transform every industry. Soon, self\\-driving cars will reduce congestion and improve road safety. AI travel agents will know your preferences and arrange every detail of your family vacation. And medical instruments will read and understand patient DNA to detect and treat early signs of cancer. Where engines made us stronger and powered the first industrial revolution, AI will make us smarter and power the next. What will make this intelligent industrial revolution possible? A new computing model — GPU deep learning — that enables computers to learn from data and write software that is too complex for people to code.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Study and develop cutting\\-edge techniques in deep learning, graphs, machine learning, and data analytics, and perform in\\-depth analysis and optimization to ensure the best possible performance on current\\- and next\\-generation GPU architectures.
* Work directly with key customers to understand the current and future problems they are solving and provide the best AI solutions using GPUs.
* Collaborate closely with the architecture, research, libraries, tools, and system software teams at NVIDIA to influence the design of next\\-generation architectures, software platforms, and programming models.


**What We Need To See**
* A Masters degree or PhD in an engineering or computer science related discipline or equivalent experience and 2\\+ years of relevant work or research experience.
* Strong knowledge of C/C\\+\\+, software design, programming techniques, and AI algorithms.
* Firsthand work experience with parallel programming, ideally CUDA C/C\\+\\+.
* Strong communication and organization skills, with a logical approach to problem solving, good time management, and task prioritization skills.
* Some travel is required for conferences and for on\\-site visits with developers.


 NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology world’s most desirable employers. We have some of the most forward\\-thinking and hardworking people in the world working for us. Are you a creative and autonomous computer scientist with a genuine passion for parallel computing? If so, we want to hear from you.
