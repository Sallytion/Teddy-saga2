The work is not consumer\\-facing, and most of it is not public. We operate with a high bar for correctness, discretion, and long\\-horizon thinking.
 



  





**Role Description** 




 You will work on backend systems whose primary purpose is to formalize assumptions, constraints, and invariants that govern how internal systems behave.
 



 Rather than focusing on throughput, user\\-facing APIs, or feature delivery, this role is concerned with making implicit logic explicit. The backend systems involved encode rules, constraints, and state transitions that other components rely on but do not redefine. Errors in these systems are not noisy; they are subtle and structural.
 



 The work requires reasoning carefully about how abstract rules are represented in code, how those representations evolve, and how violations are detected or prevented. Much of the complexity lies not in scale, but in precision: small inconsistencies can propagate widely if left unchecked.
 



 The objective is to ensure that backend systems serve as a stable reference layer for correctness, rather than an opaque execution substrate.
 



  





**Responsibilities** 



* **Constraint Encoding:** 
 Translate abstract system rules and assumptions into explicit backend representations.
* **Invariant Enforcement:** 
 Design mechanisms that detect, prevent, or surface violations of core system invariants.
* **State Modeling:** 
 Reason about state transitions, edge cases, and boundary conditions across long\\-lived processes.
* **Interface Discipline:** 
 Define narrow, well\\-specified interfaces that other systems depend on without reinterpretation.
* **Technical Writing:** 
 Document system logic, constraints, and failure cases with precision and minimal ambiguity.



  





**Qualifications** 



* **Education:** 
 Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, or a related field; graduate\\-level training is strongly preferred.
* **Analytical Orientation:** 
 Demonstrated ability to reason formally about systems, rules, and edge cases.
* **Backend Experience:** 
 Experience working on backend systems where correctness was more important than velocity.
* **Abstraction Skill:** 
 Comfort operating at the level of models, representations, and invariants rather than features.
* **Temperament:** 
 Patience for careful work with limited feedback and high downstream impact.","Financial Services","https://www.linkedin.com/company/stealth-mode-startup-company-fintech","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQG7KfC-VZjm3g/company-logo_100_100/B4EZtikqbfJwAU-/0/1766885337567/stealth_mode_startup_company_fintech_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ccgmdMmOEq6wEe3Gl1y8R8S4pTU5t9cH9CmF8DJFkWA","","","","","","","","","","",""
