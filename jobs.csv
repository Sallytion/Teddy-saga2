We’re a unique company that gives you space to fit in and enables you to make use of your skills. Our systems are being used by over 170,000 co\\-workers and serve over 4 billion customers globally!
   

 We’re building demand legend solution as an event\\-driven cloud architecture. There are heaps of challenges in front of us, but we’re prepared and look forward to becoming truly agile with modern architecture – and maybe with your help.
   

 We’re not chasing shareholder value; we want to help the many people to have a better everyday life.
   

 Demand Legend– you might know it, or you might have no clue! Either is fine, as we’ll help you to get an understanding and find your ways around creating, executing, releasing demands. This won’t get boring thanks to the many different flows and integrations in our omni\\-channel setup!
   

 We aim to have driven, empowered agile teams who understand priorities and how to come to agreements with other teams and domains. We’re all in this together and we try to help others and share our knowledge often.
   

 We want to become the best in class – yes, that’s a lofty goal, but why aim for less? If you feel the same then you’ll fit right in, come and help us push boundaries!
   

 We have values and we live them – they’re all important and I’m happy to share them with you in more detail, but these stand out for me: Togetherness, Simplicity, leading by example, and different with a meaning – get in touch and I can explain in detail!

 You always have a big backlog, but you have a good understanding of what adds value now and what can wait, and you can explain your thoughts to others.
   

  

 Below are preferred technical skills:
   

 • Minimum 7 years of professional experience as software engineer with similar level of experience in the specific tech stack for the area.
