**What You'll Achieve**
* You’ll work with a team of engineers and cross\\-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to define a product strategy and drive execution through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance.
* You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more.

At Atlan, we’re changing that. As the world’s first active metadata platform, we help organisations transform data chaos into clarity and seamless collaboration.
   

  

 From Fortune 500 leaders to hyper\\-growth startups, from automotive innovators redefining mobility to healthcare organisations saving lives, and from Wall Street powerhouses to Silicon Valley trailblazers — we empower ambitious teams across industries to unlock the full potential of their data.
   

  

 Recognised as leaders by Gartner and Forrester and backed by Insight Partners, Atlan is at the forefront of reimagining how humans and data work together. Joining us means becoming part of a movement to shape a future where data drives extraordinary outcomes.
   

  

**The Team**
 The Integration Studio team owns Atlan’s entire connector ecosystem — the ingestion pipelines, metadata processing systems, and lineage signals that connect Atlan to the outside world. Today, Atlan supports 80\\+ connectors across databases, data warehouses, BI tools, and enterprise platforms, all built and operated as part of this ecosystem.
   

  

 As Atlan’s adoption scales, this connector ecosystem has evolved into a large\\-scale distributed system: dozens of heterogeneous external sources, continuously running ingestion workflows, increasing run volumes, and downstream dependencies on metadata correctness and lineage trust. Integration Studio is responsible for building, operating, and evolving this system end to end.
   

  

 All connectors at Atlan are built on top of the Apps Framework, which provides the shared execution model and abstractions for how integrations are developed, run, and evolved. Integration Studio works closely with this framework in real\\-world customer and ecosystem scenarios to ensure connectors meet Atlan’s standards for quality, reliability, and scalability.
   

  

 Within Integration Studio, this role focuses on a critical slice of the connector ecosystem where integrations are built and exercised in close collaboration with external partners and ecosystem builders. Work in this area is often directly tied to customer adoption, expansion, and retention, making it a meaningful driver of Atlan’s business outcomes and revenue.
   

  

 As a
 **Senior Software Engineer – Integration Studio** 
 , you’ll work hands\\-on across externally built, co\\-built, and Atlan\\-owned integrations. You’ll contribute production\\-quality code, own long\\-tail and niche connectors, and drive targeted enhancements based on real\\-world usage. You’ll also feed learnings back into the App Framework to improve how integrations are built and operated across the ecosystem.
   

  

 This is a high\\-impact, high\\-judgment role, ideal for engineers who enjoy working on real systems, shipping production code, and operating at the intersection of platform engineering and real\\-world usage.
   

  

**What will you do? 🤔**
* Build and evolve production\\-grade integrations at scale, working across externally built, co\\-built, and Atlan\\-owned connectors using Atlan’s App Framework.
* Use AI\\-assisted development as a first\\-class tool to accelerate coding, debugging, design iteration, and safe evolution of complex integration systems.
* Own high\\-impact connectors and enhancements that directly influence customer adoption, expansion, and retention, prioritizing correctness, reliability, and long\\-term maintainability.
* Synthesize feedback from partner and customer implementations to identify recurring patterns, edge cases, and design gaps — and translate those insights into concrete improvements to connector patterns and the App Framework.
* Work closely with external partners and ecosystem builders on design reviews and technical problem\\-solving, helping integrations succeed in real\\-world, production environments.
* Contribute hands\\-on code to improve scalability, observability, and operability of ingestion workflows and metadata pipelines exercised under real\\-world load.
* Design and debug long\\-running, fault\\-tolerant workflows, working with orchestration systems like Temporal to handle retries, partial failures, and external system variability.
* Raise the engineering bar by championing strong practices around testing, logging, monitoring, and structured debugging across the integration ecosystem.


**What makes you a match? 😍**
* AI\\-native engineering mindset: You actively use AI\\-assisted development as a default — to accelerate coding, understand unfamiliar codebases, debug complex issues, and iterate safely on production systems. You’re excited about shaping how AI changes the way software is built.
* Strong backend engineering experience (5\\+ years): You’ve built and maintained production systems end to end, primarily in Python, and are comfortable owning changes from design through rollout and operation.
* Experience with integrations, ingestion, or data pipelines: You’ve worked on ETL systems, connectors, ingestion pipelines, or API\\-driven integrations where correctness, reliability, and scale matter.
* High\\-quality technical judgment in ambiguous environments: You’re comfortable making pragmatic engineering decisions with incomplete information — especially when dealing with external systems, distributed workflows, and real\\-world variability.
* Hands\\-on builder who ships: You enjoy writing code, reviewing code, debugging production issues, and shipping meaningful improvements — not just designing systems on paper.
* Comfort working within shared platforms or frameworks: You can work effectively within framework constraints, apply abstractions correctly, and contribute improvements based on real usage rather than theoretical ideals.
* Strong debugging and systems thinking: You can reason across system boundaries — external APIs, long\\-running workflows, metadata pipelines, and partner code — to diagnose and fix complex issues.
* Clear technical communicator: You can collaborate effectively with internal teams and external ecosystem builders, provide actionable feedback in code reviews and design discussions, and translate messy real\\-world feedback into engineering outcomes.


**Why Is Atlan for You?**
 At Atlan, we believe the future belongs to the humans of data. From curing diseases to advancing space exploration, data teams are powering humanity's greatest achievements. Yet, working with data can be chaotic—our mission is to transform that experience. We're reimagining how data teams collaborate by building the home they deserve, enabling them to create winning data cultures and drive meaningful progress.
   

  

**Joining Atlan Means**
* Ownership from Day One: Whether you're an intern or a full\\-time teammate, you’ll own impactful projects, chart your growth, and collaborate with some of the best minds in the industry.
* Limitless Opportunities: At Atlan, your growth has no boundaries. If you’re ready to take initiative, the sky’s the limit.
* A Global Data Community: We’re deeply embedded in the modern data stack, contributing to open\\-source projects, sponsoring meet\\-ups, and empowering team members to grow through conferences and learning opportunities.


 As a fast\\-growing, fully remote company trusted by global leaders like Cisco, Nasdaq, and HubSpot, we’re creating a category\\-defining platform for data and AI governance. Backed by top investors, we’ve achieved 7X revenue growth in two years and are building a talented team spanning 15\\+ countries.
   

  

 If you’re ready to do your life’s best work and help shape the future of data collaboration, join Atlan and become part of a mission to empower the humans of data to achieve more, together.
   

  

**We are an equal opportunity employer**
