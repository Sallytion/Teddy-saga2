We’re their technology operating system – giving them everything they need to run their businesses, market their products and services, and expand to new markets. Our product portfolio contains software for business insights, communication and relation management tools and intelligent automations.
 




  






 We’re incubated at NSRCEL, IIM Bangalore, and recognized by Startup India. Our founders are BITS Pilani and SPA engineer\\-architect duo with 15 years of combined experience with startups and top MNCs. The company is based in Bangalore, but the team is distributed across India.

 Product Design begins as a hypothetical concept. Transforming that Concept into a functional Product is a highly creative and experimental process with nuanced understanding (expertise) of fundamentals \\& principles. For every HW product physical form factor defines its utility, limitations, and indeed market. The form factor of the HW product is influenced by the different components that goes inside it. So, to engineer and realize a HW product with optimal form factor we may have to go beyond the conventions “thumb rules” in designing and we should be enabled with the strong fundamentals understanding, right tools, components, and access to an able manufacturing ecosystem.
 



  





 Except, geographically we are in a place where our ecosystem (component providers, manufacturers, and market) has limitations in realising designs that challenge the conventions. This requires us to constantly work on identifying and exploring the vendor ecosystem, which helps us improvise and realise our designs for optimal form factor. You will be handling the design, development, manufacturing, and testing of the embedded systems. The Design team will be your internal customers.
 



  





**Your primary contribution will be towards:** 



1. Supporting CynLr’s Product Design team with all Embedded Systems related activities.
2. V\\&V: Coming up with test procedure for verifying firmware and system. Executing the tests and validating the manufactured PCBs.
3. Interface with the vendors (PCB manufacturers, component suppliers, simulation services providers) to coordinate and plan supply chain to successfully complete the project in time.
4. Be the Embedded systems knowledge base and support system for the Design engineers and freshers who join the organization.



  





**Job Requirements** 




 Electronics Fundamentals:
 


* Excellent understanding of Digital \\& Analog Electronics.
* Solid understanding of Registers and Memory (RAM/ROM/Flash) CONFIDENTIAL Job Requirements

* Experience in designing circuits with signal conditioning i.e impedance matching, handling EM interference, handling differential signals, and ADCs.
* Excellent understanding of power circuits, design of AC to DC and DC to DC convertors.
* Excellent knowledge of processor architectures (ARM/x86/GPU/FPGA).



  





**Firmware Design \\& Development:** 



* Must have excellent understanding and strong tendency to develop \\- Modular, Scalable and Maintainable code. We are ‘fixated’ with “Functional” output the code that we develop that, we forget about the “user” of the code – Code may work functionally but



 o how easy is the code to integrate with other code?
 



 o How easy is to test it?
 



 o How easy is to develop further?
 



 o How easy is to update or modify the code?
 



 o How minimal a number of bugs happen or modifications I must do to use this code with other code? Also, the Code often uses another code/library to build – e.g.: VISA, Vision Development Module, Mathscript module, etc.
 



 Unfortunately, contrary to our wish and belief that you have built bug\\-proof perfectly working code, the actual bugs will come out only when someone else uses them!! \\- This is Systems development life cycle \\- Wikipedia
 


* Excellent Firmware development skills using C or C\\+\\+.
* Experience developing firmware for applications where memory is premium. Verification and Validation: Unfortunately, contrary to our wish and belief that you have built bug\\-proof perfectly working code, the actual bugs will come out only when someone else uses them!! \\- This is SW Development lifecycle.
* Strong knowledge of communication protocols. (USART, USB, Ethernet, EtherCAT etc...)
* Good understanding of high speed intra board communication protocols. (PCIe, I2C, SPI, MIPI)
* Excellent understanding of operating systems and work experience in using RTOS.
* Excellent understanding of IDEs, cross compilers and debugging tools.



  





**Verification and Validation** 



* Adept in using hardware debugging tools JTAG and ICSP
* Experience preparing test procedures and developing test fixtures to verify PCB.
* Excellent with code debugging and memory profiling.
* Experience in reading and understanding PI/SI, thermal and structural analysis reports.
