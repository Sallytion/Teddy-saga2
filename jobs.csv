**Job Summary**
 If you're the kind of engineer who can turn an idea into an MVP in days or weeks, not months or years, we want you. If you’re craving innovation, passionate about complex problem\\-solving, and unafraid of work stress, you’re in the right place. We are building cutting\\-edge products on the latest tech stacks — and we’re moving fast. This is your opportunity to make a tangible impact, at scale, where speed and innovation truly matter.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As a Principal Engineer, you will be a technical powerhouse, a strategic thought partner, and a hands\\-on builder. You’ll lead architecture decisions, mentor talented engineers, and deliver world\\-class products that redefine how governments serve their communities.

**What You'll Do**
* Architect and deliver cloud\\-native, scalable, secure SaaS applications.
* Code hands\\-on and push MVPs to production in days or weeks, not months.
* Drive technical excellence — setting high standards for code quality, scalability, and performance.
* Solve hard problems at speed — with creativity, pragmatism, and relentless focus on outcomes.
* Collaborate deeply with product, design, and business teams to drive innovation from ideation to launch.
* Mentor and inspire senior engineers, cultivating a culture of continuous learning and innovation.
* Champion modernization — bringing new tools, frameworks, and ideas to keep us on the leading edge.


**What We're Looking For**
* 10\\+ years of experience designing and building distributed, cloud\\-native systems at scale.
* Fluent in modern programming languages such as Node, Java, Go, Python, or similar.
* Deep hands\\-on experience with AWS (or major cloud providers), Kubernetes, Docker, and modern DevOps practices.
* Proven track record of shipping products quickly and building MVPs that evolve into production\\-grade systems.
* Strong architecture chops, balanced by a bias for action and a roll\\-up\\-your\\-sleeves mentality.
* Excellent communicator and collaborator — you bridge the gap between tech, product, and business.
* Passionate about building systems that are not just high\\-performing but meaningful for society.
* Bonus Points
+ Experience in SaaS, GovTech, or regulated environments.
+ Expertise in security, compliance (FedRAMP, SOC 2\\), or public\\-sector tech.
+ Interest in data platforms, AI/ML applications, or citizen engagement solutions.


**Why OpenGov?**
* Massive Impact: Shape the future of how governments operate and serve.
* Speed Matters: We move fast, we build fast, and we learn fast.
* Own Your Work: Big challenges, big ownership, and the freedom to innovate.
* Culture of Excellence: Smart, driven teammates who challenge and inspire you every day.
* If you're ready to build, ship, and change the world — let's talk.


**Why OpenGov?**
**A Mission That Matters.**
 At OpenGov, public service is personal. We are passionate about our mission to power more effective and accountable government. Government that operates efficiently, adapts to change, and strengthens public trust. Some people say this is boring. We think it’s the core of our democracy.
   

  

**Opportunity to Innovate**
 The next great wave of innovation is unfolding with AI, and it will impact everything—from the way we work to the way governments interact with their residents. Join a trusted team with the passion, technology, and expertise to drive innovation and bring AI to local government. We’ve touched 2,000 communities so far, and we’re just getting started.
   

  

**A Team of Passionate, Driven People**
 This isn’t your typical 9\\-to\\-5 job; we operate in a fast\\-paced, results\\-driven environment where impact matters more than simply clocking in and out. Our global team of 800\\+ employees is united in our commitment to challenge the status quo. OpenGov is headquartered in San Francisco and has offices in Atlanta, Boston, Buenos Aires, Chicago, Dubuque, Plano, and Pune.
   

  

**A Place to Make Your Mark**
 We pride ourselves on our performance\\-based culture, where every employee is encouraged to jump in head\\-first and take action to help us improve. If you have a great idea, we want to hear it. Excellent performance is recognized and rewarded, and we love to promote from within.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/opengov-inc","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQGmHhbJOXCFPQ/company-logo_100_100/B4DZXI0doSHwAQ-/0/1742830951197/opengov_inc_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=np9UHtd3a5FsmCv0FiIWmjCimT49eboPfgFbgacnBz8","","","","","","","","","","",""
