**UKwellness is Looking for:******
**What’s MyARC?**
 The future of fitness is creator\\-centric — and MyARC is building the operating system for it.
   

  

 The online fitness market is projected to reach $60B by 2027, and creators with massive followings are perfectly positioned to lead this wave. But current tools limit them — they can't scale their offerings or serve their fans affordably. We solve that.
   

  

 A creator with 100k\\+ followers can realistically only coach 30 clients using today’s tools, due to the need for manual personalisation. That’s why coaching costs $500–$1,000/month. It’s not scalable. MyARC changes that.
   

  

 We use intelligent automation to personalise training plans at scale, so a single creator can now train unlimited fans. This reduces costs for consumers (from $1,000/month to $20/month) and lets creators build scalable, high\\-margin businesses without hiring support teams.
   

  

 We’ve helped creators go from minimum wage to 6\\-figure incomes and are on track to build MyARC millionaires. Our users include people overcoming obesity, diabetes, and cancer — transforming their health using affordable, personalised fitness.
   

  

 MyARC democratises fitness and economically empowers creators.
   

  

**🎯 Your Role: React Native Developer**
 We’re growing fast with an ambitious product roadmap — and we're looking for a React Native Developer with an entrepreneurial mindset to help shape our mobile experience. You'll work directly with founders and engineers to ship high\\-impact features quickly. This is a unique opportunity to make an outsized impact — building products that touch thousands of lives while helping creators build wealth doing what they love.
   

  

**🛠️ Key Responsibilities**
**🔑 Build Fast, Ship Fast**
 Write production\\-level React Native code that directly impacts users. You’ll ship updates in days, not weeks.
   

  

**🔑 Own The Mobile Experience**
 Collaborate with product and design to deliver best\\-in\\-class mobile experiences — media\\-rich, scalable, and intuitive.
   

  

**🔑 Adapt and Execute**
 Work comfortably in a fast\\-paced, unstructured environment. You'll thrive in ambiguity and be proactive in driving features end\\-to\\-end.
   

  

**🔑 Maintain Quality**
 Write clean, testable, maintainable code and uphold best practices as business needs evolve.
   

  

**✅ Minimum Requirements**
* 5\\+ years of professional experience in mobile or full stack development
* Strong experience with Expo React Native, including common libraries for state management, navigation, and UI
* Solid understanding of React and Next.js
* Proficient in TypeScript and modern JavaScript (ES6\\+)
* Comfortable writing scalable, maintainable code
* Excellent communication in English (written and verbal)
* Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field


**🔍 Must\\-Have Skills**
* Expo React Native (mobile\\-first mindset)
* React \\& Next.js (bonus for web crossover work)
* State management (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Recoil)
* Hermes, animations, deep linking, notifications, etc.
* Clean code principles \\& mobile testing frameworks
* Familiarity with REST APIs and async data flows


**🌟 Bonus / Preferred Skills**
* Python (Django/DRF preferred, or other backend experience)
* Experience working on media\\-heavy apps (video, audio, real\\-time data)
* Remote collaboration with international teams
* Experience building consumer apps or SaaS tools
* Interest in health, wellness, or fitness technology


**💡 Mindset \\& Values**
* Quick learner with strong analytical thinking
* Challenges the status quo constructively
* Driven to leave things better than they were found
* Entrepreneurial spirit — you care about building something meaningful
* Passion for fitness, health, and positive user impact
