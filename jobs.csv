**About Pixxel**
 Pixxel is a space data company and spacecraft manufacturer redefining Earth observation with hyperspectral imaging.
   

  

 The companys first three commercial hyperspectral satellitesFirefliesdeliver imagery at 5\\-meter resolution and 135\\+ spectral bands, providing 50x richer detail than traditional Earth observation systems and unlocking insights across agriculture, climate, energy, environment, and more.
   

  

 Once fully deployed, Pixxels constellation of 18\\-24 satellites will capture imagery across up to 250 bands in VNIR and SWIR ranges, with a 40 km swath and daily global revisit capability.
   

  

 Pixxels most unique strength is its full\\-stack approach, integrating every layer of the value chain from satellite hardware and manufacturing to AI\\-powered analytics.
   

  

 Pixxels satellite constellation is complemented by Aurora, its in\\-house Earth Observation Studio that simplifies satellite imagery analysis and democratises remote sensing for all.
   

  

 Designed to make hyperspectral data more accessible, Aurora by Pixxel combines high\\-frequency imagery with AI\\-powered tools to generate actionable insights, even for users without technical backgrounds.
   

  

 The third pillar of Pixxels ecosystem is its in\\-house satellite manufacturing capability.
   

  

 Beyond building its own spacecraft, Pixxel also provides satellite systems and subsystems to other organisations.
   

  

 This dual capacity sets it apart in a sector where most companies focus on either payload design or data operations, but not both.
   

  

 Pixxels team is young but deeply mission\\-aligned, with a culture rooted in curiosity, speed, and long\\-term thinking.
   

  

 As the company grows its constellation and expands Aurora, the focus remains on making space\\-based insights practical, scalable, and genuinely helpful so that the health of the planet becomes measurable and action becomes possible.
   

  

 Pixxel was the only Indian startup selected for the Techstars Starburst Space Accelerator in Los Angeles and has been recognised in TIMEs Best Inventions of 2023, Fast Companys Most Innovative Companies, and Via Satellites Top Innovators list.
