 As a Software Development Engineer 2 you are in a mid\\-level
   

 Individual Contributor role at Tesco. Engineers at SDE2 level will continue
   

 their career development and show potential for an SDE3 role. SDE2 is a
   

 stepping stone towards SDE3, rather than a career destination in its own right.
   

 At this level, your impact reaches across a team, and you provide technical
   

 leadership of medium to large features. You are starting to produce your own
   

 work by understanding the problems that the team faces and are beginning to
   

 support other engineers with their own delivery and development. You prioritise
   

 sharing your skills and knowledge. You also prioritise quality of work, helping
   

 your team to continually set the standard. You understand and apply best
   

 practice within Tesco and across the industry.

 My impact reaches across the team in which I work. I
   

 provide technical leadership of medium to large features, participating in
   

 their design and taking accountability for their delivery. I am comfortable
   

 implementing and shipping end\\-to\\-end stories and am starting to understand the
   

 deeper problems in my part of the business. I am likely to be considered an
   

 expert in a specific part of my domain. This is the first level at which I do
   

 more than complete the work that’s been assigned to me: I am starting to build
   

 and prioritise my own work by understanding the problems my team faces and
   

 proposing, implementing, and delivering solutions to them. I am aware of the
   

 short\\-term and long\\-term goals across my product. I work within my team,
   

 utilising data driven decision making techniques, to encouraging optimal
   

 outcomes whilst accepting appropriate trade\\-offs. I am comfortable both
   

 supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on major
   

 components or small services as appropriate. At this level I display a degree
   

 of ownership for the work conducted by the team and am experienced enough to
   

 know when I need support. I am able to identify risks and raise these as
   

 appropriate. At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those
   

 around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their
   

 onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to
   

 speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone
   

 that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise
   

 sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team. I contribute to the
   

 raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce
   

 and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively
   

 provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code. I
   

 have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco
   

 architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into
   

 practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment
   

 strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing
   

 these within my team. I am comfortable working in a group context and am
   

 capable of communicating technical concepts to key stakeholders. 
 








  

  


**You will need**

 experience in backend services development using Java, Springboot and related
   

 backend technologies, frameworks.

 As a Software Development Engineer 2 you are in a mid\\-level
   

 Individual Contributor role at Tesco. Engineers at SDE2 level will continue
   

 their career development and show potential for an SDE3 role. SDE2 is a
   

 stepping stone towards SDE3, rather than a career destination in its own right.
   

 At this level, your impact reaches across a team, and you provide technical
   

 leadership of medium to large features. You are starting to produce your own
   

 work by understanding the problems that the team faces and are beginning to
   

 support other engineers with their own delivery and development. You prioritise
   

 sharing your skills and knowledge. You also prioritise quality of work, helping
   

 your team to continually set the standard. You understand and apply best
   

 practice within Tesco and across the industry.

 implementing and shipping end\\-to\\-end stories and am starting to understand the
   

 deeper problems in my part of the business. I am likely to be considered an
   

 expert in a specific part of my domain. This is the first level at which I do
   

 more than complete the work that’s been assigned to me: I am starting to build
   

 and prioritise my own work by understanding the problems my team faces and
   

 proposing, implementing, and delivering solutions to them. I am aware of the
   

 short\\-term and long\\-term goals across my product. I work within my team,
   

 utilising data driven decision making techniques, to encouraging optimal
   

 outcomes whilst accepting appropriate trade\\-offs. I am comfortable both
   

 supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on major
   

 components or small services as appropriate. At this level I display a degree
   

 of ownership for the work conducted by the team and am experienced enough to
   

 know when I need support. I am able to identify risks and raise these as
   

 appropriate. At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those
   

 around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their
   

 onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to
   

 speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone
   

 that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise
   

 sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team. I contribute to the
   

 raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce
   

 and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively
   

 provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code. I
   

 have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco
   

 architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into
   

 practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment
   

 strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing
   

 these within my team. I am comfortable working in a group context and am
   

 capable of communicating technical concepts to key stakeholders.

**Preferred qualifications:**

**About The Job**
 Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is an engineering discipline that combines software and systems engineering to build and run large\\-scale, massively distributed, fault\\-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that Google's services—both our internally critical and our externally\\-visible systems—have reliability and uptime appropriate to users' needs and a fast rate of improvement while keeping an ever\\-watchful eye on capacity and performance.
   

  

 SRE is also a mindset and a set of engineering approaches to running better production systems—we build our own creative engineering solutions to operations problems. Much of our software development focuses on optimizing existing systems, building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation. As SREs are responsible for the big picture of how our systems relate to each other, we use a breadth of tools and approaches to solve a broad spectrum of problems. Practices such as limiting time spent on operational work, blameless postmortems and proactive identification of potential outages factor into iterative improvement that is key to both product quality and interesting and dynamic day\\-to\\-day work.
   

  

 SRE's culture of diversity, intellectual curiosity, problem solving and openness is key to its success. Our organization brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame\\-free environment.

 As a Principal Software Development Engineer, you are key in shaping large parts of Tesco’s technical landscape. You contribute to strategic planning, combining business vision and industry best practices to define technical strategy and make decisions. You typically work across multiple teams, setting standards for engineering excellence and efficient technical design. You are hands\\-on and guide teams to improve technology across product portfolios, infrastructure, and processes. As a senior technical expert, you are a thought leader for large and complex areas. You set technical direction to translate strategy into action, making a significant impact to the organisation. You own the design, implementation, and delivery of software that shapes products and technologies. You use your depth of skill and experience to enable multiple teams around you to deliver excellent software quickly. 
   

**You will be responsible for**
 My impact is across the directorate that I am a member of, but also reaches beyond to effect change across the wider organisation. I solve problems and deliver solutions that impact the whole engineering organisation. I would generally expect to be given a very high\\-level problem to work on, but everything after that is me: identifying and formalising the problem, converting it into a simple technical solution, leading its implementation, and training the rest of the organisation to use it.
   

 As a senior technical authority, I deliver value that materially changes outcomes for the company, and my job is not just about my technical judgement but also my ability to influence others to deliver results. I am an authority on multiple technologies and in multiple domains; senior engineers from other teams come to me for advice on the architecture of their products. I am a proponent of an effective engineering community that encourages learning for all.
   

 I guide large complex programmes of work, working with and influencing the engineering, product, programme, and business teams. In doing so I influence build vs buy decisions, deprecate legacy software, and lead significant refactoring. I make the right trade\\-offs to influence the roadmap and sequencing of work to deliver early and often. I am hands on with design and coding to resolve hard problems that have a long\\-term impact.
   

 I guide one or more areas and define the strategic design keeping security, scalability, extensibility, and reusability in mind. I drive Tesco’s Inner Source Platform, maintaining and contributing to projects whilst influencing direction and adoption. I have strong communication and influencing skills to resolve disputes and to lead stakeholders to appropriate decisions with data points and foresight. I have sufficient breadth and depth of technical knowledge to influence senior leaders on engineering strategy. I build strategy documents, designs and code which are exemplary and serve as a model for others. I write
   

 critical path code, having a good appreciation of the whole stack. I innovate and stay ahead of industry trends, competition, and new paradigms and share appropriately. I routinely come up with PoCs to evaluate approaches or technology choices to enable or accelerate programmes.

 My impact reaches beyond my immediate team, and I provide perspective and context for technology choices across my directorate. The work that I do has foundational
   

 impact across teams in my area and the directorate that I am a member of. I am a technical leader for my teams and others will regularly come to me for mentorship and
   

 support. I am comfortable both supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on key features as appropriate. I have delivered multiple projects that move
   

 the needle for the business. I have demonstrated technical breadth and depth; I am an expert in my domain.
   

 At this level I display a high degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team. I am accountable for the quality of every result, produced by individuals and teams. I
   

 am an advocate of best practices across my directorate. I build maturity in the way we develop, deliver and operate services. I ensure that we’re learning from the best in the
   

 industry, designing and implementing appropriate testing and deployment strategies.
   

 I can anticipate feature evolution of my product. I utilise this when facilitating design sessions to ensure that the system architecture evolves to support future requirements. I
   

 understand the wider Tesco architectural strategy and champion its application to the systems that I work on. At this level my job starts to become just as much about
   

 exercising technical judgment as it does about implementation.
   

 I am comfortable managing competing priorities and am able to bring order to ambiguous scenarios. I create optimal outcomes combining short\\-term and long\\-term goals,
   

 utilising data driven decision making techniques to take appropriate trade\\-offs. I can identify risks and proactively engage with product and programme managers. I am a
   

 strong communicator within my team and to my stakeholders.
   

 I am a trusted mentor, a role\\-model for more junior engineers. I am approachable and am frequently asked to mentor those around me. I prioritise sharing skills and
   

 technical knowledge across the directorate, both informally in 1:1 discussions and by arranging more formal training opportunities
