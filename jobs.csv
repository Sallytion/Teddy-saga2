At this level I display a degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team and am experienced enough to know when I need support. I am able to identify risks and raise these as appropriate. At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team. I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code. I have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing these within my team. I am comfortable working in a group context and am capable of communicating technical concepts to key stakeholders.

At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team. I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code. I have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing these within my team.
