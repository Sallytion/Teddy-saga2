 Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means ‘more than you’d expect’, and it’s been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it’s only fitting that we’d pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.
   

  

 We think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn’t be siloed from the rest of the organisation – they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.
   

  

 Speaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is ‘champion the customer’, which means we address real pain points that businesses face. Next up is ‘succeed as a team’, which highlights how our strength lies in our diversity and trust in each other. We also ‘make it happen’ by taking bold decisions and following through to deliver results. Last but not least, we ‘build to scale’, creating lasting solutions that address today’s challenges and anticipate tomorrow’s needs.
   

  

 So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 850\\+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal and Lisbon offices —and quite a few full\\-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by things like a good work\\-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us, we'll help you set up the best remote setup possible

* Apply core data science methods — modeling, A/B testing, scoring, clustering, and time\\-series forecasting — to enhance agent intelligence and broader product features
* Partner with backend, infra, and product teams to build reusable, scalable GenAI infrastructure: model serving, prompt versioning, logging, evals, and feedback loops
* Continuously evaluate and monitor agent performance, hallucination rates, and real\\-world effectiveness using rigorous experimentation frameworks
* Influence HighLevel's AI roadmap while mentoring engineers and contributing to technical standards and best practices


**Requirements:**
* 5\\+ years of experience in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Applied AI, with a track record of delivering production\\-grade models and systems
* Hands\\-on expertise with LLMs: fine\\-tuning, prompt engineering, function\\-calling agents, embeddings, and evaluation techniques
* Strong experience in building retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG) systems using vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate)
* Experience working in cloud\\-native environments (GCP, AWS) and deploying models with frameworks like PyTorch, Transformers (HF), and MLOps tools
