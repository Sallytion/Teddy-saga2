**About the Role:**
 As a founding member of our Bangalore engineering hub, you will lead the backend development for Remitly's new business\\-payment products.

* Technically Fearless: You are comfortable jumping into unfamiliar codebases, understanding how they work, and making the changes needed to move your project forward.
* A Strong Collaborator: You know how to explain your technical needs to other teams and can negotiate solutions that work for everyone involved.
* Proficient in Golang \\& AWS: You have deep experience with Go and cloud infrastructure, particularly in building secure and scalable microservices.
* Action\\-Oriented: You thrive in ""0\\-1"" situations where you have to find your own answers and push through technical ambiguity to deliver results.
* Detail\\-Oriented: You care about the ""boring"" but essential parts of engineering—security, data consistency, and clear documentation.


**Our Benefits:**
* Medical, Dental \\& Vision Insurance
* Life Insurance
* Mental Health \\& Family Forming benefits

**Our Connected Work Culture: Driving Innovation, Together**
 At Remitly, we believe that true innovation sparks when we come together. Our Connected Work Culture fosters dynamic in\\-person collaboration, where ideas ignite and challenging problems find solutions faster.
