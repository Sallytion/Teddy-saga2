 At DevRev, we’re building the future of work with
 **Computer** 
 – your AI teammate.
   

  

 Computer is not just another tool. It’s built on the belief that the future of work should be about genuine human connection and collaboration – not piling on more apps.
   

  

 Computer is the best kind of teammate: it amplifies your strengths, takes repetition and frustration out of your day, and gives you more time and energy to do your best work.
   

  

 How?
   

  

 Easy: it’s the only platform capable of…
   

  

**Complete data unification**
 Most AI products focus on either structured data (like CRM records and support tickets), or unstructured data (like documents and emails). Computer AirSync connects everything, unifying all your data sources (like Google Workspace, Jira, Notion) into one AI\\-ready source of truth: Computer Memory.
   

  

**Powerful search, reasoning, and action**
 Once connected to all your tools and apps, Computer is embedded in your full business context. It can find and summarize, sure. Even more impressive: it offers employees insights, strategic and proactive suggestions, plus powerful agentic actions.
   

  

**Extensions for your teams and customers**
 Computer doesn’t make you choose between new software and old. Its AI\\-native platform lets you extend existing tools with sophisticated apps and agents. So your teams – and your customers – can take action, seamlessly. These agents work alongside you: updating workflows, coordinating across teams, and syncing back to your systems.
   

  

 This isn’t just software. Computer brings
 *people* 
 back together, breaking down silos and ushering in the future of teamwork, through human\\-AI collaboration. Stop managing software. Stop wasting time. Start solving bigger problems, building better products, and making your customers happier.
   

  

 We call this Team Intelligence. It’s why DevRev exists.
   

  

 Trusted by global companies across multiple industries, DevRev is backed by Khosla Ventures and Mayfield, with $150M\\+ raised. We are 650\\+ people, across eight global offices.
   

  

**About The Role**
 DevRev's ADaaS (Airdrop\\-as\\-a\\-Service) Snap\\-in is a key component in enabling extensibility, integrations, and custom behavior in our platform. As a member of the Connector team, you will build, maintain, and enhance ""connectors"" – pieces of code that integrate external systems, data sources, or interaction flows into DevRev. You will work closely with backend, frontend, and infrastructure teams to ensure connectors are robust, secure, performant, and meet both product and customer needs.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* Design, build, and maintain connectors/snap\\-ins to external systems or services (APIs, data pipelines, etc.).
* Collaborate with product managers to deeply understand use\\-cases \\& requirements; translate those into clean, maintainable technical designs.
* Write high\\-quality code in JavaScript / TypeScript (Node.js, front\\-end or where relevant) following best practices.
* Implement and optimize data structures \\& algorithms in connector logic to ensure performance and scalability.
* Work on system design matters for connectors: error handling, retries, batching, rate limits, etc.
* Ensure security and data integrity when interacting with external services.
* Write and maintain tests, documentation, and metrics / monitoring for the connectors.
* Participate in code reviews; help teammates maintain code quality and correctness.


**What You'll Bring**
* Experience: 2\\-5 years of software development experience.
* Technical skills: Strong in JavaScript and/or TypeScript. Comfortable writing backend code (Node.js or equivalent).
* Strong understanding of CS fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, complexity (time/space), etc.
* Experience in system design — being able to design systems at scale (connector frameworks, integration layers, retry \\& failure models, etc.).
* Experience working with external APIs, webhooks, authentication/authorization (e.g. OAuth, API keys), error\\-handling.
* Knowledge of asynchronous programming and concurrency in JS/TS.
* Good debugging and performance\\-profiling skills.

 At DevRev, we’re building the future of work with
 **Computer** 
 – your AI teammate.
   

  

 Computer is not just another tool. It’s built on the belief that the future of work should be about genuine human connection and collaboration – not piling on more apps.
   

  

 Computer is the best kind of teammate: it amplifies your strengths, takes repetition and frustration out of your day, and gives you more time and energy to do your best work.
   

  

 How?
   

  

 Easy: it’s the only platform capable of…
   

  

**Complete data unification**
 Most AI products focus on either structured data (like CRM records and support tickets), or unstructured data (like documents and emails). Computer AirSync connects everything, unifying all your data sources (like Google Workspace, Jira, Notion) into one AI\\-ready source of truth: Computer Memory.
   

  

**Powerful search, reasoning, and action**
 Once connected to all your tools and apps, Computer is embedded in your full business context. It can find and summarize, sure. Even more impressive: it offers employees insights, strategic and proactive suggestions, plus powerful agentic actions.
   

  

**Extensions for your teams and customers**
 Computer doesn’t make you choose between new software and old. Its AI\\-native platform lets you extend existing tools with sophisticated apps and agents. So your teams – and your customers – can take action, seamlessly. These agents work alongside you: updating workflows, coordinating across teams, and syncing back to your systems.
   

  

 This isn’t just software. Computer brings
 *people* 
 back together, breaking down silos and ushering in the future of teamwork, through human\\-AI collaboration. Stop managing software. Stop wasting time. Start solving bigger problems, building better products, and making your customers happier.
   

  

 We call this Team Intelligence. It’s why DevRev exists.
   

  

 Trusted by global companies across multiple industries, DevRev is backed by Khosla Ventures and Mayfield, with $150M\\+ raised. We are 650\\+ people, across eight global offices.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Own and resolve complex production bugs in backend (Golang) and frontend (ReactJS) services. Lead root cause analysis (RCAs), contribute to postmortems, and take part in service health reviews.
* Collaborate with service owners and support teams to deliver small features and config\\-based enhancements.
* Influence system design reviews and advocate for debuggability and observability.
* Participate in code reviews and enforce engineering best practices.
* Mentor and coach mid\\-level engineers and interns, supporting their onboarding, technical growth, and adoption of debugging/debug\\-readiness practices.
* Post Month 6: Actively resolve production incidents and participate in retrospectives.
* Contribute to authoring and maintaining L3 engineering playbooks focused on systematic debugging using logs and observability tools.
* Drive AI\\-assisted productivity adoption across the team (e.g., Cursor, Claude).


**Qualifications**
* 1–7 years of software engineering experience.
* Strong in either Golang or ReactJS and working proficiency in the other.
* Mandatory:
+ Hands\\-on coding experience with active contribution to production systems.
+ Prior experience in Sustenance Engineering, L4 engineering, Customer Engineering, or equivalent support\\-focused engineering teams.

* Strong debugging, logging, and observability mindset for distributed systems.
* Experience writing postmortems, service health assessments, and reliability reports.
* Familiar with tools like Grafana, Datadog, Kibana, or similar.
* Demonstrated mentorship experience – coaching engineers, leading pairing sessions, and creating knowledge\\-sharing material.


**Bonus** 
 : Exposure to multi\\-tenant SaaS systems and modern AI\\-enhanced dev tooling.
   

  

 As part of our hiring process, shortlisted candidates will undergo a Background Verification (BGV). By applying, you consent to sharing personal information required for this process. Any offer made will be subject to successful completion of the BGV.
