**Role: SDE\\-3**
**Location: Bangalore**
**About ANAROCK And MyHQ**
 At myHQ, we’re reimagining how India works. We are building India’s largest marketplace platform for flexible workspaces helping individuals and teams across 20\\+ cities find workspaces that just work.
   

  

 We’re a small, product\\-first team backed by ANAROCK, moving fast and solving real engineering problems at scale. This is where you’ll get to own systems end\\-to\\-end, not just push tickets.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We’re looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer (SDE\\-3\\) who can combine hands\\-on engineering with technical leadership. Someone who enjoys building, scaling, and securing frontend systems from the ground up while guiding a small team to do the same.
   

  

 This role goes beyond feature delivery — you’ll manage infra, shape engineering practices, and set the direction for how we scale our products. Perfect for someone who’s a builder at heart, excited by tough problems, and comfortable working in an early\\-stage startup environment.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Own frontend architecture end\\-to\\-end: design, build, and scale systems that power critical user\\-facing flows.
* Go deep into performance and infra: optimize bundles, Core Web Vitals, caching, and monitoring at scale.
* Define engineering practices: CI/CD pipelines, testing frameworks, observability, and security standards for frontend.
* Operate like an owner: manage infra pieces (cloud\\-native setups, deployments, monitoring tools) where frontend needs to tie into platform reliability.
* Collaborate closely with backend and product to solve cross\\-cutting problems (latency, API contracts, data flows).
* Mentor and lead engineers in the team, raising the engineering bar through design/code reviews and technical strategy.
* Balance short\\-term delivery with long\\-term scalability, helping the team ship fast without compromising architecture.


**Desired Skills/ Experience**
* 5–8 years building production\\-grade frontend applications at scale.
* Expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, and at least one modern framework (React/Angular).
* Strong grasp of frontend architecture patterns, state management, and performance tuning.
* Experience working with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and cloud\\-native environments
* Prior experience in early\\-stage teams or building products from scratch.


**Nice to have**
* Experience with SEO and PWA
* Built products from scratch or previous experience at working at a start\\-up
* Ability to mentor engineers and drive technical decision\\-making.
* A history of working on side/hobby projects and contributing to open source projects


**People \\& Culture**
* Freedom to execute, an open culture with passionate and smart co\\-workers
* Performance oriented team driven by ownership and open to experimentation
* Lean, fast\\-moving team where engineers own critical systems end\\-to\\-end.


**Other Perks / Benefits**
* Comprehensive term and health insurance for you and your dependents
* Paid maternity / paternity leave to let you spend valuable time with your loved ones


**Frequently Asked Questions**
**What’s the interview process like?**
 The interview process consists of 3\\-4 rounds of technical discussion of 60 mins each and a 30 min cultural fitment discussion. The technical discussion rounds cover past projects, programming basics, DS / Algo and system design. This is followed by a 30 min cultural fitment round.
   

  

**What’s the technical stack that you’re working on?**
 Our tech stack is built on NodeJS, Angular, React, Redis and MongoDB.
