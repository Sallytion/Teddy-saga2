* TimeBack: An educational platform driving Alpha School's 2\\-hour learning framework (99th percentile test outcomes).
* Incept: A content generation platform producing all customized educational materials for multiple learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
* Crossover: An AI\\-driven hiring platform managing tens of thousands of applicants monthly, staffing schools and organizations worldwide.


 You'll take ownership of one platform and dedicate the majority of your time to constructing the most complex components of the codebase with a small team (3\\-5 experienced engineers, no junior members). The architecture choices you make will dictate whether other teams can ship new applications quickly, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Correct decisions unlock exponential leverage. Poor choices generate integration chaos and destroy momentum across multiple teams.
   

  

 You design what you build and operate. You define quality standards and establish patterns for your platform. We operate on a spec\\-driven approach: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. You'll have significant autonomy, no committees, no approval boards. This is a small, high\\-performing team where you're directly accountable for what you deliver.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Drive strategic architectural choices and define technical patterns your team will adopt.
* AI Leadership: Champion new AI workflows and develop high\\-impact playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the complex, mission\\-critical portions of the codebase with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality benchmarks.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Serving as an architect who doesn't write code
* Spending excessive time in meetings
* Managing personnel (this role focuses on technical leadership, not people management)
* Maintaining legacy systems or working on internal IT infrastructure


**Basic Requirements**
**Lead Software Architect key responsibilities**
* A minimum of 5 years of professional software development experience delivering software products
* A minimum of 3 years in a lead engineer capacity (conducting code reviews) or architect role (driving key technical decisions)
* Experience building platform\\-level products where your APIs were consumed by other teams
* Active, deep involvement with AI tools, consistently experimenting and exploring new frontiers


**About LearnWith.AI**
 LearnWith.AI is an edtech startup that leverages AI and subject matter experts to cultivate a new way of learning. Our unique approach leverages 50\\+ years of learning science, cutting\\-edge data analytics and AI\\-powered coaching. In doing so, we can help students learn more, learn faster, and learn better \\- and have fun while doing it. We are a remote\\-first company that hires globally via Crossover.
   

  

 There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!
   

  

**Working with us**
 This is a full\\-time (40 hours per week), long\\-term position. The position is immediately available and requires entering into an independent contractor agreement with Crossover as a Contractor of Record. The compensation level for this role is $100 USD/hour, which equates to $200,000 USD/year assuming 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. The payment period is weekly.
