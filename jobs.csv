But unlike software (with observability platforms such as AppDynamics and Datadog), construction teams lack automated feedback loops to help projects stay on schedule and on budget. Without this observability, construction wastes a whopping $3T per year because glitches aren’t detected fast enough to recover.
   

  

 Doxel AI exists to bring computer vision to construction, so the industry can deliver what society needs to thrive. From hospitals to data centers, from foreman to VPs of construction, teams use Doxel to make better decisions everyday.

We’re building out new workflows, analytics dashboards, and forecasting engines. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
   

  

 We're at an exciting stage of scale as we build upon our growing market momentum. Our software is trusted by Shell Oil, Genentech, HCA healthcare, Kaiser, Turner, Layton and several others. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
   

  

**The Role**

If you're passionate about shift\\-left testing, automation, and embedding rigorous validation at every stage, this role is for you.

Your expertise in CI/CD integration, performance testing, and security validation will enable seamless execution of AI\\-driven analytics, 360\\-degree video processing, and massive dataset handling. Your work will empower construction teams with precise, real\\-time decision\\-making tools.
   

  

**Who You Are**
 You are obsessed with preventing issues before they arise, ensuring robust automation and infrastructure. You excel in complex systems, balancing client\\-side computation, real\\-time data, and backend integrations.
