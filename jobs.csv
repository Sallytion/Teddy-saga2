+ Collaborate with QA, DevOps, and product teams to validate deployment readiness.

* Shift\\-Left Release Practices:
+ Embed release readiness into earlier phases of the SDLC.
+ Define and enforce processes for deployment request submission, traceability, and accountability.

* Process \\& Automation:
+ Drive automation for release management (workflows, approvals, evidence generation).
+ Maintain CI/CD pipeline health and ensure consistency across client environments.

* Collaboration \\& Communication:
+ Act as the primary release contact for product, engineering, and client stakeholders.
+ Clearly communicate deployment status, risks, and post\\-deployment validation results.







**Required Skills \\& Experience** 
* 8\\+ years of experience in Release Management, DevOps, or related roles, preferably in a SaaS environment.
* Strong understanding of CI/CD pipelines (GitLab, Jenkins, or equivalent).
* Experience with release management workflows (e.g., JIRA, ServiceNow).
* Knowledge of shift\\-left testing and release practices.
* Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, OCI) and microservices architecture.
* Strong problem\\-solving skills with the ability to manage incidents under pressure.
* Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills.


**Preferred Qualifications** 
* Hands\\-on experience with feature flag rollouts, canary deployments, and automated release evidence generation.
* Familiarity with DORA metrics and release performance measurement.
* Prior experience supporting regulated environments with compliance\\-driven release practices.







**Nice to Have** 
* Exposure to SaaS multi\\-tenant architecture and release practices.
* Knowledge of observability/monitoring tools (Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK).
* Familiarity with DORA metrics and their application in SaaS release cycles.
* ITIL certification or Release \\& Deployment Management certification.
