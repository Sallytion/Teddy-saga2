 Position at LeadVenture India
   

  

**Senior Infrastructure Engineer \\-** 
*Build Our Foundation*
**Location:** 
 Gurgaon, India (Hybrid)
   

  

 Are you an engineer who loves building the rock\\-solid foundation that everything else runs on? Do you enjoy the challenge of weaving different technologies—Windows, Linux, on\\-prem, and cloud—into a single, powerful platform?
   

  

 If you want to architect and own the core infrastructure of a global company, this role is for you.
   

  

**Who is LeadVenture?**
 You’ve probably never heard of us, and that’s okay. We’re the secret tech engine behind tens of thousands of local dealerships globally. When a dealer competes online and against the largest businesses, they’re using our software. We provide the SaaS solutions that help them thrive.
   

  

 Our solutions are our promise to our customers. Your mission is to make sure it's unbreakable.
   

  

**Your Mission:** 
**Engineer Our Global Platform**
 Our company is growing incredibly fast and is a leader in multiple areas. Your mission is to help design, build, and manage the core infrastructure that powers it all.
   

  

 This isn’t just about keeping the lights on. It’s about creating a scalable, secure, and efficient foundation for future growth.
   

  

* You will help architect and deploy the infrastructure for our new projects, ensuring they meet the highest standards for performance and uptime.
* You will master a hybrid world, expertly managing both Microsoft (Active Directory, IIS, SQL, Clustering) and Linux environments (Ubuntu, Apache, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch).
* You will own our resilience, implementing and managing complex backup, storage (SAN/NAS), and disaster recovery solutions.
* You will bridge the gap to the cloud, using your experience with public cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.
* You will be the expert, acting as an escalation point for critical issues and mentoring junior engineers.


**This Role is for You if:**
* You have a history of engineering success in a fast\\-paced SaaS or enterprise environment.
* You have a solid\\-to\\-excellent understanding of networking, including firewalls and load\\-balancers.

* You understand the importance of security and have worked with compliance principles like SOC2 or PCI\\-DSS.
* You are a master of documentation, time management, and prioritization.
* You have a flexible approach, understanding that mission\\-critical systems sometimes need attention outside of standard business hours.

 You have options. At a bigger company, you might manage one small part of the infrastructure. Here, you get to work on all of it. You'll have the autonomy to design new systems and the satisfaction of seeing your work directly impact the company's success.
   

  

**Ready to Build Our Foundation?**
 Apply now. Let's have a conversation.
