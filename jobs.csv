 AION is building an interoperable AI cloud platform by transforming the future of high\\-performance computing (HPC) through its decentralized AI cloud. Purpose\\-built for bare\\-metal performance, AION democratizes access to compute and provides managed services, aiming to be an end\\-to\\-end AI lifecycle platform—taking organizations from data to deployed models using its forward\\-deployed engineering approach.
   

  

 AI is transforming every business around the world, and the demand for compute is surging like never before. AION thrives to be the gateway for dynamic compute workloads by building integration bridges with diverse data centers around the world and re\\-inventing the compute stack via its state\\-of\\-the\\-art serverless technology. We stand at the crossroads where enterprises are finding it hard to balance AI adoption with security. At AION, we take enterprise security and compliance very seriously and are re\\-thinking every piece of infrastructure from hardware and network packets to API interfaces.
   

  

 Led by high\\-pedigree founders with previous exits, AION is well\\-funded by major VCs with strategic global partnerships. Headquartered in the US with global presence, the company is building its initial core team in India.
