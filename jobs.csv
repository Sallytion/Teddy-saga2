* Are energized by high expectations


 It’s not for everyone, and that’s intentional. If your ambition is matched by your work ethic—and you're hungry for a place where growth, impact, and ownership are the norm—YipitData might be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.
   

  

**Why You Should Apply NOW:**
* Work on high impact, mission critical technical initiatives for the company, such as accelerating Kubernetes adoption, or making AI accessible to every employee
* Have the opportunity to always be learning new technologies and not become static in your skillset


**About The Role:**
 We're looking for a
 **Infrastructural Backend Engineer** 
 excited to join the Infrastructure \\& Tools team. Our AWS cloud infrastructure and developer tools allow engineers to
 *quickly develop \\& release solutions that are secure, reliable, scalable, and cost\\-efficient* 
 . Our responsibilities include:
   

  

* Providing standard architectures that are reliable, scalable, and secure
* Providing robust infrastructure abstractions through our internal PaaS
* Providing guidance on application development, deployment, reliability, scalability, and security


 This team has been building cloud platforms and developer tools for almost a decade and is one of the reasons our engineering group has been so lean as our company scales. We own common infrastructure and abstractions so teams can manage their resources independently and build apps efficiently. Because of our work, engineers are able to independently:
   

  

* Manage applications through our custom PaaS
* Build and deploy custom infrastructure using our library of CDK constructs
* Manage CI/CD pipelines using our guidelines and templates
* Use web development best practices through our Python libraries


 Day\\-to\\-day work on this team is interdisciplinary and can range from implementing new features to the platform, performing Infra updates with limited downtime, and supporting engineering team initiatives with new and noble solutions. The Infrastructure team is a mission critical team that enables multiple engineering teams to be efficient and productive.
   

  

*Standard IST working hours are permitted with the exception of 2 \\- 3 days per week, when you will join meetings with the US and LatAm team. On these days, work hours will be between 2:30 \\- 10:30pm IST. (Please note that we allow for flexibility on the following days to make up for the previous day’s late work schedule!)*
**As Our Infrastructure Backend Engineer You Will:**
* Report to the Infrastructure lead and work closely with the Infra and Tools lead, who will provide significant, hands\\-on training on our tools and processes
* Become an AWS subject matter expert (CloudFormation, ECS, EC2, RDS, S3, SQS, VPC, IAM, etc.)
* Experiment with new technologies and incorporate them into our systems (R\\&D)
* Contribute to our cloud infrastructure platform and developer tools
* Create tools and processes to increase the efficiency of engineering teams
* Collaborate with engineering teams to enhance the Infrastructure Platform


**You Are Likely To Succeed If you have:**
* 3\\+ years of coding in Python as your primary language
* 2\\+ years of experience with Django
* 2\\+ years of hands\\-on experience with AWS, including CloudFormation, EC2, ECS, EKS, RDS, S3, SQS, VPC, IAM, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, etc. You’ve done things beyond manually using the AWS console. You're comfortable using the AWS CLI and boto3\\. You wouldn’t be surprised if I asked you when to use Fargate vs EC2 for the AWS ECS service
* 2\\+ years of experience with Kubernetes, preferably as someone who managed the Infrastructure and deployments


**You are comfortable working with new cloud technologies and learning new skills**
* You understand that AI is not a fad, and can improve your workflow, from coding to automating tasks
* Nice to have: Experience with Terraform, CDK/CDKTF, Databricks, Datadog, Airflow, ElastiSearch, React


**What We Offer:**
**Our compensation package includes comprehensive benefits, perks, and a competitive salary:**
* We care about your personal life, and we mean it. We offer flexible work hours, flexible vacation, a generous 401K match, parental leave, team events, wellness budget, learning reimbursement, and more!
* Your growth at YipitData is determined by the impact that you are making, not by tenure, unnecessary facetime, or office politics. Everyone at YipitData is empowered to learn, self\\-improve, and master their skills in an environment focused on ownership, respect, and trust. See more on our high\\-impact, high\\-opportunity work environment above!


*We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, gender, gender identity or expression, or veteran status. We are proud to be an equal\\-opportunity employer.*
