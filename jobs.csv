 Suki is creating a new category in the health tech space – the digital assistant. We are going to be the voice user interface for healthcare. What does that mean? Currently, doctors use their electronic medical record system to track patient encounters (a digital version of the old paper charts you used to see in your doctor's office and on TV). These systems can be hard to navigate and very time consuming to manage – time that doctors would rather have to spend with their patients. This is the problem we're solving right now! Doctors that use Suki already spend over 50% less time on administrative tasks and we're striving to do even better.
   

  

 We are creating engaging product experiences, building applications and services that delight and empower doctors with experiences that they could never imagine with their health IT systems. We're a team of technologists, clinicians, and industry experts working together to push the limits on technology used in medicine and even how medicine is practiced. We’re a GCP shop and 100% container run using Kubernetes. Our tech stack includes Golang, Python, React, React Native, Swift, Android, Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript.
   

  

**What will you do everyday?**
 We are looking for a
 **Software Developer**

* Collaborating with the product, design and operations teams to build a world class product
* Developing, owning and maintaining highly scalable distributed services and solutions
* Implementing a microservices based architecture using Golang and Python
* Ensure application performance, uptime, and maintaining high standards of code quality
* Maintaining continuous integration and deployment tools; creating unit and integration tests for written software code


**Ok, you're sold, but what are we looking for in the perfect candidate?**
* Expertise: You know how to code. You understand our tech stack and can be productive with it. In other words, you’ve done this before.
* Action oriented: You love to build. You like to ship fast and quickly iterate.
* Creativity: You enjoy listening to user feedback and then building product in novel ways. You’re resourceful and enjoy finding alternate paths to success.
* Problem solving: you use data to help point you in the correct direction. You optimize relentlessly. You think business and engineering problems are like puzzles and you stick with them until they are solved.
* Humility: You’re humble and love working in a team without ego to deliver products
* Adaptability: You thrive in a fast\\-moving organization that uses light\\-weight process and cutting\\-edge technology to have a huge impact.
* Confidence: You trust your abilities and you’re ready to push yourself to the next level.


**Qualifications\\***
* Strong product development experience in building distributed systems and microservices.
* 5 to 8 years experience
* Strong programming skills on Linux using Go
* Strong foundation in data structures, algorithms and a strong understanding of concurrent programming
* Superior organization, written/verbal communication, interpersonal and leadership skills
* Ability to collaborate effectively with cross functional teams to solve complex problems and building products spanning across geographically distributed teams to deliver end\\-to\\-end products \\& features
* Ability to multi\\-task and re\\-prioritize responsibilities based on changing requirements
* Bachelors/Masters degree from a Tier 1 college or university


 It will be a huge plus if you have:
   

  

* Experience working with gRPC, gRPC context and Protocol Buffers
* Experience with infrastructure and systems engineering, and scaling services on cloud computing platforms like GCP


**Working at Suki:**
 Our hybrid model offers the perfect balance of in\\-office collaboration and remote flexibility which includes three days in the office (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) and two days work from home (Thursday and Friday).The role is located in Bangalore and will require working from office three days a week.
   

  

**Tell Me More About Suki**
* On a roll: Named by Fast Company as the Next Big Thing in Tech, by Comparably for the Best Leadership Team, by Frost \\& Sullivan for a Technology Innovation Leadership award, just to name a few.
* Great team: Founded, managed, and backed by successful tech veterans from Google and Apple and medical leaders from UCSF and Stanford. We have technologists and doctors working side\\-by\\-side to solve complex problems.
* Great investors: We’re backed by Venrock, First Round Capital, Flare Capital, March Capital, Hedosophia and others. With our $165M raised so far, we have the resources to scale.
* Huge market: Disrupting a massive, growing $30\\+ billion market for transcription, dictation, and order\\-entry solutions. Our vision is to become the voice user interface for healthcare, relieving the administrative burden on doctors instead of adding to it.
* Great customers: Our solutions are used in health systems and clinics across the country, supporting clinicians across dozens of specialties. Check out what one of our users says about how Suki has helped given her a sense of balance.
