 We are looking for Senior Software Engineers who can work directly with founders, operate with high autonomy, and build products from scratch. This role sets a far higher bar than typical engineering positions. You are expected to work with:
 



  





**1\\. Extreme Ownership** 
  This is not a typical “take a ticket and implement it” role. You will:
 



  




* Build entire products end\\-to\\-end, not just individual features.

* Ship usable versions fast.
* Remove blockers proactively.
* Be comfortable working in rapid build–test–iterate cycles.



  





**3\\. Excellent Code Quality** 
 Most of the products we build go on to scale. You must:
 



  




* Write clean, modular, OOP\\-driven code following SOLID principles.
* Never ship features without automated tests.
* Maintain ERDs, schemas, and documentation rigorously.
* Treat code reviews as a craft, not a chore.

 You are the last line of defence before anything ships. You are expected to:
 



  




* Personally use and test new features before release.
* Ensure nothing goes live without passing functional and qualitative checks.



  





**5\\. AI\\-Powered Engineering (Non\\-Negotiable)** 
  We operate with an AI\\-first engineering model. This means:
 



  




* You must know how to use tools like Claude Agents, GitHub Copilot/Codex, and other AI systems to accelerate development.
* This is 
 *not* 
  copy\\-paste ChatGPT coding.
* You are expected to coach AI tools, review their output, ensure clean maintainable code, and verify all changes before merging.



  





 Simply said, without AI\\-assisted development, you cannot meet the velocity expectations of this role.
