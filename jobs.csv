 Logikality is building
 **AI\\-powered mortgage decision intelligence,** 
*guideline\\-defensible decisions* 
 with full audit trails for regulators and investors.
 



  





 Lenders today lose money on every loan. Back\\-office costs have exploded from roughly $7,600 to over $11,000–$12,600 per loan, and 70–90% of the work is still manual despite decades of “automation.”
 



  





 We’ve built a platform that:
 


* Processes
 **180–250 pages/minute** 
 at \\~
 **98% accuracy**
* Automates underwriting decisions and conditions with
 **70–75% acceptance**
* Validates loans against
 **200\\+ Fannie/Freddie/investor rules** 
 with full explainability and auditability
* Delivers
 **$1,500–2,000 savings per loan** 
 ,
 **4–6\\.5 hours** 
 manual effort saved, and
 **payback in under 30 days** 
 (625–1000% ROI)



  





 Under the hood, we have a
 **15,000\\+ document golden test set** 
 and an
 **evidence\\-first architecture** 
 where every decision is backed by traceable data, rules, and timestamps that regulators can trust.
 



  





**What you’ll work on** 




  





 As an
 **AI/ML Intern** 
 , you’ll work directly with the founding team (IIT \\+ Fortune 500 AI \\+ mortgage veterans) on problems like:
 



  




* Turning a messy loan file into a
 **self\\-organizing workspace** 
 : documents auto\\-classified, data extracted, and linked back to evidence.
* Building and evaluating models that
 **compute borrower income** 
 across W\\-2s, paystubs, rental income, SSI, etc., then explain the math in auditor\\-ready language.
* Designing copilot\\-style workflows that
 **generate underwriting conditions** 
 , track resolution, and minimize rework.
* Working on
 **LLM \\+ retrieval \\+ rules** 
 pipelines that must be
 *explainable* 
 and
 *safe* 
 in a regulated environment.
* Using our
 **15k\\+ document golden dataset** 
 plus underwriter feedback to create lender\\-specific playbooks and continuous learning loops.



  





 You’ll see
 **real production data and constraints** 
 (under NDA), not toy Kaggle problems.
 



  





**What you’ll learn** 




  




* How to build
 **decision\\-ready AI** 
 , not just models that output numbers.
* How to design for
 **auditability and provenance** 
 as first\\-class citizens.
* How to ship ML in a
 **highly regulated, high\\-stakes** 
 domain.
* How to work with a small, senior team where your work is
 **immediately visible** 
 .



  





**Who we’re looking for** 




  





 We care more about
 **traits** 
 than buzzwords. Our ideal interns score high on:
 **coachability, curiosity, prior success, intelligence, and work ethic** 
 .
 



  





**Must\\-haves** 



* Strong programming skills in
 **Python** 
 (NumPy / Pandas / basic PyTorch or TensorFlow).
* Solid ML fundamentals: supervised learning, evaluation metrics, overfitting/regularization, basic NLP.
* Evidence of
 **prior success** 
 in something hard: projects, research, competitions, open\\-source, startups, Olympiads, etc.
* High
 **curiosity** 
 – you self\\-teach; you’ve gone down rabbit holes on your own.
* Ability to commit
 **20\\+ hours/week** 
 for
 **6 months** 
 .
* Comfortable with a
 **high\\-intensity, unpaid internship** 
 where the main “compensation” is learning, network, and a serious shot at a core role.



  





**Nice\\-to\\-haves** 



* Experience with
 **NLP / LLMs / RAG** 
 , or productionizing ML systems.
* Interest/experience in
 **fintech, lending, credit risk, or mortgages** 
 .
* Experience designing
 **data/label pipelines** 
 and evaluation harnesses.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/logikality","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQH2DbjLKH0vPg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1727185035946/logikality_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=XcLzk463tTNiyOySTRWXat7Fw5EHUxlbX8wheT7AZ_8","","","","","","","","","","",""
