**Industry:** 
 Software Development
   

  

**Job Description**
 Hey there!
   

  

 We are looking for a curious developer to join our
 **Backend** 
 team at Procedure. We are a product development company established in early 2017\\. Before we dive into the job description, allow us to introduce ourselves.
   

  

 Our team is a mixed bag. Of the smart and the hard workers. Of the organised and slightly chaotic. Of the early risers and the burners of the midnight oil. We appreciate diversity and truly like having differing perspectives in the room.
   

  

 We pride ourselves on being early adopters of the latest tools, libraries and frameworks while consistently delivering business value. People who work with us fall in love with their craft. We have changed the definition of ""work"" for them.
   

  

**Here Are Some Of Our Beliefs About Work**
* Work is only 1 part of your life and not your entire life. We treat it as such.
* Weekends are sacred and not to be messed around with. So you won't be asked to work on one.
* Commuting is a waste of time. Working from home saves you additional time. Go crazy with it.
* Side gigs are welcome. We believe there are multiple avenues to learn and grow. So why restrict it only to work?
* Asynchronous by\\-default. Synchronous communication is expensive, so we default to writing docs and literature to enable async communication.
* Good things come in pairs. Errors get halved. Productivity, ideas and fun get doubled. Learning gets accelerated exponentially.
* Learning from mistakes. If you are not making mistakes and learning from them, you are not growing.


 Apart from work, we continually invest in growing you as a professional and a human.
   

  

* Extensive Boot Camp \\- get to learn, regardless of your experience, about Data Structure and Algorithms, LLD, HLD, DevOps, frontend, backend and/or test engineering.
* Book club \\- broaden your horizons by picking up a book every month and have fun doing so
* P1, The Half Yearly Tech Conference \\- here's where we explore futuristic themes to keep you informed about what's happening in the tech space outside our office.
* Internal Projects \\- where your craft, experiment and learning precedence over deadlines. Also, try out new technologies and domains.


**Growth requires mentorship**
 We believe choosing a mentor is more important than choosing a company. My co\\-founder, Braj, and I have more than a decade of experience in our respective fields. I will be mentoring you to become a better engineer and a coder. Braj will help you with domain expertise, product thinking and problem\\-solving. Ask us how it has helped our ex\\-employees in their careers when you chat with us.
   

  

**What's It Like Here**
 We love debating over languages and frameworks and want someone who can bring their opinions to these discussions. We love reading/sharing articles, podcasts, and tech essays. If you are someone who loves tea or coffee, Marvel or DC, Peterson or Zizek, or even something eclectic, you will feel right at home. Continuous improvement is at the heart of everything we do at work \\& outside.
   

  

**This sounds good. But what exactly will you work on?**
 Since we are a service company, you will have the advantage of working on a wide gamut of problems, technology \\& real world\\-wise. You will be involved in all stages of a product lifecycle. You'll never have to wonder why you are working on something because you'll always know it.
   

  

**What are you currently working on?**
 We carefully select our clients. This is to ensure we are always indexed well on challenging work. They include indie entrepreneurs, Series B/C funded startups and big corporates.
   

  

 Some of the sectors we are working on
   

  

* Healthtech
* Edtech
* Insurtech
* Sportstech
* Fintech
* And much more!


 Trust us, there's never a dull day at work.
   

  

**Here’s What We Expect From You**
* You love coding and think of it as a craft. We wouldn’t have it otherwise.
* You have a solid grasp of the basics of Python or JavaScript/TypeScript.
* You’ve built and maintained REST APIs using frameworks like Django/Django Rest Framework (Python) or Express/Fastify (Node.js).
* You understand persistence and can work your way around Django ORM or any SQL/NoSQL store confidently.
* You can set up and own your stack on a cloud provider of your choice.
* You have a good understanding of SOLID principles — enough to know when they help and when they don’t.
* You aren’t complacent about your skillset and have a hunger to learn more.
* You like to share your learnings with others.

 We’re looking for a tech generalist who enjoys solving messy, real\\-world engineering problems and wants to work across backend logic, systems, and product workflows.
 



  





 This is
 **not** 
 a narrowly defined role with perfect specs. It’s a role for someone who likes figuring things out.
 



  





**What this role actually is** 




  





 You’ll work on problems where:
 


* requirements evolve as you understand the system better
* backend logic and data flow matter more than UI polish
* edge cases and failure modes are part of the job
* clarity is created through thinking, not handed down in tickets



  





 You’ll collaborate closely with existing engineers and the founder to:
 


* understand how systems behave in production
* simplify and extend backend workflows
* reason through tradeoffs and edge cases
* build new capabilities incrementally and safely



  





 Over time, you’ll naturally take on more responsibility as you understand the system better.
 



  





**What you might work on** 




  





 Examples (not an exhaustive task list):
 


* Backend workflows and APIs with non\\-trivial business logic
* Integrations with external services (communications, payments, etc.)
* Data models and state transitions that must stay correct under edge cases
* Improving reliability, clarity, and maintainability of existing systems
* Using AI tools to accelerate exploration, debugging, and development



  





**Who is a good fit** 




  





 This role is likely a good fit if you:
 



  




* Enjoy thinking through
 **how systems behave** 
 , not just writing code
* Are comfortable working with incomplete or evolving requirements
* Have built and owned systems end\\-to\\-end (even at small scale)
* Don’t mind reading and improving existing code
* Prefer responsibility and problem\\-solving over rigid instructions
* Are curious, fast\\-learning, and comfortable using AI as a productivity tool


- 


 Early\\-career engineers (1–4 years) with strong fundamentals are very welcome.
 



 Laravel experience is not required — ability to learn quickly is.
 



  





**This role is not a good fit if** 




  





 We want to be explicit here:
 



  




* You prefer clearly defined tickets and specs
* You come primarily from a services/consulting background
* You avoid legacy code or refactoring
* You’re mainly interested in frontend/UI work, PM roles, or AI demos
* You’re looking for a narrow, well\\-scoped specialist position



  





**Why this role exists** 




  





 As the product grows, backend systems and decision\\-making matter more than raw execution speed. We’re looking for someone who wants to grow into deeper ownership over time, not just ship isolated features.
 



  





 You’ll have direct exposure to real product decisions and the chance to meaningfully shape how systems evolve.
 



  





**Experience \\& background** 




  





 We care more about how you think than specific titles or stacks.
 



  





 That said, strong candidates typically have:
 


* 1–5 years of hands\\-on engineering experience
* Solid backend fundamentals (any language/framework)
* Evidence of end\\-to\\-end ownership in past projects
* Comfort reading unfamiliar codebases
* The ability to learn new systems quickly



**One last note** 




  





 If you enjoy ambiguity, responsibility, and solving real engineering problems — this role will feel energizing.
 



  





 If you’re looking for structure, tickets, and predictability — it probably won’t.","Internet Marketplace Platforms","https://www.linkedin.com/company/bigtoe-pose-inc.","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFXlh7NuMbfFg/company-logo_100_100/B4EZsN6q7xHEAQ-/0/1765465043064/bigtoe_pose_inc_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=aq9x7GATxVFT3RSRZ2kSztDSQJqGmc7-2YON4dV0IaY","","","","","","","","","","",""
