 You are a seasoned technologist with a product mindset — equally comfortable designing a distributed ledger service or simplifying a compliance\\-driven API for partner integration. You understand that technical excellence is not just about code — it’s about systems that scale safely, teams that deliver predictably, and decisions that align with long\\-term product goals.
   

  

 You will be a
 **technical north star** 
 for multiple product and platform teams — defining architecture, aligning technical strategies with business outcomes, and mentoring technical leads and senior engineers to raise the engineering bar.
   

  

**You Will Contribute To**
**Domain and Architectural Leadership**
* Deeply understand core financial domains (card issuance, payments orchestration, remittance, ledger systems) and translate this knowledge into resilient bounded contexts, canonical data models, and API standards.
* Define and own the long\\-term backend architecture roadmap, ensuring coherence across microservices and shared infrastructure.
* Champion clean architecture and Domain\\-Driven Design (DDD) principles, owning complex cross\\-domain decisions (e.g., transaction reconciliation, settlement workflows).
* Serve as the architectural authority in design reviews, incident postmortems, and roadmap discussions.


**Engineering Excellence and Quality**
* Lead the engineering excellence charter, establishing organization\\-wide guidelines for code quality, testing, CI/CD, and security hygiene.
* Define and continuously track key engineering KPIs (e.g., Service SLAs, MTTR, Deployment Frequency) to quantify and improve outcomes.
* Mentor technical leads and senior engineers, raising the overall engineering bar and enabling Generative AI\\-assisted engineering workflows responsibly.


**Hands\\-on Technical Contribution**
* Architect, prototype, and profile Go\\-based distributed services for high\\-throughput, low\\-latency financial flows.
* Apply expert knowledge of Go's concurrency, synchronization, and runtime tuning to design performant and scalable services.
* Lead postmortems, fault\\-injection sessions, and conduct deep\\-dive performance tuning using tools like $pprof$.


**Stakeholder Collaboration and Influence**
* Partner closely with Product, Compliance, Risk, and Business teams, translating functional requirements into resilient technical designs.
* Represent engineering trade\\-offs in executive forums and lead major cross\\-functional initiatives (e.g., multi\\-region rollout, PCI\\-DSS compliance).
* Maintain technical debt registers and remediation plans, acting as the technical conscience to balance delivery pace with operational integrity, security, and auditability.


**Required Experience And Qualifications**
* 8–12 years of backend engineering experience, with at least 5 years in Go in high\\-scale, distributed systems.
* Proven experience architecting and scaling financial systems (payments orchestration, card processing, or ledgering).
* Expert understanding of Go concurrency, synchronization, and runtime tuning.
* Strong grounding in relational data design (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and event\\-driven patterns.
* Practical knowledge of security, encryption, and compliance standards (PCI\\-DSS, MAS, ISO 27001\\) in a regulated fintech environment.
* Experienced in observability and SRE practices (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Grafana) and capacity planning.
* Demonstrated ability to mentor senior engineers and influence technical direction at scale, including articulating complex issues to all organizational levels.
* Familiarity with IaC, Kubernetes, service mesh, and API gateways.
* Experience with AI\\-assisted engineering tools (e.g., Copilot, CodeWhisperer) is a plus.


**MatchMove Culture:**
