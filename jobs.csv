You don't simply write software—you architect AI\\-powered systems that make conventional engineering appear slow and wasteful. If this resonates with you, continue reading.
   

  

 Most engineering teams still operate the traditional way—manual debugging sessions, experimental deployment strategies, and features that use AI superficially beyond basic Copilot autocomplete. Trilogy operates differently. AI permeates every stage of our development workflow: concept generation, bug identification, defect remediation, and performance tuning. This isn't about experimenting with AI utilities; this is about deeply embedding AI throughout the software lifecycle to remove inefficiency, accelerate delivery, and engineer with accuracy.
   

  

 In this position, you will take established B2B products, deconstruct them, reconstruct them as cloud\\-native solutions, and enhance them with AI at every layer. You'll be building and shipping AI\\-enhanced features, applying advanced retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG) for automated defect identification, and guaranteeing every deployment is seamless—zero downtime, zero interruptions, zero compromises. If you're seeking a position where you invest weeks deliberating architectural choices instead of delivering, this isn't the right fit.
   

  

 If you're prepared to expand the limits of AI\\-integrated software engineering and advance your career trajectory, apply now. If you prefer remaining in your comfort zone, manually writing test suites, or collaborating in teams that resist automation, this opportunity isn't for you.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Utilizing analysis tools and RAG vector stores to detect, diagnose, and resolve product defects and address bugs.
* Applying AI development agents to architect, build, and ship innovative features for cloud\\-native applications.
* Guiding AI agents and serving as the quality checkpoint for AI\\-generated outputs; AI outputs are not flawless and demand your engineering judgment.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Routine Monotony: We minimize cumbersome infrastructure overhead so you can concentrate on building innovative solutions.
* Endless Meetings: We prioritize your development expertise over conference room time. Expect more building, less discussing.


**Software Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Deploy AI\\-powered features to optimize workflows and equip service providers with innovative capabilities.


**Basic Requirements**
* A minimum of 4 years of professional experience in commercial software development, with emphasis on production code for server\\-side web applications
* A minimum of 1 year of experience with serverless architectures and cloud\\-native development (any cloud vendor)
* Experience leveraging GenAI code assistants (e.g., Github Copilot, Cursor, v0\\.dev); we are not seeking traditional ML engineers without LLM experience
* Experience writing production\\-level code in at least two general\\-purpose coding languages, such as Typescript, Javascript, Python, or C\\#
* Experience building APIs
* Experience working with SQL databases
