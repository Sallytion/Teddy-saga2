We’re growing fast and building a team of passionate, curious people across the globe. Learn more about what makes us special by checking out our values.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are building the next foundational layer of the analytics stack: an
 **Enterprise Context Platform** 
 that captures, stores, and exposes organizational decision memory.
   

  

 As a seasoned engineer on Context Platform Systems, you will architect and build the
 **durable memory substrate** 
 that powers agentic analytics workflows. This platform stores not just metadata, but
 *meaning* 
 : decisions, intent, rationale, and history — and makes it safely accessible to humans, agents, and applications.
   

  

 This is a greenfield, high\\-leverage role with company\\-level impact.
   

  

 What You’ll Do
   

  

* Prototype apt technical solutions and find best fits for the context engine. Architect and build the core Context Platform
* Design schemas and primitives for Decision Memory and enterprise context
* Own context storage systems (graph, vector, event/time\\-based)
* Build read/write/query APIs used by agents, products, and external apps
* Design permission\\-aware, auditable context access
* Ensure the context engine is interoperable, portable, and zero\\-lock\\-in by design
* Partner closely with agentic systems engineers and product leadership


 What You’ll Own
   

  

* Context schemas and schema evolution strategies
* Storage and data modeling choices
* Platform APIs and interfaces
* Security, identity propagation, and audit foundations
* Long\\-term scalability and correctness of context data


 What You Won’t Own
   

  

* Agent behavior or orchestration logic
* Business rules or governance policy decisions
* Product UI or workflow automation


 (Those are consumers of the platform you build.)
   

  

 What We’re Looking For
   

  

* Significant experience building distributed systems, data platforms, or infrastructure
* Comfort operating in ambiguous, greenfield problem spaces
* Deep expertise in data modeling and schema design
* Experience designing shared platforms used by many teams
* Strong instincts around APIs, contracts, and backward compatibility
* Ability to reason about systems, not just components


 Nice to Have
   

  

* Experience with knowledge graphs, metadata systems, or search/retrieval systems
* Experience building systems with governance, auditability, or compliance requirements
* Familiarity with dbt or modern analytics stacks or developer tooling


 Why This Role Matters
   

  

 If this platform is built correctly:
   

  

* Agents become trustworthy
* Governance scales without slowing teams down
* We become the System of Decision for analytics


 This role lays the foundation for the next S\\-curve of the company.
   

  

 dbt Labs is an equal opportunity employer, committed to building an inclusive team that welcomes diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. Even if your experience doesn’t perfectly align with the job description, we encourage you to apply—we value potential just as much as a perfect resume.
