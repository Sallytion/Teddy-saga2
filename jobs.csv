**About the Role:**
 We're seeking Software Development Engineer III with a deep mastery of Flutter and a forward\\-thinking approach to AI\\-assisted development. If you’ve architected complex systems, shipped high\\-performance mobile apps at scale, and pushed the boundaries of what AI can do for software engineers — this role is for you.
   

  

 You’ll join the team behind our Mobile Platform: a flexible, modular system powering a growing ecosystem of customisable business apps. You’ll be responsible for building features from the ground up, guiding architectural decisions, and pioneering how AI can reliably write code, minimize hallucinations, and enhance every step of our dev lifecycle.
   

  

**Responsibilities:**
* Architect and own high\\-performance, scalable mobile software — from initial design to long\\-term stability and performance.
* Build production\\-grade Flutter apps used by thousands of customers daily, across diverse industries and use cases.
* Leverage LLMs and AI tools to write, refactor, test, and debug code efficiently — while implementing guardrails to reduce hallucination and boost reliability.
* Develop and maintain shared tooling, frameworks, and libraries that empower other engineers to build fast with confidence.
* Collaborate with designers, PMs, and platform/backend engineers to ship full\\-stack features.
* Measure and improve app performance, test coverage, code health, and build stability using modern dev tooling.
* Stay on the bleeding edge of AI/LLM technology, Flutter best practices, and mobile architecture patterns — and bring that knowledge back to the team.


**Requirements:**
* 5–8 years of professional engineering experience (SDE II/III), including 3\\+ years in Flutter/Dart.
* Demonstrated ability to architect maintainable, modular mobile systems.
* Mastery of Flutter internals, widget lifecycle, performance profling, and effective state management approaches.
* Track record of shipping and supporting large\\-scale mobile apps in production.
* Fluency in RESTful API design, mobile CI/CD, and Git\\-based workflows.
* Strong understanding of AI\\-driven development tools — including prompt engineering, LLM\\-based code generation, test writing, and code review automation.
* Familiarity with hallucination mitigation strategies (e.g., code constraints, test scaffolding, embeddings, context injection).
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills — especially in distributed, asynchronous teams.
* Bonus: Contributions to AI tooling, Flutter open\\-source libraries, or AI\\-enhanced mobile features.
