 Amazon moves millions of packages every day through the world's largest transportation network of planes, trucks, and delivery vehicles. Before any package can be assigned to a route, someone needs to design that network \\- figure out which lanes exist, how much capacity each node and lane can handle, and what changes are needed as demand shifts. That's what we build.
   

  

 Global Transportation Tech Services (GTTS) creates software that manages the foundation of Amazon's outbound transportation network. Your work has direct financial impact on network efficiency and directly affects whether customers get their packages on time.
   

  

 Here's what we actually do: We build the platform that transportation teams use to design and change the network \\- from evaluating new lanes to putting them live. We calculate how much capacity each node and lane will have, so the network can handle the volume. We identify where capacity will fall short and alert operators before it becomes a problem. We spot packages at risk of missing delivery and give operators tools to protect them. When a hurricane hits Florida or a snowstorm shuts down highways in the Midwest, our systems detect the disruption, protect customers by adjusting delivery promises, and help move volume to keep packages flowing.
   

  

 The challenges are real: modeling capacity across a massive global network, managing thousands of network changes safely, predicting capacity gaps weeks in advance, detecting and responding to disruptions in real\\-time, and keeping systems running 24/7\\.
   

  

 We regularly build new greenfield products while also modernizing existing systems. You'll have space to explore new technologies and approaches to solve customer problems. We work with AWS services, big data processing (Spark/Scala), optimization algorithms, machine learning models, and GenAI.
   

  

 As a leader on the team, you will be expected to operate at all levels, diving deep into the details while providing strategic inputs for the product. You will be a key player in driving strategic planning, project execution, hiring and development of engineering talent, driving operational excellence, and shaping up the solutions to achieve our vision.

 We’re looking for an intern to help us
 **build and implement AI\\-powered internal tools** 
 for our
 **team** 
 . This role is focused on
 **using AI to solve real internal problems** 
 \\- pulling information from multiple places, handling messy inputs, writing scripts, and building systems that our teams can actually use. Most of the work will involve
 **coding/scripting and building AI\\-backed tools from scratch** 
 , with some portion involving workflow tools like n8n or Zapier. The work is exploratory by nature. You’ll be experimenting, building, testing, and improving AI systems that help GTM teams work faster and more efficiently.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Build internal AI tools that can be hosted and used by GTM teams.
* Write scripts and systems that use existing AI models to solve real problems.
* Work with data coming from multiple sources and formats.
* Handle edge cases, ambiguity, and inconsistent inputs.
* Use AI models to analyze information and generate useful outputs for internal use.
* Use automation tools (like n8n / Zapier) where it makes sense.
* Improve and iterate on tools based on internal feedback.


 Collaborate with engineering and GTM stakeholders to understand problems and ship solutions.
   

  

**Must\\-Have Skills**
 These are
 **non\\-negotiable** 
 :
   

  

* Python: Comfortable writing scripts and small programs.
* Past AI project experience is mandatory. Academic projects, internships, hackathons, or strong personal projects are all valid. You should be able to clearly explain what you built, how AI was used, and why it mattered.
* AI / Machine Learning fundamentals: Understanding of how AI / ML models work conceptually. Experience using existing AI or ML models (cloud or open\\-source).
* Ability to build solutions using existing models.
* Comfort working with unstructured or semi\\-structured data.
* Willingness to learn quickly and work in an experimental environment.


**Nice\\-to\\-Have Skills**
 These are
 **good bonuses** 
 , not requirements:
   

  

* Experience with automation tools like n8n or Zapier.
* Experience combining data from multiple sources into a single workflow.
* Familiarity with scripting beyond Python.


**Who This Role Is For**
 Experience with REST APIs, Basic knowledge of web hooks \\& backend concepts.
   

  

* Someone interested in AI implementation, not just theory.
* Comfortable with rapid experimentation and ambiguity.
* Curious about how GTM teams operate and how AI can improve internal workflows.
* Open to learning during the first few weeks and then owning real projects.


**Who This Role Is NOT For**
* Someone looking only for academic ML research.
* Someone without prior AI project experience.
* Someone expecting a fully defined, non\\-experimental problem set.
* Someone unwilling to build and iterate independently.


**Internship Timeline**
 Weeks 1–2: Onboarding \\& Context
   

  

* Understand how the company and GTM teams operate
* Get familiar with existing internal AI tools
* Review past projects and current workflows
* Set up your development environment


 Month 1: Working on Existing Systems
   

  

* Contribute to maintaining and improving existing AI tools
* Identify areas for improvement based on real usage
* Ship enhancements end to end


 Months 2\\-4: Owning some Internal AI Products/Projects
   

  

* Scope and design an AI solution for a real internal problem
* Build and deploy it end to end
* Work with internal stakeholders to iterate


 Months 5–6: Scaling \\& Advanced Work
   

  

* Improve reliability and handle edge cases
* Work on more complex integrations or other projects


**What Success Looks Like**
 By the end of the internship, success means:
   

  

* You’ve built and shipped multiple internal AI tools for GTM teams.
* At least one tool is actively used by internal stakeholders.
* You can independently take a vague problem, design an AI\\-based solution, and implement it.
* Your work reduces manual effort or improves speed for GTM teams.
* You’ve demonstrated strong ownership, learning ability, and execution.


**What Happens After the Internship?**
 This is a fixed 6\\-month internship and does not automatically convert into a full\\-time role.
   

  

 However, for interns who perform well and demonstrate strong execution and ownership:
   

  

* Our engineering team will be interested in interviewing you for full\\-time roles when relevant positions open up.


 There is no guaranteed conversion, but strong performance will be noticed and considered seriously.
   

  

 Regardless of what happens next, you will leave with:
   

  

* Hands\\-on experience building and shipping AI systems used by actual users
* Practical exposure to designing and implementing applied AI workflows
* Real project ownership in a production environment


 Applied AI experience is in high demand across the industry, and the work you do here will strengthen your profile for similar roles across the market.","Education","https://www.linkedin.com/company/almabase","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHEegqsTE31xA/company-logo_100_100/B56ZwOUsLuHUAQ-/0/1769766831259/almabase_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=k63117Yoa287IYDKRfJUQXizum0qN2SUc9KKzfyjwbA","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Molecule AI is building AI\\-driven infrastructure for drug discovery. Our platform, MoleculeGEN, combines generative models, physics\\-based simulation, and domain knowledge to accelerate the design of novel therapeutic molecules. We were recently recognized as ""Emerging AI\\-Powered Drug Discovery Platform"" (BioSpectrum Asia Excellence Awards 2024\\).
 



 We're a multidisciplinary team where AI researchers work alongside expert chemists, biologists, and physicists to solve genuinely hard problems at the intersection of computation and life sciences.
 



  





**The Role** 




  





 We're seeking a senior AI technical leader to design and build the computational infrastructure that enables efficient drug discovery at scale.
 



 This is a hands\\-on technical position where you'll architect AI systems, make critical design decisions, and lead implementation by our AI engineering team.
 



 You'll build reusable frameworks and infrastructure that enable efficient computational experimentation across multiple therapeutic programs—the platform layer, not the application layer.
 



 You'll work directly with our chemistry, biology, and physics experts—learning enough domain knowledge to translate scientific requirements into system architectures, while bringing deep AI expertise they don't have.
 



  





**What We're Building** 




  





**AI infrastructure for intelligent computational experimentation.** 




  





**The core challenge:** 
 Drug discovery involves searching astronomical chemical spaces (10^60\\+ possible molecules) to find rare candidates worth testing in the lab. This requires frameworks that can:
 


* Orchestrate computational experiments efficiently
 
 : You have multiple computational methods available—from fast neural network predictions (milliseconds) to rigorous quantum simulations (hours). Each has different costs, speeds, and accuracy guarantees. Build systems that intelligently route billions of candidates through these methods, deciding which experiments to run on which molecules and when.
* Handle uncertainty and validation
 
 : Design decision frameworks that know when to trust fast predictions versus when to escalate to expensive rigorous validation. Build calibration systems ensuring cheap surrogate models align with ground truth.
* Navigate multi\\-objective optimization
 
 : Drug candidates must simultaneously satisfy competing objectives—potency, safety, synthesizability, manufacturing cost. Build frameworks that explore trade\\-offs and help navigate decisions where there's no single ""right"" answer.
* Learn from feedback
 
 : Create systems that improve as experimental results come back from the lab. Design feedback loops where wet\\-lab validation refines computational models, making future searches more efficient.



  





**The technical reality** 
 : Off\\-the\\-shelf ML frameworks don't handle these constraints. You'll need to design novel approaches, identify what can be adapted from existing research, and figure out what requires genuine innovation.
 



  





**The interdisciplinary aspect** 
 : You'll collaborate closely with domain experts who understand what makes molecules druggable but may not know what modern AI can do. This means learning enough chemistry/biology to have intelligent technical conversations while teaching domain experts what's computationally feasible and what isn't.
 



  





**What You'll Do** 




  





**System Architecture \\& Design** 



* Design infrastructure for multi\\-stage computational workflows
* Make technical decisions about which AI approaches to apply where and why
* Architect systems handling heterogeneous computational methods with different guarantees

* Guide AI engineering team through architecture reviews and technical discussions
* Evaluate and integrate relevant research (generative models, optimization methods, multi\\-agent systems)
* Design computational experiments to validate approaches and measure progress
* Analyze results and iterate on system design based on empirical findings
* Own technical outcomes from concept to validated results



  





**Cross\\-Functional Collaboration** 
*(with chemistry/biology/physics experts and AI researchers/engineers)* 



* Understand scientific constraints and domain requirements from chemistry/biology/physics experts
* Translate between domain language and technical specifications in both directions
* Guide AI team in implementing solutions that respect scientific constraints
* Communicate capabilities and limitations clearly across disciplines
* Build shared understanding through iterative problem\\-solving



  





**What You Bring** 




  






 Required
 




**AI/ML Expertise** 



* Deep understanding of capabilities and trade\\-offs of modern AI architectures, frameworks, and tools
* Strong grasp of fundamentals: probabilistic modeling, uncertainty quantification, multi\\-objective optimization
* Experience designing and building complex AI systems (not just training individual models)
* Ability to find, understand, and apply or adapt relevant research appropriately for task at hand



  





**Systems Thinking \\& Technical Depth** 



* Experience architecting systems with heterogeneous components
* Understanding of computational cost/latency/accuracy tradeoffs
* Comfortable engaging with code: can review implementations, understand technical decisions, debug issues collaboratively with engineers
* Strong foundations in experiment design, evaluation methodology, and statistical analysis
* Track record shipping complex systems to production or research validation



  





**Collaboration \\& Learning** 



* Ability to learn new technical domains quickly
* Clear communication: can explain complex systems to varied audiences
* Intellectual humility: comfortable saying ""I don't know"" and asking good questions



  





**Education \\& Experience** 



* PhD in Computer Science, AI/ML, or related field (or equivalent demonstrated expertise through shipped systems and technical contributions)
* 8\\+ years building AI/ML systems with increasing technical responsibility
* 3\\+ years in technical leadership roles (architecture decisions, guiding teams, owning outcomes)



  





**Plus** 



* Experience with AI for scientific applications (computational biology, materials science, chemistry, physics)
* Background in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, or drug discovery
* Publications in top\\-tier venues (AI conferences: NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR; domain venues)
* Experience with multi\\-agent systems, reasoning frameworks, or large\\-scale optimization
* Familiarity with physics\\-based simulation methods



  





**What Success Looks Like** 




  





**In the first year:** 



* Infrastructure enabling multiple therapeutic programs to run efficiently
* Validated improvements in computational efficiency (candidates evaluated per GPU\\-hour, quality of lab\\-tested molecules)
* Strong collaborative relationships with chemistry/biology teams
* Clear technical roadmap for platform evolution



  





**Long\\-term:** 



* Platform that demonstrably accelerates drug discovery timelines
* Novel technical contributions (systems, methods, architectures) that advance the field
* Team of AI engineers you've mentored and grown
* Recognition as technical leader in AI for drug discovery



  





**What We Offer** 



* Work on genuinely novel technical problems at the intersection of AI and life sciences
* Collaborate with world\\-class experts across AI, chemistry, biology, and physics
* Significant autonomy in technical decision\\-making and platform direction
* Opportunity to shape infrastructure that could accelerate development of life\\-saving medicines
* Competitive compensation and equity
* **Location** 
 : Delhi, India (hybrid/flexible arrangements considered for exceptional candidates)



  





**To Apply**
