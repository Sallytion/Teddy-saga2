**Within three months** 
 , you’ll take ownership of components related to specialized indexing, making measurable improvements to performance and reliability.
   

  

**After six months** 
 , you’ll play a key role in advancing hybrid search capabilities and help shape the roadmap for future indexing and search features.
   

  

**You Have**
* Passion for databases, indexing systems, and high\\-performance distributed architectures.
* A strong background in backend or systems programming, preferably with Go, C/C\\+\\+, or Rust.
* Experience working on indexing or query execution systems such as vector, text, or spatial search.
* Solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems.
* Curiosity about AI\\-driven and hybrid workloads that combine structured and unstructured data.
* A focus on building reliable, maintainable, and high\\-performance software.
* Collaborative mindset and ability to work effectively with a distributed global team.
* Typically 6 to 10 years of experience building large\\-scale, production\\-grade systems.


**The Team**
 The SQL Queries team is one of the most impactful and technically challenging groups at Cockroach Labs. Joining the Specialized Indexing subteam means working at the frontier of databases and AI, helping shape how CockroachDB powers intelligent, hybrid applications.
   

  

 You’ll be part of a small, autonomous team based in India, collaborating with engineers and leaders across the world. You’ll have the chance to own complex, high\\-visibility features that directly influence how customers use CockroachDB.
