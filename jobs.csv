 We are an early\\-stage technology startup building a complex, multi\\-sided digital product. This role sits at the intersection of product thinking and engineering, with full ownership over how ideas translate into real, scalable systems.
   

  

 You will work closely with the founder and an external development agency, owning end\\-to\\-end product logic, technical decisions, and quality. This is a foundational role for someone who enjoys shaping systems from first principles and wants meaningful ownership in what they build.
   

  

 This is not a pure coding role and not a people\\-management role. It is a build\\-the\\-right\\-foundations role.
   

  

**What You Will Do**
**1\\. Product \\& System Ownership**
 • Translate product concepts into clear system flows, data models, APIs, and state transitions
   

 • Define acceptance criteria, failure scenarios, and test expectations for features before development begins
   

 • Ensure product intent is accurately reflected in implementation — not just happy\\-path behavior
   

 • Define and validate logic for user journeys, permissions, workflows, and edge cases
   

  

**2\\. Technical Architecture \\& Decision\\-Making**
 • Review and shape backend architecture, mobile\\-facing system design, API contracts, and data structures
   

 • Identify scalability challenges, logic gaps, and security or payment\\-related issues early
   

 • Make pragmatic technical decisions suitable for an early\\-stage product
   

  

**3\\. Engineering Oversight \\& Quality Control**
 • Act as the technical owner while working with an external development agency
   

 • Review code quality, implementation correctness, and feature completeness
   

 • Review implementations for logic completeness, edge cases, and real\\-world usage scenarios
   

 • Push back on shortcuts, assumptions, and poor architectural decisions
   

 • Ensure clean documentation and handovers
   

  

**4\\. Hands\\-on Problem Solving**
 • Read, review, debug, refactor, and modify code when required
   

 • Implement targeted improvements or fixes for critical flows when necessary
   

 Who You Are
   

 • 5–8 years of strong engineering experience
   

 • Experience working on mobile\\-first products
   

 • Strong understanding of mobile app architecture, API\\-driven frontends, state management, performance, and release cycles
   

 • Comfortable reviewing and guiding development for iOS/Android apps (native or cross\\-platform)
   

 • Solid understanding of backend systems, APIs, and system design
   

 • Product\\-minded with a strong focus on correctness, edge cases, and long\\-term impact
   

 • Comfortable working in ambiguity and evolving requirements
   

 • Ownership\\-driven and detail\\-oriented
   

  

 (Hands\\-on mobile app coding experience is a plus)
   

  

**What This Role Is Not**
 • Not a pure coding role
   

 • Not a people\\-management role
   

 • Not a maintenance role
   

  

**Why Join**
 • High ownership and real impact
   

 • Direct collaboration with the founder
   

 • Opportunity to shape a product from first principles
   

 • Long\\-term growth into senior technical leadership","Business Consulting and Services","https://in.linkedin.com/company/tact-telo","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFGxMgIUD5b4w/company-logo_100_100/B56Zq.tzCiIcAQ-/0/1764136268358/tact_telo_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=i03BMYwT1ed77ibnG_1zAdedUPw4I6uYc-97rlTIawU","","","","","","","","","","",""
