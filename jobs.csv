As we grow, we need engineers who go beyond feature delivery. We’re looking for full\\-stack developers who want to build enduring systems, make practical decisions, and help us ship great products with high velocity.
 



  





**What You’ll Do** 



* Work with product, design, and support teams to turn real customer problems into thoughtful, scalable solutions.
* Design and build robust backend systems, services, and APIs that prioritize long\\-term maintainability and performance.

* Document your decisions clearly and communicate trade\\-offs with both technical and non\\-technical stakeholders.



  





**What Makes You a Strong Fit** 



* You’ve built and maintained real\\-world software systems, ideally at meaningful scale or complexity.
* You think in systems and second\\-order effects—not just in ticket\\-by\\-ticket outputs.
* You prefer well\\-reasoned defaults over overengineering.

 Values we’ve lived by over these last 14 years:
 




  





**We think like inventors.**




*\\>Invent the answer you wish existed. If it already exists, ask how it could exist better.\\<* 




 We build for the love of it. And we build the best.
 



 We don’t just copy and paste. We start from first principles—frame the problem, question the default, ship, improve, repeat—until it’s world\\-class.
 



 Every version and experiment is a chance to push past our comfort zone and hone our craft. It isn’t easy—it takes patience and persistence—but it ends in work we’re proud of.
 



  





**Ownership builds a rocket ship.**




*\\>It’s not the hours you put in your work that count; it’s the work you put in the hours.\\<* 




 We’re here to build the business. When we see a problem, we own it end‑to‑end. We pull in the right people, ask for help early, track just enough to finish, and close the loop. We focus on what moves the needle, cut low‑impact work, and push hard when it counts—then recover.
 



 That focus builds subject mastery. It helps get in the flow. It fuels passion and can spark
 ***healthy***
 friction—and that’s all part of the game.
 ***We make a fuss when it matters,***
 and once a call is made, we commit to it fully—whether we all agree or disagree.
 



  





**Run to the roar.**




*\\>Step up to stand tall.\\<* 




 Greatness is a moving target.
 



 Chase excellence in your craft and take on bigger problems. Grow into a full\\-stack problem\\-solver and leader—whatever your domain. Improve with intent, work with people who push you, and never get too comfortable. That’s how we level up.
 



  





**How’s the team?** 



* Open and flat hierarchy
* High\\-agency work with a get\\-stuff\\-done attitude
* Teams that focus on creating wins \\- for the org, the team and one's self \\- all fuelled by mentorship and empowerment



  





**Benefits** 



* Relocation benefits \\- we’ll book your domestic travel if you are not in Bangalore and help you with 2 weeks of accommodation
* Homemade lunch at the office and a pantry with snacks, fresh coffee \\& tea
* All the IT essentials and tools you’ll need to be successful in your role, everyone at the office gets an external monitor, ergonomic seating and a mechanical keyboard
* Frequent outings, company\\-sponsored outdoor events, celebrations for milestones, trips for the entire team and sponsorships to participate at international company events at exotic destinations
* Profit\\-sharing bonuses based on company growth, tenure and performance
* Paid time off \\- maternity, paternity, and marriage leave
