 We’re building an
 ****AI\\-native platform for finance****
 —a multi\\-agent system that reimagines how investment teams make decisions and how financial professionals work. We’re a scrappy, data\\-driven, and customer\\-focused startup backed by Tier\\-1 VC, transforming financial operations with AI\\-driven workflow automation.
   

  

 This isn’t just another internship. It’s a chance to
 ****learn by building real systems****
 , explore different areas of engineering, and help define the future of an entire industry.
   

  

 As an
 ****Engineering Intern****
 , you’ll work on real production systems alongside experienced engineers, designers, and product leaders.
   

  

**You’ll Have The Opportunity To**
* Start in an area that matches your current strengths, or
* Explore across teams (frontend, backend, data, AI/ML) and discover what excites you most


 We don’t expect interns to know everything upfront. We care far more about
 ****curiosity, strong fundamentals, and the willingness to learn****
 . Over the course of the internship, you’ll gradually take ownership of meaningful features while receiving mentorship and support.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
 Depending on your interests and strengths, you may work on one or more of the following:
   

  

* Build and improve production\\-grade software across frontend, backend, data, or AI systems
* Develop APIs, services, orchestration layers, or data pipelines using Python and modern cloud tools
* Create intuitive and responsive user interfaces using React, TypeScript, and modern frontend frameworks
* Work with AI/ML pipelines, including GenAI workflows, LLMs, RAG systems, and agent\\-based architectures
* Design clean abstractions and APIs, translating complex technical or financial logic into maintainable code
* Collaborate with engineers, product managers, designers, and domain experts to solve real customer problems
* Prototype ideas, gather feedback, and iterate—while learning how systems scale in production
* Gradually take ownership of components as your confidence and experience grow


 You won’t be expected to do all of this at once. Your scope will evolve based on your interests, growth, and team needs.
   

  

**Who This Role Is For**
 We welcome candidates who are:
   

  

* Currently pursuing or recently completed a BS or MS in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, or a related field
* Comfortable with at least one programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript)
* Curious about building real systems and excited to learn how production software works
* Familiar with software engineering basics like version control, testing, and clean code—even if mostly through projects or coursework
* Able to think in terms of problems and interfaces, not just implementations
* Comfortable asking questions, learning from feedback, and iterating quickly
* Interested in startups, ownership, and working in fast\\-moving environments


 You
 ****do not****
 need prior experience in every area listed below to apply.
   

  

**Areas You Might Explore (Nice To Have, Not Required)**
****Frontend****
* React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, or Framer Motion
* Data visualization (Chart.js, Recharts, etc.)
* State management (React Query, XState)
* Responsive and mobile\\-first design


****Backend****
* Python web frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, etc.)
* APIs, distributed systems, or event\\-driven architectures
* Databases (PostgreSQL, Redis)


****Data \\& Infrastructure****
* SQL or NoSQL databases
* ETL pipelines or workflow orchestration (e.g., Airflow)
* Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), Docker, or Kubernetes


****AI / ML****
* PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Scikit\\-Learn
* LLM tools (LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI API, Hugging Face)
* RAG systems, embeddings, or AI agents


 You’re encouraged to
 ****specialize deeply in one area****
**or**
****sample across multiple areas****
 —both paths are valued.

If you've made a career transition (or a few!), you’re self taught in a new role, or you have skills/experience you’d like to highlight, we want to hear more about what you could bring to the table.
