 Healthcare should work for patients, but it doesn’t. In their time of need, they call down outdated insurance directories. Then wait on hold. Then wait weeks for the privilege of a visit. Then wait in a room solely designed for waiting. Then wait for a surprise bill. In any other consumer industry, the companies delivering such a poor customer experience would not survive. But in healthcare, patients lack market power. Which means they are expected to accept the unacceptable.
   

  

 Zocdoc’s mission is to give power to the patient. To do that, we’ve built the leading healthcare marketplace that makes it easy to find and book in\\-person or virtual care in all 50 states, across \\+200 specialties and \\+12k insurance plans. By giving patients the ability to see and choose, we give them power. In doing so, we can make healthcare work like every other consumer sector, where businesses compete for customers, not the other way around. In time, this will drive quality up and prices down.
   

  

 We’re 18 years old and the leader in our space, but we are still just getting started. If you like solving important, complex problems alongside deeply thoughtful, driven, and collaborative teammates, read on.
   

  

**Your Impact on Our Mission**
 Zocdoc’s greatest asset is its people — and as a Staff Software Engineer on the Provider Onboarding team, you will play a critical role in shaping how healthcare providers join and thrive on our platform. Your work will directly influence how quickly and seamlessly providers connect with patients, enabling Zocdoc to deliver on its mission of giving power to the patient.
   

  

 You will provide technical leadership and architect scalable solutions that simplify one of healthcare’s most complex challenges: onboarding providers efficiently, accurately, and at scale. This role is central to building a next\\-generation onboarding platform that automates data ingestion, integrates with external systems (EHRs, insurance, and vendor pipelines), and activates providers instantly across multiple booking channels.
   

  

 Your contributions will help transform a manual, people\\-intensive process into an intelligent, automated system capable of onboarding hundreds of thousands of providers effortlessly—improving provider satisfaction, reducing errors, and strengthening trust in Zocdoc’s multi\\-product ecosystem.
   

  

**You’ll enjoy this role if you are…**
* Inspired by the opportunity to positively impact the healthcare experience for millions of customers and providers
* Passionate about building highly scalable platforms with the latest technologies, and excited about developing new and innovative products
* Product\\-driven with a relentless focus on user needs, and excited to partner closely with cross\\-functional teams, leading projects beginning from the early ideation phase
* A fervent champion of engineering fundamentals and enjoys driving adoption of best practices in code health, testing, and maintainability across organisations and teams
* A leader who mentors and grows teams, cultivates innovation and drives cross\\-collaboration across multiple teams
* A believer that diverse and inclusive teams and cultures are non\\-negotiable
* An entrepreneur with strong ownership who can thrive in an ambiguous and fast\\-changing environment


**Your day\\-to\\-day is…**
* Own the technical direction and architecture for Zocdoc’s Provider Onboarding platform, ensuring scalability, reliability, and extensibility across products and teams.
* Drive Zocdoc’s expansion into new and innovative offerings, taking technical ownership from roadmapping and prototyping through execution of 0→1 initiatives that span the company’s technology stack.
* Analyse and decompose complex product challenges to inform sound, scalable design decisions and guide long\\-term technical strategy.
* Design and build automation frameworks that transform manual onboarding workflows into intelligent, data\\-driven systems.
* Integrate with external data sources and systems (EHRs, insurance partners, and vendor pipelines) to enable frictionless provider activation.
* Leverage emerging technologies—such as LLMs and intelligent search—to enrich provider data and scale onboarding intelligently.
* Collaborate cross\\-functionally with Product, Design, Data, and Operations teams to translate business goals into robust technical solutions.
* Mentor and elevate engineers through code and design reviews, technical guidance, and by driving best practices in architecture and data quality.
* Champion a culture of engineering excellence, leading by example in code quality, performance, and operational ownership.


**You’ll be successful in this role if you have…**
* Successfully shipped code for a complex, user\\-facing product, with experience working across multiple areas of the technology stack
* Demonstrated history of solid and well\\-rounded system design skills
* Improved developer productivity, efficiency and velocity by setting up the best practices for coding, testing, deployment and observability
