 The fashion industry is responsible for \\~10% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and more than 90% of its emissions stem from the supply chain. Most fashion brands and retailers lack actual supply chain data and therefore, struggle to meet environmental impact disclosure regulations. The existing software solutions are generic and lack industry\\-specific insights like the impacts of recycled and organic materials, manufacturing technologies used across different fabrics \\& products, and the ability to collect and integrate energy resource consumption data from suppliers. 
 



  
 



 This is why we created Carbon Trail, a software platform tailored to the fashion industry. Leveraging data and AI/ML, our product provides instantaneous product environment footprint (PEF) reports and critical analytics that cover the lifecycle of any fashion product. This helps fashion retailers and brands accurately measure the environmental footprints of their products which can then be used to create digital product passports, get a deeper understanding of their Scope 3 emissions, and identify emission reduction initiatives to meet their net\\-zero goals. 
 



  
 



 Among our founders, we have experience leading the development of groundbreaking data, IoT, and AI/ML products at Microsoft and other startups. We also have hands\\-on experience building climate strategies for global clients and implementing clean\\-energy solutions like solar. We believe climate change is the greatest challenge facing humanity and want to dedicate our careers to fighting against it. 
 



  
 



**What You Will Do** 




  
 



 We're looking for a full\\-stack software engineer who can work on both the backend (AI/ML stack, APIs) and front end (customer\\-facing web app). You will work directly with the CTO on multiple segments of the product as it evolves which will include designing and implementing: 
 


* Leveraging AI to extract useful information from unstructured data and fill gaps using intelligent machine learning based heuristics.
* Evolve the front\\-end application using the latest open\\-source technologies in the market like React/NextJS, Tailwind, etc.
* Build integrations with ERP/PLM systems used by brands/retailers to fetch data in real\\-time.
* Augment our LCA engine to cover a wider range of materials, products \\& processes as we grow.



  
 



**What Will Make You A Great Fit** 




  
 



 Can you thrive in an early\\-stage environment: small team, fast\\-moving, with lots of ownership and willingness to do what it takes to keep shipping? 
 



 or  
 



 Do you have significant experience in an early\\-stage environment, especially as a CTO or an early employee? 
 



  
 



 In addition, possessing the following technical skills will make you an excellent fit: 
 



  
 


* 3\\+ years of experience developing frontend and backend systems
* Strong computer science fundamentals (Data Structures and Algorithms, OS primitives) and ability to design systems end\\-to\\-end
* Familiarity with SaaS infrastructure components like AuthN/AuthZ, multi\\-tenant architectures, observability etc.
* Highly skilled in Object Oriented Programming in languages such as C\\#, Java, Typescript, Python
* Experience working with databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL and frameworks like React/NextJS, ASP.NET
* Fundamentals of AI/Machine Learning



  
 



 We believe strong engineers can pick up new languages and frameworks very quickly so even if you don't have experience with some of them mentioned above, please do reach out if our mission is close to your heart too.
