**About Stripe**
 Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.
   

  

**About The Team**
 Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early\\-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.
   

  

 What you’ll do
   

  

 As a company, we believe in end\\-to\\-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open\\-source software.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Work on cross\\-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
* Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
* Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
* Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills


 Who you are
   

  

 We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
   

  

**Minimum Requirements**
* A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2026, or equivalent work experience
* Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
* Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi\\-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
* Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts


**Preferred Qualifications**
* One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
* Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
* Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases


 In\\-office expectations
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in\\-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in\\-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.
   

  

 Pay and benefits
   

  

 Stripe does not yet include pay ranges in job postings in every country. Stripe strongly values pay transparency and is working toward pay transparency globally.","Software Development, Financial Services, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/stripe","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQE2ZfJyfn-VCg/company-logo_100_100/B56ZlyKwpUKIAQ-/0/1758557047806/stripe_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=fRMcaMGPJNFUMq_l1f2zzyX4PaK3yg-MRicyUuY3qSI","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Rocketium is an
 **AI Creative Studio** 
 that helps global brands scale their marketing content production with speed, efficiency, and consistency. Most marketing teams struggle with repetitive creative work like resizing, versioning, renaming, and ensuring every asset meets brand or retailer requirements. These tasks slow down campaigns and drive up costs.
   

  

 Our AI Studio combines AI agents, expert supervision, and design SaaS. Simply upload a production brief, and watch AI Agents spring into action. These AI Agents, which are tuned by our experts to your brand, understand your brief, gather relevant assets and design templates, and best practices about publishing channels, to then generate entire campaigns in minutes. Our experts oversee this process through reviews and fine\\-tune our AI to prevent hallucinations, while also offering design services and revisions at significantly lower costs than traditional agencies.
   

  

 Brands like Amazon, Electrolux, Colgate\\-Palmolive, General Mills, and Omnicom Group utilize Rocketium to expand their reach, engage broader audiences, and drive digital sales and e\\-commerce growth.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
 At Rocketium, engineers aren’t just writing code. We’re building the engine that powers creativity at scale. Imagine helping a global brand launch hundreds of personalized ads in a day instead of weeks, or designing workflows where AI takes care of the grunt work so humans can focus on storytelling. That’s the kind of impact your code will have here.
   

  

**As a Senior Software Engineer With Us, You Will**
* Bring ideas to life: Work with product managers and designers to turn messy, real\\-world creative challenges into elegant software solutions.
* Build for scale: Write reliable, performant code that can handle thousands of assets being generated, automated, and personalized every day.
* Shape the future of AI workflows: Experiment with AI/automation to create features that change how creative teams think about production.
* Make the platform better, every day: Debug tricky issues, optimize performance, and refactor where needed — because we value craft as much as speed.
* Grow with the team: Share openly, learn from peers, and give feedback that sharpens everyone’s work.


**Who You Are**
* You've been building SaaS products for 5\\+ years.
* Your toolkit includes JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Node.js, and you’re quick to pick up new tools as needed.
* You’re comfortable switching hats: debugging tricky issues one moment, brainstorming workflows with designers the next.
* Ambiguity doesn’t scare you; you enjoy finding clarity where none exists.
* Bonus points if you’ve dabbled in AI, workflow automation, or creative tech.
* Most importantly, you embody our prime directives.


**Beyond The Pay\\-cheque**
* ⚙️ Engineer at scale, impact at scale: Every line of code you write directly shapes how thousands of creative assets get produced, personalized, and delivered. You’re not building features; you’re building the backbone of how modern marketing works.
* 🎯 8\\-4\\-5 working hours: We make sure you balance work and life while achieving your goals.
* 🌴 Unlimited leave policy: We mean it. Time off is important, and we trust you to take it when you need it.
* 💪 Physical \\& mental wellness: We’ve partnered with Cult.Fit to sponsor/subsidize your fitness and therapy goals. Your well\\-being matters as much as your wireframes.
* 💆🏽 In\\-office relaxation therapy: Sitting for long hours definitely calls for frequent muscle relaxation sessions and our physio therapists take care of that for you.
* 🏥 Comprehensive health cover (OPD included): For you and your loved ones \\- spouse, kids, and parents.
* 📚 Learning budget: Conferences, design tools, masterclasses \\- if it helps you grow, we’ll support it.
* 🥗 Meals \\& munchies: Good food \\= better ideas. We keep our pantry and plates full.


**What Your First 30 Days Will Look Like**
 🚀
 **Week 1\\-2: Get set, build fast.**
 You’ll dive into Rocketium’s engineering ecosystem: setting up your environment, exploring our codebase, and shadowing on\\-calls to understand how we keep things running. Expect to ship your first bug fix or small component fast, so you get hands\\-on with our stack right away.
   

  

 🛠️
 **Week 3\\-4: Start making real impact.**
 By now, you’ll be pairing with senior engineers, taking ownership of a small feature, and joining sprint rituals. You’ll see how product, design, and engineering come together, and you’ll be adding your own lines of code into the mix.
   

  

 ⚡
 **Week 4\\-8: From contributor to owner.**
 You’ll move from bug fixes to building features end\\-to\\-end. This means writing tests, pushing your first PRs, and seeing your work go live for real customers. You’ll also start spotting opportunities to make our systems faster, cleaner, and more reliable.
   

  

 By the end of your first month, you won’t just know how Rocketium’s tech works, you’ll already have shipped code that powers creative workflows for global brands.
