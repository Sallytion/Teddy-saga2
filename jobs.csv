Our 2023\\-26 Sustainability strategy, called “Roots of resilience”, focuses on protecting natural ecosystems, addressing climate change, and embedding sustainable practices across our operations.
   

  

**Our Pillars**
* Valuing nature: How we impact nature affects how nature impacts us. Resilient ecosystems \\- the foundation of a sustainable planet and society – are essential to our future. We’re committed to protecting and restoring nature – from mangrove forests to the bees in our backyard – by increasing biodiversity awareness and inspiring clients and colleagues to put nature at the heart of their plans.
* Addressing climate change: The effects of a changing climate are far\\-reaching and significant. Unpredictable weather, increasing temperatures, and rising sea levels cause both social inequalities and environmental disruption. We're building a net zero strategy, developing insurance products and services, and mobilizing to advance thought leadership and investment in societal\\-led solutions.
* Integrating ESG: All companies have a role to play in building a more resilient future. Incorporating ESG considerations into our internal processes and practices builds resilience from the roots of our business. We’re training our colleagues, engaging our external partners, and evolving our sustainability governance and reporting.
* AXA Hearts in Action: We have established volunteering and charitable giving programs to help colleagues support causes that matter most to them, known as AXA XL’s “Hearts in Action” programs. These include our Matching Gifts program, Volunteering Leave, and our annual volunteering day – the Global Day of Giving.

 We're a high\\-agency startup solving real\\-world problems with elegant tech.
 



 Our mission: build world\\-class systems from scratch that are lean, fast, and intelligent. We’re currently operating in stealth mode, crafting deeply technical products involving Kotlin, React, Azure, AWS, GCP, Google Maps, and algorithmically intense backends.
 



 If you’re tired of working as a ticket taker and want to build, lead, and own your work end\\-to\\-end — we’re your people.
 



  





**What You'll Do** 



* Own systems end\\-to\\-end — from design, development, deployment to monitoring.
* Architect robust and scalable services, especially in Kotlin (or similar JVM languages).
* Build fast, clean UIs in React that can scale with feature complexity.
* Work closely with founders and product stakeholders to translate real problems into tech solutions.
* Make critical decisions on cloud architecture using AWS, Azure and/or GCP.
* Optimise performance and apply algorithms that give us a tech edge.
* Contribute to the product and engineering roadmap with a strong voice.
* Write clean, testable, maintainable code that you’re proud of.



  





**We’re Looking For** 



* ""n"" years of deep hands\\-on engineering experience, not just development. We don't care if you have 100 years of experience or not even 1 year, just prove you are worth it!
* Strong CS fundamentals: DSA, design patterns, system design.
* Experience with Kotlin or similar (Java/Scala), and modern React.
* Solid knowledge of cloud infra (AWS, Azure, GCP) and deploying scalable systems.
* Experience with Google Maps API or similar integrations is a plus.
* Ownership mentality — you don’t wait for specs, you shape them.
* A “figure it out” mindset — self\\-starters who learn fast and execute faster.
* Bonus: Startup experience, open\\-source contributions, or side projects.



  





**This Role Is Not For You If…** 



* You need hand\\-holding or detailed tasks to start contributing.
* You only want to code what’s assigned and avoid product thinking.
* You prefer a big team structure and layered management.



  





**Why Join Us** 



* Work on 0→1 products with massive ownership and no red tape.
* We value intelligence, initiative, and speed over hierarchy.
* You’ll get a front\\-row seat in building systems and culture from scratch.
* Flexible remote work, flat org, high trust.
* Your impact \\= immediate and visible.
* Be part of the future!

**About the Role :** 




  





 We're building an enterprise ERP system from scratch where AI isn't a feature—it's the foundation.
 



  





 Join Deltek's Engineering and Technology team to create the first truly AI\\-native SMB ERP. Users will chat with their system instead of clicking through forms. Intelligent agents will handle routine tasks autonomously. And you'll use AI to write better code faster.
 



  





 This is a greenfield project. No legacy constraints. No technical debt. Just the opportunity to reimagine what enterprise software can be when designed for AI from day one.
 



  





 As a senior engineer, you'll own significant features that define next\\-generation enterprise software. You'll translate architectural vision into production code, mentor other engineers, and help establish patterns for AI\\-first development.
 



  





  





**Key Responsibilities** 




  




* Implement complex AI\\-powered ERP components across multiple domains following architectural guidance
* Apply prompt engineering frameworks and patterns established by architects across the ERP platform
* Integrate machine learning capabilities including predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems into production features
* Implement microservices and APIs connecting AI capabilities with core ERP business logic according to established patterns
* Collaborate with architects and technical leads on implementation approaches for complex features, providing input on technical feasibility
* Own complex feature development from implementation through delivery, coordinating with product, UX, and other engineering teams
* Ensure quality through comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and proper monitoring instrumentation
* Participate actively in code reviews focusing on code quality, maintainability, and adherence to established patterns
* Mentor intermediate and entry\\-level engineers through pairing, implementation guidance, and technical problem\\-solving
* Identify technical debt in existing code and contribute to refactoring efforts
* Provide technical input to architects based on hands\\-on implementation experience



  





 Qualifications :

* **Frameworks:** 
 Deep experience with Quarkus, Spring Boot, or similar frameworks; understanding of reactive and async patterns
* **Database:** 
 Advanced PostgreSQL skills including writing performant queries, understanding indexing strategies, and implementing multi\\-tenant data isolation patterns

 Advanced Git workflows, CI/CD pipeline usage, containerization (Docker), and modern development practices
* **Cloud Platforms:** 
 Hands\\-on experience implementing solutions on AWS, Azure, or OCI using managed services
* **Observability:** 
 Experience leveraging logging, metrics, and tracing in production systems
* **Leadership:** 
 Strong communication skills and ability to provide technical guidance and mentor engineers



  





**AI\\-First Mindset** 




  





 This role requires embracing an AI\\-first approach where GenAI and agentic AI tools are essential collaborators, not optional supplements. We expect team members who naturally think in AI\\-enhanced workflows and proactively integrate intelligent automation to solve ERP development challenges more efficiently.
 



  





 The ideal candidate has strong interest in prompt engineering techniques and conversational AI systems, with understanding of how to craft effective prompts for business contexts. You should be curious about natural language processing and how AI enhances user experiences, along with basic awareness of AI ethics and prompt safety considerations.
 



  





 We're looking for someone who approaches ERP feature development by first asking: ""How can AI help me build this functionality faster and better?"" This includes being comfortable with rapid AI tool evolution, eager to experiment with new AI capabilities for prompt engineering and ERP optimization, and committed to sharing AI\\-enhanced approaches with the team.
 



  





 We value those who apply prompt engineering to solve real\\-world ERP business problems and see AI as a productivity multiplier for strategic development decisions, rather than a replacement for human expertise.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/deltek","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQHmb8Tvt02Pcw/company-logo_100_100/B4EZp2JOWBHgAQ-/0/1762918721175/deltek_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=_1WPCeOsgOS0QiONvuyHIRRrBkeV6Sm5jaXL-kFtApM","","","","","","","","","","",""
