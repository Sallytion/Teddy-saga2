For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.
   

  

 Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third\\-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.
   

  

 Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1\\.8B\\+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.

 Invoicing and Subscription Management:
   

  

 We are responsible for invoicing, customer billing, and subscription administration.
   

  

 Key Team Functions:

 Country Launches:
   

  

 When launching Rippling in a new country, our primary focus is enabling the sales team to initiate sales and close deals efficiently. This involves understanding local contracts, payment infrastructure, tax regulations, and more.
   

  

 Business Analytics:
