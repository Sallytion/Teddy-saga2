But unlike software (with observability platforms such as AppDynamics and Datadog), construction teams lack automated feedback loops to help projects stay on schedule and on budget. Without this observability, construction wastes a whopping $3T per year because glitches aren’t detected fast enough to recover.
   

  

 Doxel AI exists to bring computer vision to construction, so the industry can deliver what society needs to thrive. From hospitals to data centers, from foreman to VPs of construction, teams use Doxel to make better decisions everyday. In fact, Doxel has contributed to the construction of the facilities that provide many of the products and services you use everyday.
   

  

 We have classic computer vision, deep learning ML object detection, a low\\-latency 3D three.js web app, a complex data pipeline powering it all in the background. We’re building out new workflows, analytics dashboards, and forecasting engines.
   

  

 We’re at an exciting stage of scale as we build upon our growing market momentum. Our software is trusted by Shell Oil, Genentech, HCA healthcare, Kaiser, Turner, Layton and several others. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
   

  

**The Role:**

You’ll collaborate closely with our product, frontend, computer vision, and 3D teams to design seamless end\\-to\\-end solutions—from field data capture to actionable insights that affect real lives. If you love solving problems that matter to the world at scale and thrive in a fast\\-paced, mission\\-driven team—this role is for you.
   

  

**Who You Are:**
 You’re a backend engineer with deep curiosity and a strong grasp of building distributed systems. You care about clean, efficient code, resilient infrastructure, and scalable architectures. You’re hungry to solve tough technical problems and improve systems that directly impact the real world—especially in industries like construction where every decision counts.Bonus: you’ve worked on data\\-heavy platforms or have experience integrating machine learning/computer vision pipelines into production.
   

  

**What You’ll Do:**
* Design, build, and scale robust backend systems and pipelines for data ingestion, processing, and analytics
* Develop high\\-performance APIs that power real\\-time 3D visualizations, dashboards, and mobile tools
* Build and optimize data pipelines that support models and business logic at scale
* Collaborate across CV/ML, frontend, design, and product teams to deliver end\\-to\\-end features
* Ensure system reliability, observability, monitoring, and graceful degradation for mission\\-critical tools
* Leverage, AI tools, cloud infrastructure, containerization, and CI/CD best practices
* perform thoughtful code reviews, and drive backend engineering best practices


**What You Bring to Doxel:**
* 8\\+ years of professional experience as a backend or systems engineer
* Strong proficiency in modern backend languages like Python, Go, or Node.js
* Have a test driven development approach. You are someone who believes testing is not an afterthought—it's the foundation. You write tests before code, care deeply about code quality, and value software you can trust
* Experience in designing and maintaining complex systems
* You will be a leader for an end\\-to\\-end product development team and will set the bar for Doxel

* Comfortable with CI/CD, monitoring, testing, and automation
* Excellent debugging, profiling, and system design skills
* Great communicator and collaborator; able to break down complex problems clearly
* Bonus: experience working with computer vision models, 3D data, or unstructured media pipelines
