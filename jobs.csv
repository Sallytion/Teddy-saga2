* Drive deep performance analysis and profiling (CPU, memory, I/O, network) to identify bottlenecks and optimize application code, runtime behavior, and infrastructure efficiency across distributed systems.
* Build and standardize performance observability using Splunk, SignalFx, Datadog, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry (metrics/logs/traces), creating dashboards that surface latency breakdowns, saturation signals, error rates, and critical dependency health.
* Lead UI performance engineering by establishing measurable standards and regression checks for web apps (e.g., Core Web Vitals: LCP/INP/CLS), using browser profiling tools, and correlating UI responsiveness with backend latency and API behavior.
* Drive Kubernetes and AWS performance tuning, including autoscaling behavior, resource requests/limits, node sizing, networking, and cost/performance tradeoffs.
* Design and implement performance test frameworks (e.g., Python/Locust, k6/JMeter optional) with reusable scenarios, datasets, and workflow libraries for realistic end\\-to\\-end user journeys (UI → API → event\\-driven backend → data stores).
* Evaluate performance of distributed workflows including microservices and event\\-driven pipelines (e.g., Kafka producers/consumers, retries/backoff, queue lag), caching layers (e.g., Redis), and multi\\-tenant databases (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL) with a focus on latency and throughput at scale.
* Create internal tools and self\\-service platforms (Performance\\-as\\-a\\-Service) to automate benchmarks, integrate performance regression checks into CI/CD, and generate standardized reports, dashboards, and runbooks for engineering teams.
* Develop AI/ML performance testing practices for LLM/agentic workflows: stage\\-level latency decomposition, token/throughput behavior, streaming response performance, rate\\-limit handling, retries/backoff tuning, and dependency bottleneck analysis.
* Partner in design and architecture reviews, providing performance/capacity guidance on new services, data flows, authentication/authorization paths, and tenant isolation behaviors that impact scalability and reliability.
* Communicate insights and recommendations to technical and leadership stakeholders through clear reports, postmortems, performance reviews, and data\\-backed prioritization.


**Minimum Qualifications**
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field (or equivalent practical experience).
* 8\\+ years of experience in performance engineering, systems engineering, SRE, or related roles supporting distributed, cloud\\-native systems.
* Strong experience with AWS and performance tuning in cloud environments (compute, networking, storage, load balancing).
* Hands\\-on experience with Kubernetes, microservices architectures, and Docker.
* Proven experience with observability/monitoring tools such as Splunk, SignalFx, Datadog, Grafana (metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, alerting).
* Strong programming/scripting ability (e.g., Python; familiarity with services written in Go/Java is a plus).
* Demonstrated ability to drive cross\\-team technical execution, influence architecture decisions, and operate effectively with geographically distributed stakeholders.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Experience testing and optimizing UI performance for enterprise web applications, including performance budgets, regression checks, and profiling using browser dev tools (and/or RUM where available).
* Experience with capacity planning and forecasting, including headroom targets, scaling playbooks, and performance risk assessment.
* Experience testing and optimizing AI/ML systems, including LLM\\-based workflows, orchestration layers, and RAG/agent pipelines.
* Experience with OpenTelemetry instrumentation and end\\-to\\-end distributed tracing in microservices.
* Familiarity with production profiling approaches such as pprof (Go), JFR/async\\-profiler (Java), py\\-spy (Python), flamegraphs, and/or eBPF\\-based profiling.
* Experience with event\\-driven and data\\-intensive architectures (e.g., Kafka, async processing, streaming pipelines) and performance characteristics at scale.
* Experience building internal developer platforms and frameworks that increase productivity (standard templates, test harnesses, automated reporting, dashboard generators).
* Familiarity with multi\\-tenant SaaS concerns that affect performance (authN/authZ flows, tenant isolation, noisy\\-neighbor prevention).


**Tooling \\& Technology Expectations (for the role)**
* Cloud \\& Runtime: AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Linux
* Observability: Splunk, SignalFx, Datadog, Grafana, OpenTelemetry

 Software Development
   

  

**Job Description**
 Hey there!
   

  

 We are looking for a curious developer to join our
 **Backend** 
 team at Procedure. We are a product development company established in early 2017\\. Before we dive into the job description, allow us to introduce ourselves.
   

  

 Our team is a mixed bag. Of the smart and the hard workers. Of the organised and slightly chaotic. Of the early risers and the burners of the midnight oil. We appreciate diversity and truly like having differing perspectives in the room.
   

  

 We pride ourselves on being early adopters of the latest tools, libraries and frameworks while consistently delivering business value. People who work with us fall in love with their craft. We have changed the definition of ""work"" for them.
   

  

**Here Are Some Of Our Beliefs About Work**
* Work is only 1 part of your life and not your entire life. We treat it as such.
* Weekends are sacred and not to be messed around with. So you won't be asked to work on one.
* Commuting is a waste of time. Working from home saves you additional time. Go crazy with it.
* Side gigs are welcome. We believe there are multiple avenues to learn and grow. So why restrict it only to work?
* Asynchronous by\\-default. Synchronous communication is expensive, so we default to writing docs and literature to enable async communication.
* Good things come in pairs. Errors get halved. Productivity, ideas and fun get doubled. Learning gets accelerated exponentially.
* Learning from mistakes. If you are not making mistakes and learning from them, you are not growing.


 Apart from work, we continually invest in growing you as a professional and a human.
   

  

* Extensive Boot Camp \\- get to learn, regardless of your experience, about Data Structure and Algorithms, LLD, HLD, DevOps, frontend, backend and/or test engineering.
* Book club \\- broaden your horizons by picking up a book every month and have fun doing so
* P1, The Half Yearly Tech Conference \\- here's where we explore futuristic themes to keep you informed about what's happening in the tech space outside our office.
* Internal Projects \\- where your craft, experiment and learning precedence over deadlines. Also, try out new technologies and domains.


**Growth requires mentorship**
 We believe choosing a mentor is more important than choosing a company. My co\\-founder, Braj, and I have more than a decade of experience in our respective fields. I will be mentoring you to become a better engineer and a coder. Braj will help you with domain expertise, product thinking and problem\\-solving. Ask us how it has helped our ex\\-employees in their careers when you chat with us.
   

  

**What's It Like Here**
 We love debating over languages and frameworks and want someone who can bring their opinions to these discussions. We love reading/sharing articles, podcasts, and tech essays. If you are someone who loves tea or coffee, Marvel or DC, Peterson or Zizek, or even something eclectic, you will feel right at home. Continuous improvement is at the heart of everything we do at work \\& outside.
   

  

**This sounds good. But what exactly will you work on?**
 Since we are a service company, you will have the advantage of working on a wide gamut of problems, technology \\& real world\\-wise. You will be involved in all stages of a product lifecycle. You'll never have to wonder why you are working on something because you'll always know it.
   

  

**What are you currently working on?**
 We carefully select our clients. This is to ensure we are always indexed well on challenging work. They include indie entrepreneurs, Series B/C funded startups and big corporates.
   

  

 Some of the sectors we are working on
   

  

* Healthtech
* Edtech
* Insurtech
* Sportstech
* Fintech
* And much more!


 Trust us, there's never a dull day at work.
   

  

**Here’s What We Expect From You**
* You love coding and think of it as a craft. We wouldn’t have it otherwise.
* You have a solid grasp of the basics of Python or JavaScript/TypeScript.
* You’ve built and maintained REST APIs using frameworks like Django/Django Rest Framework (Python) or Express/Fastify (Node.js).
* You understand persistence and can work your way around Django ORM or any SQL/NoSQL store confidently.
* You can set up and own your stack on a cloud provider of your choice.
* You have a good understanding of SOLID principles — enough to know when they help and when they don’t.
* You aren’t complacent about your skillset and have a hunger to learn more.
* You like to share your learnings with others.


 If you have made it this far, I think we should have a chat.
