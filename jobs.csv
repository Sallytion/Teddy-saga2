 Cozmo is building AI employees, fully multimodal agents that see, speak, think, and do. We are starting with financial services and insurance, where operations are complex, regulated, and still heavily human\\-driven.
   

  

 Our AI employees handle high\\-stakes workflows with human\\-level reasoning and communication: real\\-time customer conversations, claims, underwriting, onboarding, and collections. We are building the infrastructure layer for AI\\-native banks and insurers, and we want Cozmo to become the operating system for how work gets done in these institutions.
   

  

 Cozmo is backed by top US investors and is scaling quickly. The ambition is simple and bold: an AI workforce that works as naturally as humans, at a scale humans cannot match.
   

  

**The Role**
 You will be one of the earliest senior engineers in the company, and the first wave of leaders in India. This is a role for someone who wants to own real product, not tickets. You will design and build core systems, ship directly into production, and work with founders and customers on problems that do not have a playbook yet. You will be part of the group that future hires call “the original team.”
   

  

**What You Will Do**
* Architect and build real\\-time multimodal AI systems (voice, text, vision) optimized for ultra low latency and reliability in production.
* Work directly with the founders and senior engineers on product design, technical architecture, and scaling across cloud and edge environments.
* Own end to end pipelines for speech, reasoning, and action, from model integration and orchestration to APIs and infra.
* Collaborate with early enterprise customers to deploy Cozmo AI employees into real workflows and iterate based on live data and usage.
* Help build our India engineering presence by setting high technical standards, mentoring engineers, and shaping how we work as we grow.


**You Might Be a Fit If You**
* Have built and shipped real products in AI, distributed systems, or real time voice / video. You care about users, not just abstractions.
* Have led projects or small teams before, and enjoy combining high quality hands\\-on coding with technical leadership.
* Are strong in Python or Rust and comfortable with cloud native architectures (AWS or GCP), containers, and pub/sub systems.
* Have worked with LLMs or multimodal models and like making them fast, efficient, and reliable in real products.
* Want to be early at a company that is trying to define a category, not just optimize an existing one.


**Why This Role Is Special**
* You get meaningful equity at a stage where it can still move the needle in your life.
* You work with founder level people in AI, product, and finance, across India, the US, and the Middle East.
* You influence the technical and cultural DNA of Cozmo in India. Future leaders will learn from your code and your decisions.
* You get to work on problems that sit at the frontier of LLMs, real time voice, and enterprise scale.


 If you want to look back and say “I helped build the AI employee company,” this is that moment.
