 Validate relevancy ranking, vector search accuracy, and the quality of retrieved context.
* **Agent Workflows:** 
 Test LLM\\-powered multi\\-step agents for autonomy behaviors, ""looping"" issues, and edge\\-case handling.
* **Model Evaluation:** 
 Evaluate outputs for hallucinations, factual accuracy (specifically for patent law), and consistency using tools like OpenAI/Ollama.
* **Fine\\-Tuning Pipelines:** 
 Validate datasets and monitor training runs to benchmark model performance.



**3\\. Quality Ownership \\& Engineering** 



* **Code Review:** 
 Review frontend and backend code from a testability perspective, identifying anti\\-patterns and suggesting better error handling.

* Performance/Load testing exposure using tools like k6 or Locust.



  





**What We Expect From You** 



* **You are a System Breaker:** 
 You don't just test features; you look for ways the system might fail under stress.
* **You Think Like a Developer:** 
 You can read code to understand where the bugs are likely hiding.
* **You are a Quality Advocate:** 
 You are comfortable challenging implementations when quality or user experience is at risk.
* **You are AI\\-Curious:** 
 You stay updated on the latest in LLMs and agentic frameworks.



  





**What We Offer** 



* Opportunity to work at the intersection of
 **Generative AI**

**About The Role**
 We are seeking a skilled Backend Developer to join our engineering team. Unlike traditional siloed development roles, this position is designed for an engineer who values end\\-to\\-end ownership. You will not only write code but also ensure its performance, reliability, and stability in a live production environment.
   

  

 You will drive performance optimization across our AWS\\-hosted Node.js, GraphQL, and MongoDB stack. This is a hands\\-on development role where ""support"" means engineering solutions to complex production challenges and preventing them from recurring. You will act as a critical bridge between product and engineering, gaining deep system mastery through direct involvement in quality assurance and release cycles.
   

  

**Work Schedule**
**Mandatory Overlap:** 
 You must be available to collaborate with the US team between 11:00 PM IST and 3:00 AM IST.
   

  

**Purpose:** 
 This overlap ensures seamless handoffs, collaborative debugging, and direct interaction with US\\-based product and engineering teams.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
 Core Development \\& Performance Engineering
   

  

 Design \\& Optimize: Write and fine\\-tune complex MongoDB aggregation pipelines for high\\-volume analytics, dashboards, and large dataset operations.
   

  

 Backend Architecture: Maintain and enhance Node.js and GraphQL services, ensuring scalable schemas and efficient resolvers.
   

  

 System Reliability: Take ownership of production uptime by diagnosing and resolving backend issues within the AWS ecosystem (Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, CloudFront).
   

  

 Production Ownership \\& Quality Assurance
   

  

 Release Integrity: Collaborate with QA teams during pre\\-release testing to gain a holistic understanding of new features, ensuring you know the code inside and out before it hits production.
   

  

 Root Cause Analysis: Go beyond ""patching"" bugs. Analyze logs and metrics (CloudWatch, ELB) to identify architectural bottlenecks and implement long\\-term reliability improvements.
   

  

 Incident Response: Participate in on\\-call rotations to maintain service availability, acting as the engineering authority during incident response.
   

  

**Technical Requirements**
**Core Stack:**
 MongoDB: Deep expertise in aggregation frameworks and query optimization is essential.
   

  

 Node.js: Proficiency with Express or Apollo Server.
   

  

 GraphQL: Strong grasp of schema design and resolver implementation.
   

  

 Infrastructure \\& Tooling:
   

  

 AWS: Hands\\-on experience with Beanstalk, EC2, S3, and ELB.
   

  

 Observability: Familiarity with logging tools (CloudWatch, New Relic, or Datadog) to trace data flow and performance issues.
   

  

 DevOps: Experience with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) and deployment troubleshooting is highly preferred.
   

  

**Soft Skills \\& Mindset**

**A UK\\-based Finance Analytics Automation Platform is Looking for:******
**Job Description**
**About:**
 The company is a smart finance automation platform. We help SMEs automate their finance and sales operations by integrating disparate business systems. By automating these tasks we save our customers time, give them confidence in their data, and provide insights that were previously not possible. Both the business and team are fast growing. Now is a very interesting time to join us.
   

  

**How do we do this:**
 Using Python we integrate with 10\\+ Accounting, CRM, and payment platforms, we run asynchronous ELT tasks. Storing the data, normalizing the data so we can work with data from separate systems like they are the same, and build smart automations on top of this. These automations vary from NLP to extract dates from documents, using elastic search to match separate data sources together, or building time based schedules from multiple data sources. Since there are a lot of variables, edge cases, and complex domain knowledge, we heavily rely on automated testing.
   

  

**In this role you will:**
* Work closely with product \\& customer success to create solutions that actually solve the end users problems.
* Create and maintain new 3rd party integrations.
* Create and maintain new automations on top of the imported data.
* Make POCs/MVPs for potential new features.
* Support DevOps efforts.
* Improve the Quality, Scalability, Security, and Reliability of the BE as a whole.


**Who We''''''''re Looking For**
 We''''''''re looking for someone with at least:
   

  

* 5\\+ years of BE development experience.

**A UK\\-based Finance Analytics Automation Platform is Looking for:******
**Job Description**
**About:**
 The company is a smart finance automation platform. We help SMEs automate their finance and sales operations by integrating disparate business systems. By automating these tasks we save our customers time, give them confidence in their data, and provide insights that were previously not possible. Both the business and team are fast growing. Now is a very interesting time to join us.
   

  

**How do we do this:**
 Using Python we integrate with 10\\+ Accounting, CRM, and payment platforms, we run asynchronous ELT tasks. Storing the data, normalizing the data so we can work with data from separate systems like they are the same, and build smart automations on top of this. These automations vary from NLP to extract dates from documents, using elastic search to match separate data sources together, or building time based schedules from multiple data sources. Since there are a lot of variables, edge cases, and complex domain knowledge, we heavily rely on automated testing.
   

  

**In this role you will:**
* Work closely with product \\& customer success to create solutions that actually solve the end users problems.
* Create and maintain new 3rd party integrations.
* Create and maintain new automations on top of the imported data.
* Make POCs/MVPs for potential new features.
* Support DevOps efforts.
* Improve the Quality, Scalability, Security, and Reliability of the BE as a whole.


**Who We''''''''re Looking For**
 We''''''''re looking for someone with at least:
   

  

* 5\\+ years of BE development experience.
