**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

**About the team** 

 The mission of our team is to develop a world\\-class big data platform that will provide value to us, our partners, and our customers by leveraging data. We aim to democratize data, provide self\\-service reporting and analytics tools, and fuel existing and new business/engineering initiatives that are critical to business success.  You will join the Data Engineering Team as a Senior Data Engineer. You will work on building tools, frameworks, and processes to ensure high\\-quality data.
   

  




**About the role** 

 As a world\\-class big data platform, Data Governance must be implemented for the multitude of datasets within Roku. There is a wide variety of data sources with a wide range of schemas available. As a result, it becomes increasingly challenging to develop and maintain automated tests and data validations on a large scale. The data\\-driven nature of Roku, however, requires prompt detection and resolution of data quality issues and utmost confidence in the data.  
   

  




**What you’ll be doing** 
* Building highly scalable, available, fault\\-tolerant distributed data processing systems (batch and streaming systems) processing over 10s of terabytes of data ingested every day and a petabyte\\-sized data warehouse
* Building quality data solutions and refine existing diverse datasets into simplified models encouraging self\\-service
* Building data pipelines that perfect data quality and are resilient to inadequate data sources
* Partner with upstream teams to build test automation for data logging
* Define scalable schema design and custom validators for both offline and online data validations
* Building an online validation framework to minimize “bad” data flowing downstream
* Support downstream teams with data quality discovery and resolution
* Build data discovery frameworks that help with an accurate lineage of data elements and metrics
* Low level systems debugging, performance measurement \\& optimization in large production clusters
* Maintain and support existing platforms and evolve to modern technology stacks and architectures


**We’re excited if you have**

**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

 We’re hiring someone who can actually build, debug, optimize, and ship — not someone who needs StackOverflow to survive every 10 minutes.
 



  





 Pekaabo is a fast\\-paced marketing agency working across AI, tech, SaaS, hospitality, e\\-commerce, and global brands. We’re lean, we move fast, and we don’t have patience for slow thinkers or sloppy work.
 



  





**Who We’re Looking For** 




 A developer who is:
 


* Writes clean, readable, maintainable code — not spaghetti chaos.
* Uses AI tools intelligently to accelerate workflows — not to generate garbage code.
* Understands design enough to avoid creating ugly UX nightmares.
* Can build high\\-performance, responsive websites without relying on a thousand plugins.
* Knows how to Google intelligently but doesn’t depend on it for every function.
* Can take ownership of tasks without asking for “step\\-by\\-step instructions.”
* Executes fast and fixes bugs without excuses.
* Cares about page speed, SEO\\-friendliness, security, and real\\-world usability.



  





**Your Day\\-to\\-Day** 



* Develop fast, responsive, SEO\\-optimized websites and landing pages.
* Build custom functionality (not everything needs a plugin).
* Convert Figma designs into pixel\\-perfect frontends.
* Use AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codeium, Claude, etc.) to accelerate development where it makes sense.
* Work on WordPress, custom stacks, API integrations, and front\\-end frameworks.
* Optimize site speed, structure, user experience, and overall performance.
* Troubleshoot issues like a problem\\-solver — not a problem\\-avoider.
* Collaborate with designers, content, SEO, and marketing teams to deliver final production\\-ready outputs.
* Handle both new builds and maintenance without drama.



  





**Core Skills You MUST Have** 




**Frontend** 



* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (solid, not beginner level)
* Tailwind / Bootstrap
* React / Next.js fundamentals preferred
* Pixel\\-perfect Figma to frontend skills



  





**Backend** 



* PHP (must be comfortable)
* Node.js basics preferred
* API integrations
* Database understanding (MySQL/Postgres)



  





**CMS \\& Systems** 



* WordPress (custom themes, not drag\\-and\\-drop amateur hour)
* WooCommerce basics
* Hosting/server basics (cPanel, DNS, migrations)



  





**AI Skills** 




 (Yes, this matters now. If you hate AI, you're already outdated.)
 


* Ability to use AI tools to speed up:
* Code generation
* Refactoring
* Documentation
* Troubleshooting
* Testing
* Knowledge of AI\\-integrated dev environments (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, etc.)
* Understanding how to validate and correct AI\\-generated code — not blindly trust it



  





**Bonus Skills (Nice to Have but Not Dealbreakers)** 



* Experience with Shopify or Webflow
* Knowledge of security best practices
* Automation tools or AI\\-based development workflows



  





**Experience** 



* **1–2 years** 
 minimum (agency experience helps, but not mandatory)
* If your portfolio shows actual shipped projects that work, load fast, and look clean — you’re good.



  





**Who Should NOT Apply** 




 Let’s save each other time:
 


* If you rely on plugins for everything
* If you write messy, unstructured code
* If you can’t debug your own work
* If you need handholding for basics
* If you blame “system issue” for everything
* If you break something and hide it



  





**Why Work With Pekaabo** 



* Real\\-world projects, global brands, and fast\\-paced growth.
* Freedom to build things your way — as long as the final output is solid.
* Zero bureaucracy, minimal meetings, no corporate fluff.
* A team that values speed, quality, and actual skills — not degrees.



  





 If you’re the kind of developer who builds, ships, and improves — not complains, delays, and excuses — you’ll do well here.","Marketing Services","https://in.linkedin.com/company/pekaabo","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQG7bDAEyB8bZQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1656614510841/pekaabo_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=XUM7yiLnzxCKy21C8W-yQJO4C2nNPRoSlUFBBIbAtOY","","","","","","","","","","",""
