**What Success Looks Like (30/60/90\\):**

* 60 days: Lead an integration from discovery to UAT; establish SLIs/SLOs and dashboards for your integrations.
* 90 days: Template a reusable connector/SDK and playbook adopted by other teams; reduce time‐to‐go‐live across a client cohort.



 Why MediaMint?
