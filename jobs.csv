**Job Purpose**
 We are looking for a Senior UI Developer to build a modern, conversational user interface for an enterprise AI platform. This role focuses on creating a clean, minimal, and highly interactive single\\-page experience where users interact primarily through conversation rather than traditional screens. You will work closely with backend, AI, and SDK teams to translate system responses into intuitive, dynamic UI components. The role involves building complex animations, handling multimodal inputs, ensuring performance inside mobile WebViews, and maintaining high code quality suitable for large\\-scale production systems.
   

  

**Duties And Responsibilities**
 Conversational UI \\& Frontend Development
   

  

* Design and build a single\\-page, conversational UI that replaces traditional multi\\-screen flows.
* Develop dynamic, schema\\-driven UI components that render based on user intent, profile, and system capabilities.
* Implement fluid animations, transitions, and motion systems while ensuring performance inside mobile WebViews and browsers.
* Build support for multimodal inputs and outputs including text, voice, image, and file interactions.
* Ensure UI adapts gracefully across devices, channels (WebView vs browser), and capability constraints. UI Architecture \\& Code Quality
* Contribute to frontend architecture decisions, component design, and state management patterns.
* Build reusable, well\\-structured UI components with clear separation of concerns.
* Ensure code is clean, maintainable, and easy for other developers to understand and extend.
* Work closely with backend teams to consume UI schemas, capability flags, and conversational state. Performance, Security \\& Stability
* Optimize bundle size, rendering performance, and animation smoothness for low\\-end devices.
* Implement fallback and degradation strategies for constrained environments.
* Follow secure frontend practices including CSP compliance, PII masking, and safe handling of user inputs.
* Support analytics, audit events, and session tracking hooks as required by enterprise standards. Collaboration \\& Delivery
* Collaborate with AI, backend, SDK, and product teams to translate conversational responses into effective UI.
* Participate in code reviews, design discussions, and iterative UI improvements.
* Contribute to CI/CD pipelines for frontend builds and deployments.


**Key Decisions / Dimensions**
 UI Design \\& Implementation Decisions
   

  

* Choosing appropriate UI patterns for conversational and single\\-task interfaces instead of traditional page\\-based navigation.
* Deciding when UI behavior should be driven by backend schemas versus handled locally in the frontend.
* Selecting animation and motion techniques that balance visual richness with performance constraints.
* Deciding fallback and degradation strategies for low\\-end devices, WebView limitations, and browser constraints. Framework \\& Component Decisions
* Defining reusable UI components and interaction patterns to be used across journeys.
* Choosing libraries or native implementations for animations, gestures, and multimodal interactions.
* Deciding how to structure components to keep them extensible and easy to maintain.
* Ensuring configuration\\-driven UI is preferred over hardcoded logic wherever possible. Performance, Security \\& Stability Decisions
* Deciding trade\\-offs between UI complexity and runtime performance.
* Implementing safe handling and rendering of user inputs, media, and AI responses.
* Deciding what data is rendered, masked, or excluded in the UI for compliance and audit needs.
* Testing UI changes across devices, OS versions, and integration environments before release.


**Major Challenges**
 Building a highly dynamic, conversational UI that replaces traditional screen\\-based navigation without confusing users.
   

  

* Delivering fluid, futuristic animations and rich visual effects while maintaining performance inside mobile WebViews and low\\-end devices.
* Handling multimodal inputs and outputs reliably across different devices, browsers, and mobile OS versions.
* Working within strict security, privacy, and compliance constraints while implementing advanced UI interactions.
* Adapting UI behavior based on user capabilities, channel limitations, and backend\\-driven schemas.
* Debugging and optimizing UI issues that span frontend code, WebView behavior, SDK integration, and backend responses.
* Maintaining clean, scalable frontend architecture as UI logic becomes increasingly dynamic and personalized.


**Required Qualifications And Experience**
 Educational Qualifications
   

  

* Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field.
* 3–4 years of hands\\-on frontend development experience. Technical Skills
* Strong proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Experience with modern frontend frameworks (Svelte, React, or equivalent).
* Experience building dynamic, single\\-page, component\\-based applications.
* Hands\\-on experience with animations, transitions, and motion systems.
* Experience handling multimodal inputs (text, voice, image, file).
* Familiarity with WebView constraints and cross\\-browser compatibility.
* Experience integrating with backend APIs (REST/gRPC). Performance, Security \\& Quality
* Knowledge of frontend performance optimization and bundle management.
* Awareness of frontend security practices and safe input handling.
* Experience integrating analytics, audit events, and logging.
* Exposure to CI/CD pipelines for frontend builds.","Financial Services","https://in.linkedin.com/company/bajaj-finserv-lending","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQGI7brquuayNg/company-logo_100_100/B4DZopVcERIAAQ-/0/1761630078812/bajaj_finserv_lending_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=LkTKfzERmLz4rNral55Q3ts5YP0emOPIxyk70rUiYyE","","","","","","","","","","",""
