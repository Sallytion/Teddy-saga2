 ● Debug complex production issues using logs, metrics, crash reports, and profiling tools
 



 ● Mentor junior engineers and contribute to engineering best practices

**What We’re Looking For (Must\\-Have)** 




  





 ● 4–6 years of professional software engineering experience
 



 ● Strong hands\\-on experience with Flutter and Dart in production
 



 ● Solid understanding of Flutter rendering pipeline, widget lifecycle, state management,
 



 and async programming
 



 ● Experience with at least one state management approach (Bloc, Riverpod, Provider,
 



 Redux, etc.) and knowing why you chose it
 



  





 ● Deep understanding of mobile fundamentals:
 



 ○ App lifecycle
 



 ○ Navigation and routing
 



 ○ Networking and error handling
 



 ○ Local storage (SQLite, Hive, SharedPreferences)
 



 ● Strong grasp of software engineering fundamentals:
 



  





 ○ Object\\-oriented design
 



 ○ SOLID principles
 



 ○ Separation of concerns
 



  





 ● Experience consuming REST / GraphQL APIs and handling real\\-world edge cases
 



 ● Strong debugging skills across Flutter, Android, and iOS layers
