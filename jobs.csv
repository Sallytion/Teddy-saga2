* Manage the practical realities of consumer apps: CI/CD pipelines, OTA releases, store compliance, and version rollouts.


**Engineering Ownership \\& Execution**
* Own features end\\-to\\-end: understand the user journey, clarify requirements, ship, and follow through until impact is achieved.
* Write clean, testable, and maintainable code with high standards for reliability.

* Experience with monitoring/analytics tools (Sentry, Crashlytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc. ).
* Exposure to real\\-time features (WebSockets, video/chat, live tracking).
* Experience with offline\\-first or low\\-connectivity user flows.


**Traits We Strongly Value**
* High ownership: you take problems from start to finish and care about what happens after launch.
* Execution \\& results driven: you prioritize shipping real value, not perfect theories.
* Time\\-respecting engineer: you don't over\\-engineeryour solutions are clean, practical, and scalable.
* User empathy: you think from the consumer's perspective and advocate for simplicity and delight.
