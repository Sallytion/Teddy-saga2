 These agents don’t just answer questions — they evaluate trade\\-offs, adapt to real\\-world constraints, and take action across investing, taxes, credit, savings, insurance, and more.This isn’t fintech\\-as\\-usual. It’s infrastructure for AI\\-native finance — modular, explainable, and composable from the ground up.
 



  





 We’re hiring engineers who love quantitative thinking, system design, and algorithmic precision — people who care as much about reasoning and outcomes as they do about clean code and fast iteration.
 



  





**What You’ll Do** 




 • Build autonomous agents that reason about money and act across domains
 



 • Design modular, testable Python logic for investing, portfolios, credit, insurance, planning
 



 • Orchestrate agent flows using LLMs, vector search, memory, retrieval, and planning tools
 



 • Simulate and evaluate agent performance under real\\-world scenarios and

 • Can write clean, expressive Python that drives logic, decisions, and interfaces
 



 • Have worked with (or want to learn) LangChain, vector DBs, LangGraph,
 



 HuggingFace, RAG pipelines
 



 • Thrive in high\\-ownership, low\\-hierarchy environments where outcome beats polish
 



 • Are excited to work on agents that simulate, plan, and execute — not just generate text
 



  





**Bonus Points If You’ve** 




 • Built agent\\-based systems or used orchestration tools (LangGraph, AutoGPT, Devin)
