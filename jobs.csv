* Hands\\-on experience with testing (pytest) and Git for version control.
* A track record of delivering scalable, maintainable code with a focus on ownership—leading projects from design to deployment.



  





**Our Approach to AI** 




**What We Do**

 **embed AI\\-driven capabilities into Fulfil’s ERP** 
 , powering natural language interfaces, intelligent automation, and merchant\\-facing insights
 
 (e.g., Fulfil x MCP integrations with Claude)
 
 .
* Focus on
 **applied AI for commerce operations** 
 — integrating models to solve real problems like order management, financial analysis, customer insights, and logistics optimization.



**What We Don’t** 



* We are
 **not** 
 a core ML/AI research company — we don’t train or fine\\-tune foundation models.
* We focus on
 **integration and productization of AI** 
 , not building new ML frameworks or developing custom model architectures.



  





**Bonus Points** 



* Experience scaling systems at a high\\-growth tech company.
* Familiarity with cloud platforms (Google Cloud, Heroku, etc.).
* Passion for optimizing distributed systems or e\\-commerce workflows.","Software Development, Technology, Information and Media, and IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/fulfil-io","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEVw3Af-RF7XA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1728512145831/fulfil_io_inc__logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Ac2Jszey3aLbksPb6kjt9KCAE6TZUJ2SztNLq9ZOtk4","","","","","","","","","","",""

* Ship Features Fast: Drive the rapid design, development, and deployment of new features, delivering value to high\\-growth merchants at breakneck speed.
* Integrate AI: Build and embed AI\\-driven capabilities into our ERP, enhancing automation and intelligence for order management, financials, and beyond.
* Master Scale and Stability: Optimize REST and GraphQL APIs (600\\+ endpoints), microservices, and Kubernetes/Docker deployments to handle millions of transactions with zero downtime.
* Elevate Code Quality: Refactor legacy systems, write testable code with pytest, and collaborate on peer reviews to keep our stack robust and maintainable.
* Bridge Ecosystems: Integrate seamlessly with e\\-commerce platforms (Shopify, Amazon) and logistics partners (FedEx, DHL), ensuring our merchants’ operations hum.
* Solve at Scale: Tackle the real\\-world challenges of a B2B SaaS leader—think complex business logic, reusable components, and global infrastructure management.

 , powering natural language interfaces, intelligent automation, and merchant\\-facing insights
 
 (e.g., Fulfil x MCP integrations with Claude)
 
 .
* Focus on
 **applied AI for commerce operations** 
 — integrating models to solve real problems like order management, financial analysis, customer insights, and logistics optimization.



**What We Don’t** 



* We are
 **not** 
 a core ML/AI research company — we don’t train or fine\\-tune foundation models.
* We focus on
 **integration and productization of AI** 
 , not building new ML frameworks or developing custom model architectures.



  





**Bonus Points** 



* Experience scaling systems at a high\\-growth tech company.
* Familiarity with cloud platforms (Google Cloud, Heroku, etc.).
* Passion for optimizing distributed systems or e\\-commerce workflows.","Software Development, Technology, Information and Media, and IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/fulfil-io","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEVw3Af-RF7XA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1728512145831/fulfil_io_inc__logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Ac2Jszey3aLbksPb6kjt9KCAE6TZUJ2SztNLq9ZOtk4","","","","","","","","","","",""
