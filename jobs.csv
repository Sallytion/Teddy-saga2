Today tax users spend too much time searching for accurate tax data across multiple applications, running \\& maintaining complex workflows and on manual manipulation before it can be used for tax and compliance activities. These data delays reduce valuable time which tax team can utilize for tax related activities like evaluating the returns, running the tax data simulation or drawing analytical insights for value\\-added decision making.
   

  

 Tax data storage is also a challenge for tax departments who often store tax data in multiple disparate spreadsheets and systems which increases the risk of errors. Equipped to handle large data sets, our platform helps provide greater connectivity so that users can spend less time on tax data manipulation and more time on tax data analytics.
