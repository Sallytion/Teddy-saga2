You'll help ensure that new features, performance improvements, and AI\\-driven extensions meet the highest standards of scalability and resilience.
   

  

**Why this role?**
 You'll work at the intersection of distributed systems engineering and test architecture \\-\\- hands on designing and building automation and frameworks that simulate complex multi\\-cloud deployments, chaos scenarios, and performance stress conditions.
   

  

 This is not QA\\-as\\-usual: you'll engineer the test systems that validate an elastic database platform capable of scaling thousands of non\\-uniform nodes, self\\-healing under failure, and integrating real\\-time vector search and analytics.
   

  

 If you thrive on deep technical challenges, curiosity, analytical and systems thinking, and building tools other engineers rely on, this role will feel like home.
   

  

**What You'll Help Doing**
* Design and develop frameworks for end\\-to\\-end and chaos testing of distributed, serverless Cassandra\\-based systems.
* Engineer automation that validates data correctness, fault tolerance, and performance under complex multi\\-region and multi\\-cloud topologies.
* Collaborate closely with feature development teams to model real\\-world scenarios and integrate automated validation into the delivery pipeline.
* Continuously evolve the test infrastructure for scale, speed, and observability \\-\\- leveraging Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud\\-native toolchains.
* Profile and tune distributed workloads to uncover systemic bottlenecks and verify that service\\-level goals are consistently met.
* Contribute code to shared testing frameworks and participate in design and code reviews across teams.
* Own the full cycle of quality engineering \\-\\- from test design and execution to insights and continuous improvement.


**Preferred Education**
 Master's Degree
   

  

**Required Technical And Professional Expertise**
* Exposure to system level Java and Python development in testing for distributed or cloud systems \\-\\- replication, partitioning, consistency, and eventual convergence.
* Familiarity with Linux, Kubernetes, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)
* Knowledge of analyzing complex logs and metrics to isolate performance and reliability issues.
* Eagerness to learn more about and using chaos testing, fault injection, or resilience validation.


**Preferred Technical And Professional Experience**
* Familiarity with NoSQL technologies (Cassandra, DynamoDB, ScyllaDB, etc.) and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and multi\\-cloud topologies.
* Understanding of vector search, AI embeddings, or data\\-intensive workloads.
* Curiosity\\-driven mindset, strong communication skills, and a focus on collaboration and craftsmanship.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/ibm","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGiz5ecgpCtkA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1688684715866/ibm_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=HPSmWLOCvdPkWO1nRWwjjmCNpaCqww20rSJ4E54QtxQ","","","","","","","","","","",""
