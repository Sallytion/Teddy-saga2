**About the Role:**
 You are a curious, motivated learner who is excited to work closely with our business teams and ensure our app is robust, scalable and has cutting edge features. You’re eager to learn, ask questions, and grow through hands\\-on exposure under guidance from senior engineers.
   

  

 You enjoy breaking down problems, experimenting with new tools, and understanding how real\\-world systems work. You’re comfortable taking feedback, iterating quickly, and contributing thoughtfully to a fast\\-paced engineering environment. This is paid Internship
   

  

**Responsibilities:**
 (All responsibilities will be performed under close guidance and review from senior engineers or tech leads.)
   

  

* Assist in designing and testing AI workflows (e.g., LangGraph\\-based flows) by helping document requirements, validate routing logic, and configure tools under supervision.
* Support the creation of small, reusable workflow components, such as basic nodes, validations, or structured outputs, following predefined patterns for retries and fallbacks.
* Help test and validate tool execution, ensuring outputs are safe, predictable, and meet defined acceptance criteria before use in downstream processes.
* Collaborate with Business Analysts and mentors to understand business goals and translate ideas into well\\-scoped, clearly defined tasks.
* Assist in maintaining internal agent\\-accessible services or APIs, including helping with data retrieval (e.g., Snowflake queries), configuration updates, and data enrichment tasks.
* Support evaluation and monitoring efforts for AI workflows by contributing to test cases, regression checks, and reviewing basic metrics such as latency, cost, and errors.
* Contribute to improvements in the transcription application by helping with data ingestion, basic data cleanup, validation, storage checks, and retrieval testing.
* Learn and apply reliability concepts (queues, workers, retries, idempotency) by assisting in testing and documenting how these mechanisms improve pipeline stability.
* Support rubric\\-based call scoring initiatives by helping validate outputs, review scoring logic, and ensure data is correctly published for coaching and operational use.
* Assist with exploratory work on streaming data, focusing on understanding data flow between capture, transcription, and scoring rather than owning implementation.
* Deliver small, clearly scoped tasks with regular check\\-ins, apply feedback quickly, and document learnings and outcomes.


**Requirements:**
* Super Eager to Learn (You're a Learner First!): You don't have to be a total guru yet, but you must be super curious and genuinely excited to learn and level up your skills. We're totally here to mentor you!
* Proactive \\& Driven (Be a Go\\-Getter): We love interns who just jump in, take the ball, and run with it. Don't wait around for constant hand\\-holding! We need forward\\-thinkers ready to tackle things on their own.
* Dedicated \\& Engaged (Be Present \\& All In): We need you to be available, focused, and ready to contribute your energy and time as a key player on our fast\\-paced, innovative team.
* Fast\\-Paced \\& Flexible (Quick on Your Feet): The tech world changes fast, and so do we. You need to be able to pick up new tools, tech, and ways of working, like, quickly.
* Coding Fundamentals (Got the Programming Chops): You should be comfortable with Python and/or TypeScript, especially with designing APIs/services. Solid SQL is a must, and you should be cool with warehouse\\-backed apps. Bonus points if you've played around with LLM applications, including:
* Getting tools/functions to work and making sure the outputs are structured and validated.
* Retrieval patterns (like RAG), routing, and keeping track of context.
* Prompt management, versioning, and figuring out how well they work (evaluation).
* AI Ecosystem Familiarity (You Know Your AI Stuff): Some exposure to tools like LangGraph, Botpress, or other agent builders is great (building agents and packaging up tools). Understanding streaming systems (WebSockets/HTTP2\\), including dealing with things like backpressure and reconnects, is also a plus. Basic audio knowledge (FFmpeg basics, codecs) and familiarity with transcription services would be super helpful.


**What you'll gain:**
* Internship Certificate: Upon successful completion of the internship, you will receive an official internship certificate from GoHighLevel, validating your contribution and learnings.
* Potential Full\\-Time Opportunity: Exceptional performers may be considered for a full\\-time role based on performance and business needs.
* Real\\-World Experience: Hands\\-on experience with software development projects, and collaboration with various teams.
* Mentorship \\& Development: Guidance from experienced colleagues \\& developers to accelerate your learning and professional growth.
* Career Growth: Become a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in application development with opportunities to take on increasing responsibility and ownership over time.

**Experience:** 
 0–2 Years (Freshers with a ""builder"" portfolio are highly encouraged!)
 



**Location:** 
 Remote
 



**Company:** 
 Vaaya.ai
 



  





 You don't want a standard graduate job moving Jira tickets. You want to build something real.
 



 At
 **Vaaya** 
 , we believe human intelligence is too valuable for repetitive work. We are building an AI\\-native product, and we need our internal operations to match that speed.
 



  





 We are looking for a
 **GTM \\& Automation Engineer \\-** 
 whether you have 2 years of experience or you just graduated and spent your nights building complex side projects. You see a manual sales process and immediately think:
 *""An AI agent should do that.""* 
 You will bridge the gap between Product and Growth, using tools like
 **n8n** 
 to build the autonomous ""internal engine"" that powers our sales motion.
   




**What You’ll Do (The Learning Curve)** 
* **Build the ""Internal Engine"":** 
 You won’t just be making simple Zapier triggers. You’ll learn to design and maintain resilient, multi\\-step workflows in
 **n8n** 
 that serve as the backbone of our Go\\-To\\-Market strategy.
* **Create AI Sales Agents:** 
 You’ll work with the founders to build autonomous agents that handle top\\-of\\-funnel tasks: combining data tools (like Clay), scoring leads based on AI intent signals, and drafting personalized outreach.
* **Master the APIs:** 
 You’ll become the resident expert on how our tools talk to each other. You will ensure our CRM (HubSpot) and data providers sync perfectly, ensuring zero data leakage.
* **Kill Manual Work:** 
 Your primary goal is simple: Identify bottlenecks in the founding team's sales process and automate them out of existence. If we are doing it manually twice, you automate it the third time.


**Who You Are** 
* **The Tinkerer's Mindset:** 
 You didn't wait for a job to start building. You have side projects, hackathon wins, or a portfolio of personal automations that prove you love this stuff.
 **Please share links to what you've built.**
* **Automation Obsessed (n8n focus):** 
 n8n is your playground. Even if you haven't used it professionally, you've played with it enough to understand webhooks, error handling, and data mapping. (Experience with Clay or Make is a bonus).
* **Unafraid of Code:** 
 You aren't a software engineer, but you don't panic when you see a ""Code Node."" You are willing to open ChatGPT and figure out the 5 lines of Javascript needed to format data correctly.
* **Hungry to Learn:** 
 You want to be on a founding team where you will learn more in 6 months than you would in 2 years at a big corporation. You absorb new tools quickly and hold yourself to a high standard.


**Why Vaaya?** 
* **Accelerated Growth:** 
 Work directly with second\\-time founders. You will see exactly how a company is built from zero to one.
* **High Autonomy:** 
 We don't micromanage. We give you a problem (e.g., ""Enrich these 500 leads"") and trust you to build the best automated solution.
* **AI\\-First Ops:** 
 We don't just build AI; we run on AI. You’ll have access to the latest models and tools to make our internal operations cutting\\-edge.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/vaayaai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHMdNEytbBTyw/company-logo_100_100/B56ZxOrBFRH0AU-/0/1770846425842/vaayaai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=FdZ4zESsjEpC7P-HRKizg92HpEPQHNCXC3Fr5yRW4Lo","","","","","","","","","","",""
