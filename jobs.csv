**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

**Senior Principal/Principal Design Verification Engineer** 




**We are seeking talented Design Verification Engineers with proven expertise in industry\\-standard protocols such as PCIe and CXL. You will play a key role in the functional verification of designs, from developing block\\-level and system\\-level verification plans to writing test sequences, executing tests, and collecting and closing coverage.** 








**Responsibilities** 



* **Develop and execute block\\-level and system\\-level verification plans.**
* **Write and execute test sequences and collect and close coverage.**
* **Collaborate with RTL designers to debug failures and refine verification processes.**
* **Utilize coding and protocol expertise to contribute to functional verification.**
* **Develop user\\-controlled random constraints in transaction\\-based verification methodologies.**
* **Write assertions, cover properties, and analyze coverage data.**
* **Create VIP abstraction layers for sequences to simplify and scale verification deployments.**



  





**Basic Qualifications** 



* **10\\-20 years’ experience in supporting or developing complex SoC/silicon products for server, storage, and/or networking applications.**
* **Strong academic and technical background in Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering (bachelor’s degree required, master’s preferred).**
* **Professional attitude with the ability to prioritize tasks, prepare for customer meetings, and work independently with minimal guidance.**
* **Knowledge of industry\\-standard simulators, revision control systems, and regression systems.**
* **Entrepreneurial, open\\-minded behavior and a can\\-do attitude, with a focus on customer satisfaction.**



  





**Required Experience** 



* **Interpreting PCIe/CXL standard protocol specifications to develop and execute verification plans in simulation environments.**
* **Experience using Verification IPs from third\\-party vendors for PCIe/CXL, focusing on Gen3 or above.**
* **Ability to independently develop test plans and sequences in UVM to generate stimuli.**
* **Experience writing assertions, cover properties, and analyzing coverage data.**
* **Developing VIP abstraction layers for sequences to simplify and scale verification deployments.**



  





**Preferred Experience** 



* **Expertise in verifying Physical Layer, Link Layer, and Transaction Layer of PCIe/CXL protocols, including compliance on PCIe/CXL EP/RC.**
* **Experience with buffering and queuing with QoS on complex NOC\\-based SoCs.**
* **Analyzing performance at the system level on switching fabrics.**
