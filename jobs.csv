Founded in 2018 by IITB alumni, our journey began with one bold mission: to eradicate the inefficiencies and confusion that have plagued the lending and collections industry for decades. We are backed by Y Combinator, Accel and Menlo Ventures.
   

  

 Today, we stand at the forefront of a seismic shift in the industry, building Agentic AI applications for consumer finance. Powered by our cutting\\-edge platform, Prodigal’s Intelligence Engine (PIE), we’re creating the next\\-generation agentic workforce \\- one that empowers companies to achieve unprecedented levels of operational excellence and intelligence.
   

  

 With over half a billion consumer finance interactions processed and a growing impact on more than 100 leading companies across North America, we’ve established ourselves as the go\\-to partner for organizations that demand more from their AI solutions. Our unparalleled experience, coupled with our trusted customer relationships, uniquely positions us to build Agentic AI applications that will revolutionize the future of consumer finance.
   

  

 At Prodigal, we are driven by a singular, unrelenting purpose: to transform how consumer finance companies engage with their customers and, in turn, drive successful outcomes for all.
   

  

 At Prodigal, we're building AI agents that autonomously handle complex workflows in consumer finance. But here's the thing: AI agents are only as powerful as their ability to actually do things—process payments, update CRM records, send communications, orchestrate multi\\-step financial operations. That's where you come in. We're looking for a Senior Integration Engineer who will build the critical infrastructure that allows our AI agents to seamlessly interact with payment systems, CRMs, communication platforms, and internal services. Your integrations won't just connect systems, they'll be the hands and eyes of autonomous agents making real\\-time decisions that affect real customers and real money. This is integration engineering at the frontier of AI: building systems that must be bulletproof because they're driven by agents operating independently at scale. Help us build the connective tissue that powers autonomous AI agents.
   

  

**What You'll Build**
* Design and build API integrations that serve as the execution engine for our AI agents—enabling them to process payments (Stripe, Razorpay), manage customer data (Salesforce, Zendesk), trigger communications, and orchestrate workflows across systems
* Navigate the complexity of third\\-party APIs, partner ecosystems, and sandbox environments to deliver integrations that work flawlessly under real\\-world conditions
* Create robust integration workflows with idempotency, intelligent retries, rate limiting, signature validation, and webhook processing that can handle the unpredictability and scale of autonomous agent behavior
* Build real\\-time feedback loops that allow AI agents to understand integration outcomes and adapt their decision\\-making dynamically
* Implement comprehensive observability: metrics, logs, distributed traces, and dashboards that give both engineers and AI systems complete visibility into integration health and performance
* Design monitoring and alerting that catches issues before they impact enterprise SLA commitments
* Own the full integration lifecycle—from architecture and coding through sandbox testing, deployment, and production support
* Partner directly with customer\\-facing teams and customers to understand integration requirements, translating business needs into technical solutions that unlock new agentic capabilities
* Troubleshoot production issues with urgency, performing root cause analysis and implementing systemic improvements that increase reliability


**What You Bring**
* Languages: Strong proficiency in Golang, TypeScript/Node.js, or Python
* Cloud Infrastructure: Deep AWS experience (Lambda, ECS, SQS/SNS, API Gateway, CloudWatch, DynamoDB/RDS, S3\\) with understanding of serverless and cloud\\-native patterns
* Data Systems: MongoDB and PostgreSQL expertise, including schema design for high\\-throughput integration workloads and query performance optimization
* Integration Mastery: Hands\\-on experience with REST APIs, OAuth flows, webhook systems, async workflows, message queues, event\\-driven architectures, and distributed transactions
* Security: Strong understanding of API security practices including HMAC signatures, token\\-based authentication, and ideally mutual TLS
* Proven ability to write clean, maintainable, well\\-tested code with strong attention to edge cases and failure modes
* Engineering Excellence: Debugging skills using logs, metrics, traces, and third\\-party diagnostic tools to quickly isolate and resolve complex integration issues
* Experience with CI/CD pipelines, version control, automated testing, and modern DevOps workflows
* Strong written and verbal communication—you can explain complex technical decisions to both engineering and business stakeholders


**Bonus Qualifications**
* Prior hands\\-on experience integrating with payment providers (Stripe, Adyen, Braintree, Razorpay) or CRM platforms (Salesforce, Zendesk, HubSpot)
* Experience in compliance\\-heavy domains like payments, fintech, or telecom
* Understanding of domain concepts like PCI constraints, ledgering, reconciliation, or financial workflows
* Familiarity with API tooling (Postman collections, API mocking, integration test frameworks)


**Why This Role Matters**
 Traditional integration engineering connects system A to system B. Agentic integration engineering means building infrastructure that autonomous AI can reliably operate—at scale, with real financial consequences, in regulated environments.
   

  

**Role**
 You'll work in a lean, high\\-ownership environment where your integrations directly unlock AI agent capabilities that transform how financial institutions operate. Every integration you build expands what our agents can autonomously accomplish. This role is perfect for engineers who:
   

  

* Are energized by working at the intersection of infrastructure and AI
* Love building systems that must be both elegant and bulletproof
* Thrive with high autonomy in fast\\-moving environments
* Want their code to directly enable transformative AI capabilities


 Join us in building the integration infrastructure that makes autonomous AI agents truly powerful in the real world.
   

  

**Job Benefits**
* GenAI experience – Work directly in the innovative field of GenAI, shaping groundbreaking projects that redefine consumer finance intelligence.
* World\\-class team \\- You'll get the chance to learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you'll ever meet. Our team members have been part of BCG, Deloitte, EY, Blackstone, Meta, Amazon and are IIT, IIM, BITS alumnus.
* Continuous education \\- As relentless seekers of knowledge, we sponsor and support any training materials, books, courses, and exam fees for upskilling yourself in areas related to your role \\- but that's not where it ends. If you make a good case for some extra learning, we're delighted to foot the tab.
* Food at the office – Meals are on us. We won't let your stomach grumble while you hustle.
* Health insurance \\- Health always comes first. The health of your family is as important to us, as it is to you. We offer insurance coverage for both you and your family.
* Flexible schedule \\- We're not a ""clock in, clock out"" company. Morning person? Start work while the world's still sleeping. Night owl? Ramp things up while others are winding down. You're fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you be available to your teammates for seamless collaboration.
* Generous leave policy \\- Take all the time you need to recharge your batteries \\- no cap on vacation here. Because a rested, relaxed, and refreshed mind is a happy and effective mind.
* Recreation \\& team activities – We regularly indulge in friendly football, table tennis, cooking sessions and challenge each other to do those extra push ups or chug that 4th drink (of course that’s Nimbu Pani).


 From day 1, Prodigal has been defined by talented, humble, and hungry leaders and we want this mindset and culture to continue to blossom from top to bottom in the company. If you have an entrepreneurial spirit and want to work in a fast\\-paced, intellectually\\-stimulating environment where you will be pushed to grow, then please reach out because we are looking to build a transformational company that reinvents one of the biggest industries in the US.
