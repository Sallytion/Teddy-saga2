**Role: Senior Founding Engineer** 




**Location: Chennai (On\\-site/Hybrid)** 




  





**Experience: 4\\+ Years** 




  





**The Mission** 




**Wault is building the world’s first independent safety \\& wellness ecosystem for women, blending deep\\-tech hardware with a consumer\\-first mobile experience.** 




**We are looking for a Founding Engineer to join the core leadership team. This is not a ""maintainer"" role; it is a ""builder"" role. You will be the Chief Architect of our digital ecosystem, holding the keys to our codebase and making high\\-stakes decisions on scalability, security, and AI infrastructure as we scale from 10k to 1M\\+ users. You are not just joining a company; you are partnering with the founders to build a category\\-defining brand.** 




**What You Will Build \\& Own** 



* **The ""Core"" Architecture: You will own the end\\-to\\-end architecture of the Wault App (React Native/Flutter) and our Backend (Node.js/Python). You decide how we structure our microservices, how we handle real\\-time websocket connections for SOS alerts, and how we secure sensitive user data.**
* **AI Delivery Pipeline (MLOps): You will bridge the gap between ""Code"" and ""Data Science."" You will build the infrastructure to deploy our proprietary AI models (Safety Readiness \\& Criticality Scores) into production. This involves setting up scalable inference APIs, managing model versioning, and potentially implementing ""Edge AI"" (running lightweight models directly on the user's phone for privacy).**
* **Real\\-Time SOS Infrastructure: You will build and maintain the critical alert systems that must function with 99\\.999% reliability. This involves optimizing GPS location streaming, audio packet transmission, and cloud\\-server latency.**
* **Hardware\\-Software Bridge: You will work directly with our Firmware team to define the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) communication protocols, ensuring seamless pairing, syncing, and over\\-the\\-air (OTA) updates between the Ring/Band and the App.**
* **DevOps \\& Security: You will set up and manage our CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), and ensure we meet global data privacy standards (GDPR/DPDP) from Day 1\\.**



  





**Who You Are** 



* **A System Thinker: You don't just solve the ticket; you ask ""How does this affect our database load 6 months from now?""**
* **Mobile \\& Backend Polyglot: You are equally comfortable optimizing React Native rendering performance and writing complex SQL queries or designing NoSQL schemas.**
* **AI\\-Ready Engineer: You may not be a Data Scientist, but you understand the basics of ML pipelines. You know how to wrap a Python model in a FastAPI container, handle inference latency, and integrate TFLite/CoreML into a mobile app.**
* **Owner Mindset: You treat the company’s money and code as your own. You enforce code quality, write clean documentation, and set the engineering culture for the team you will eventually hire and lead.**



  





**Good to Have** 




**• Experience with IoT, wearables, or device integrations** 




**• Exposure to real\\-time data processing or alerting systems** 




**• Experience in security, privacy, or regulated domains** 




**• Startup or zero\\-to\\-one product experience** 




  





**The Deal: Wealth Creation \\& Ownership** 




**This role comes with Founding Team Equity. We are structuring this to be a wealth\\-generating opportunity, not just a salary.** 



* **Vesting Schedule: Standard 4\\-year vesting with a 1\\-year cliff. This ensures that as we grow and raise future rounds (Series A/B), your stake grows in value alongside the founders'.**
* **True Ownership: You will have a seat at the table for product roadmap decisions, hiring strategies, and investor discussions.**



  





**Tech Stack** 



* **Mobile: React Native / Flutter**
* **Backend: Node.js / Python (Django/FastAPI)**
* **AI/ML Deployment: TensorFlow Lite, CoreML, Docker, Kubernetes**
* **Infrastructure: AWS/GCP, Firebase, BLE Integration, REST/GraphQL APIs**



  





**Why Join Wualt** 




**• You will build a category\\-defining product, not a feature** 




**• You will own real systems used in high\\-stakes situations** 




**• You will work directly with founders on product and technical  decisions** 




**• You will have meaningful equity and long\\-term upside** 




**• Your work will matter, visibly and measurably** 




  





**A Note on Stage and Reality** 




**Wualt is early\\-stage. Some assumptions will change. Some systems will evolve rapidly. Constraints will exist.**

**About Sitetracker**
 Sitetracker was founded ten years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
   

  

 However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full\\-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.
   

  

 We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the \\#2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people\\-first culture.
   

  

 We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.

**About Sitetracker**
 Sitetracker was founded ten years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
   

  

 However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full\\-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.
   

  

 We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the \\#2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people\\-first culture.
   

  

 We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.
