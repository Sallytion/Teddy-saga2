Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in systems design and testing, and have opportunities to present your work to your team and the wider org. Each intern has a dedicated intern manager, and every project is part of the team’s roadmap and will directly help Stripe’s mission.
   

  

 What you’ll do
   

  

 Every internship at Stripe centers around a real, legitimate project that our customers urgently need, touching many parts of our operations and stack. We will support you in shipping it. Yes, you will actually ship it. Some recent projects include rebuilding our statistics aggregation service, building new service discovery systems, and many user facing projects like making it easy to understand error messages on Stripe Checkout. As a Stripe intern, you'll be tackling important projects to increase global commerce, while working alongside exceptional people who insist on doing their best work.

 Who you are
   

  

 We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
   

  

**Minimum Requirements**
* A strong fundamental understanding of computer science through pursuit of a Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science, math, or a related discipline
* Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
* Experience from previous internships or other multi\\-person projects, including open source contributions, that demonstrate evaluating and receiving feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders
* Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts


**Preferred Qualifications**
* At least 2 years of university education, or equivalent work experience
* One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
* Understanding and some experience writing high quality pull requests, with good test coverage, and working knowledge to complete projects with minimal defects
* Familiarity with navigating and managing your work in new code bases, with multiple languages
* Ability to write clearly to explain your work to stakeholders, team members, and other Stripes


 In\\-office expectations
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in\\-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in\\-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.
