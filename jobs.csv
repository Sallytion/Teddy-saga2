 Prime Video is disrupting traditional media with an ever\\-increasing selection of movies, TV shows, Emmy Award winning original content, add\\-on subscriptions including HBO, and live events like Thursday Night Football. Our architecture operates at Amazon\\-scale and raises the bar for playback reliability, video start time, and image quality. Prime Video runs on thousands of device types in over 200 territories worldwide.
   

  

 The mission of the Content Localization \\& Accessibility team in Prime Video is to “Delight Prime Video customers world\\-wide with relevant language options and accessibility assists from Day 1”.
   

  

 With Prime Video’s 3Y goal to acquire and retain the next 100MM customers from international territories, it is imperative that our selection is made available to international customers in their preferred language. Generating such assets using Localization Service Providers (LSPs) takes multiple weeks to turn around and becomes cost prohibitive when scaled to our entire Catalog across the breadth of languages we support (32 UI languages). We obsess over making Prime Video the most inclusive streaming platform, providing content with accessibility assists like closed captions, audio description, and an industry\\-first Dialogue boost assist. With increased focus from regulatory bodies from several territories and mandating minimum bar for accessibility in terms of closed captions \\& audio descriptions coverage, the team is propelled to innovate for the customers in need. The Content Localization \\& Accessibility team drives this innovation by leveraging state of the art GenAI solutions to generate these multi\\-lingual and accessibility assets at scale, as well as building supply\\-chain automation, workflow management tooling and optimized human\\-in\\-the\\-loop solutions.
   

  

**Basic Qualifications**
* 5\\+ years of non\\-internship professional software development experience
* 5\\+ years of programming with at least one software programming language experience
* 5\\+ years of leading design or architecture (design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and existing systems experience
