 SPAN develops products that accelerate the rapid adoption of renewable energy in the home. The flagship SPAN Smart Panel is the first true evolution for the traditional home electric panel, harnessing enhanced technology for metering, monitoring, and control. An expanded product suite of intelligent, integrated solutions radically lowers the cost and complexity of energy upgrades–including solar, batteries and EVs–empowering homeowners to be active, resilient and informed players in the energy market.
   

  

**The Team and Role**
 SPAN’s Device Software team is responsible for all of the software that is physically embodied in our hardware products. Our first product \\- the SPAN Panel \\- contains a complex network of microcontrollers and a single board computer that must work together to react quickly to changing conditions with impeccable reliability in order to perform its job. We look for friendly, excellent engineers who enjoy working with their peers to solve complex problems and prioritize trusting that the people we hire are capable of great things when well supported. Engineers work directly with the broader software, product, and hardware teams to ensure the right things get built at the right time.
   

  

 As an engineer on the Device Software team you will define and implement new features directly related to SPAN’s hardware products focusing on the lowest level \\- the microcontroller. This includes everything from bootloaders on systems without an OS up through applications in C and C\\+\\+ inside an RTOS. Hardware products are central to SPAN’s business and writing firmware for even our smallest microcontrollers means working on something that directly impacts the user experience. You will own large user\\-facing features from conception through implementation on future hardware products, working independently to bring them to completion.
   

  

**Representative Projects**
* Designing an OTA system that encompasses a variety of communication interfaces, processor types, and products, while achieving both secure goals for hardware\\-backed encryption and verification and high reliability.
* Working with system architects to invent a data steaming architecture for a new product family which can satisfy both the needs of the data science team to access high rate and quality data, as well as safety guarantees around consistency and accuracy.
* Representing the Device Software team in group settings and evangelizing engineering best practices. Participating in code and design reviews as well as authoring documents which further reinforce these goals, and supporting engineers across the org in hitting them.
