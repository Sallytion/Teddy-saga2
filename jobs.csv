**Job Description**
*As a Senior Java Developer, you will design and implement robust backend services for our payment platform, focusing on
 **high performance** 
 and
 **security** 
 . You’ll be working with Java 17 and a wide range of modern frameworks and cloud technologies to build scalable microservices. This role requires an independent, skilled engineer who can write efficiently, secure code and optimize systems for throughput and low latency.*
**Key Responsibilities:**
* Develop high\\-performance \\& secure code:
   

 Write high\\-quality, efficient Java code to handle payment transactions at scale, following secure coding best practices (e.g. input validation, encryption). Ensure the application meets rigorous performance benchmarks and security standards (seasoned at writing secure and high\\-performance code).
* Microservices development:
   

 Design, build, and maintain microservices and RESTful APIs using Java 17 (with frameworks like Spring Boot) to create modular, scalable backend architecture. Implement resilience patterns (circuit breakers, timeouts) and distributed tracing for reliability.
* Concurrency and optimization:
   

 Solve complex concurrency and scalability challenges by writing multi\\-threaded, asynchronous code (e.g. using modern Java features like CompletableFutures and ExecutorService). Profile and tune the JVM for low latency and high throughput to optimize performance under heavy load.
* Data and caching layer:
   

 Integrate with both NoSQL databases (MongoDB, DynamoDB) and caching systems (Redis) to store and retrieve data efficiently. Optimize database queries and caching strategies for maximum throughput and minimal latency.
* Event\\-driven architecture:
   

 Implement event\\-driven and message\\-based features using Apache Kafka (or AWS Managed Kafka) for inter\\-service communication. Ensure the system can process and route events reliably to support real\\-time payment processing.
* Cloud deployment \\& DevOps:
   

 Deploy and containerize applications on AWS and Kubernetes/OpenShift. Collaborate with DevOps engineers to use AWS services (EC2, ECS/EKS, Lambda, etc.) for scalable deployment, and to streamline CI/CD pipelines (using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions) for frequent, reliable releases.
* Monitoring \\& observability:
   

 Implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting (e.g. integrate with ELK/Elasticsearch, Prometheus/Grafana) to ensure observability of microservices in production. Quickly troubleshoot performance bottlenecks or errors using these tools.
* Quality assurance:
   

 Write thorough unit, integration, and performance tests to verify that code meets functional and performance requirements. Participate in peer code reviews to uphold code quality and security standards and fix bugs or vulnerabilities promptly.


**Qualifications**
**Required Skills and Experience:**
* Experience:
   

 5–10 years of hands\\-on Java development experience (4\\+ years minimum), with a track record of building highly available, high\\-performance, scalable applications. Prior experience in fintech or payment systems is a plus (familiarity with financial protocols or compliance standards beneficial).
* Java \\& Frameworks:
   

 Expertise in Java (Java 11 or above, ideally Java 17\\) and the Spring ecosystem (Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Cloud, Spring Security). Strong understanding of object\\-oriented design, design patterns, and API development.
* Microservices \\& Messaging:
   

 Strong grasp of microservices architecture and distributed system principles (e.g. service discovery, load balancing, fault tolerance). Experience building RESTful APIs and working with messaging systems like Kafka for event\\-driven architecture.
* Databases:
   

 Experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases. Proficiency in MongoDB (or other document stores) and DynamoDB; ability to design efficient schemas and optimize queries. Familiarity with Redis for caching and fast data access.
* Cloud \\& DevOps:
   

 Solid knowledge of AWS cloud services (EC2, ECS/EKS, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, etc.) and container orchestration using Kubernetes/OpenShift. Ability to work with CI/CD pipelines and tools for automated testing and deployment.
* Security:
   

 Strong understanding of secure coding practices – adept at writing code that defends against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10\\). Experience with encryption and key management (AWS KMS) and handling secrets via HashiCorp Vault for protecting sensitive data. Familiarity with authentication/authorization mechanisms (OAuth2/OIDC, JWT) and integration with IDAM solutions like Keycloak is highly desirable.
* Performance Tuning:
   

 Proven ability to optimize application performance (memory management, JVM tuning, profiling) and to conduct load testing or use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks. Experience in building multi\\-threaded applications and using asynchronous patterns to improve throughput.
* Soft Skills:
   

 Excellent problem\\-solving skills and attention to detail, especially under the demands of building a financial\\-grade system. Self\\-motivated and able to work independently in a remote team.
