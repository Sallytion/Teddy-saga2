 📍 Chennai or
 **Remote (India preferred)** 
 \\| Full\\-time
 



 💼 Base \\+
 **Uncapped Commission** 
 \\| Reports directly to
 **Samy** 
 (CTO, Layerpath)
 



  





**⚠️ Before You Apply: 3 Non\\-Negotiables** 




  





 We’ve learned the hard way what works in early hires. Please read before applying:
 



  





 This role is not for you if:
 



  




1. You want a cushy “AI Research” title without shipping product.
2. You’re afraid to work across the stack (frontend \\+ backend \\+ AI infra).
3. You expect detailed JIRA tickets instead of shaping the roadmap yourself.



  





**This role is for you if:** 




  




* You’re excited to build zero\\-to\\-one: scrappy, fast, and user\\-obsessed.
* You’ve hacked on AI for fun (show us a weekend project, not just a paper).
* You want to own core pieces of product, not just tasks.



  





**About the Role** 




 We’re Layerpath, an a16z\\-backed startup building the AI Demo Agent—an always\\-on marketing and sales agent that shows, tells, and qualifies buyers 24/7\\.
 



  





 We need a kick\\-ass engineer who loves both AI and product to help us ship fast.
 



  





 You’ll work on Path AI, our conversational demo agent: voice \\+ text \\+ visuals \\+ actions. That means taking real\\-time audio, LLM reasoning, product knowledge, and making it work in a live buyer interaction.
 



  





**What You’ll Actually Do** 




  




* **Architect \\& scale voice infra** 
 → build on LiveKit/Pipecat to handle real\\-time conversations.
* **Ship STT/TTS pipelines** 
 → low latency, high quality, no excuses.
* **Build intelligent AI flows** 
 → RAG \\+ workflows so the agent feels smart, not scripted.
* **Engineer end\\-to\\-end** 
 → Next.js frontend, Python/Supabase backend, AI integrations.
* **Evaluate \\& iterate** 
 → ship, test, break, and improve daily with users in the loop.



  





**Minimum Qualifications** 




  




* You’ve built something real with AI (side project, hackathon, repo: we want to see it).
* Strong with
 **Next.js, Python, Supabase** 
 .
* Comfortable wiring LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) into production apps.
* Bonus: experience with
 **real\\-time audio (LiveKit, Pipecat, Twilio)** 
 .
* Clear communicator who thrives in small, high\\-trust teams.



  





**Why This Role Matters** 




 Every line of code you write and every feature you ship becomes the foundation of Path AI.
 



 You’re not just an engineer, you’re shaping the
 *category\\-defining product* 
 for AI\\-native GTM.
 



  





**What You’ll Get:** 




  




* Competitive base \\+ equity (founding team level).
* Direct access to founder, CTO, and design lead.
* Opportunity to ship core features of an AI agent seen by 1000\\+ buyers in weeks.
* A front\\-row seat to building one of the first real “agentic companies.”



  





**About Layerpath** 




  





 Layerpath is redefining how B2B products are demoed and sold.
 



  





 We’re building the
 **Demonstration Layer for the internet** 
 \\- replacing static websites and canned calls with AI demo agents that qualify, explain, and convert buyers.
 



  





 Backed by
 **a16z Speedrun, Jason Calacanis, and top Silicon Valley angels** 
 , we’ve already attracted 10k\\+ signups and dozens of paying customers.
 



  





**Our Culture \\+ What We Look For** 




  





 We move fast, test everything, and ship in public.
 



  





 We don’t do bureaucracy. We don’t do “wait and see.”
 



 We do high\\-agency execution where speed, clarity, and ownership win.
 



  





**The people who thrive here:** 




  




* Think like founders, not employees
* Care about the
 *why* 
 behind what they’re building.
* Love shaping process, not just following one
* Are excited to look back and say:
 *“I was there when it all started.”*



  





 If you’re curious, scrappy, and want to build something real, apply. Show us what you’ve hacked on, GitHub, demo, repo, anything.
