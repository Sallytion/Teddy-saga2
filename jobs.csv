**About Sitetracker**
 Sitetracker was founded ten years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
   

  

 However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full\\-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.
   

  

 We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the \\#2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people\\-first culture.
   

  

 We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.

 Not a role where you just optimize endpoints or manage tickets. You’ll be helping architect the backend of a global, privacy\\-first communication platform— built from the ground up, on principles we don’t compromise. It’s an opportunity to craft a product that users love—and one that holds its own against WhatsApp, Teams, or Signal, not just in UX, but in security, auditability, and data control. You’ll build systems that deliver consumer\\-grade performance and military\\-grade privacy. We’re not iterating on someone else’s blueprint. We’re carving a new one.
 



  





**Who are we?** 




  





 We are a young product company scaling fast and outgrowing the startup tag—with global scale in our crosshairs. We don’t do “okay.” We give everything we’ve got to build the best communication platform in the world. Our team includes engineers from IIT and other top institutions—people who care deeply about the craft, performance, and purpose. You’ll learn more in 6 months here than most engineers do in 3 years elsewhere. We’re intense. High\\-strung. Focused. Our team includes engineers from IIT and other top\\-tier
 



 backgrounds. But what defines us is not our degrees—it’s our refusal to compromise on quality, performance, or privacy.
 



  





**What are we building?** 




  





 WrkTalk is the world's first zero\\-access, zero\\-spam enterprise communication product that operates on a structural privacy architecture. One that’s already earned the trust of large enterprises like L\\&T Finance, Adani Group, and Kalyan Jewellers – just to name a few of our enterprise clients. This is not an MVP. This is production\\-grade software that secures communication for thousands—and soon, millions—of professionals worldwide.
 



  





**What’s the role?** 




  





 • Design and build blazing\\-fast, secure APIs using NestJS and Golang
 



 • Architect robust microservices that scale and perform under pressure
 



 • Engineer real\\-time communication using WebSockets, WebRTC, and mediasoup
 



 • Optimize and tune PostgreSQL and Redis for lightning\\-fast access and reliability
 



 • Lead Dockerized deployments and manage Kubernetes clusters
 



 • Collaborate with our high\\-performance team of frontend devs, DevOps, and product leaders to ship elite\\-quality code
 



 • Build for zero\\-trust environments—because no data should ever leak
 



  





**The tech here is serious.** 




 We work on socket\\-driven comms infrastructure, distributed control towers, multi\\-category encryption, root detection, app kill\\-switches, dynamic guest access, device\\-level lockout, and OOO/ DND logic layered with smart whitelisting. This is not lightweight app dev. This is protocol\\-layer decision\\-making.
 



  





**Why should you join?** 




  





 • Because you want to own backend architecture—not just follow it
 



 • Because you’ll work directly with established founders, not buried under layers
 



 • Because you’ll ship real, deeply engineered features used by large number of enterprise users
 



 • Because you’ll grow 10x faster here—in experience, learning, and impact
 



 • And because if you walk this road with us for 3–4 years, it’ll catapult you into a tech orbit or fame and glory you never imagined
 



  





**Who should apply?** 




  





 • 5\\+ years of backend experience building high\\-performance systems
 



 • Expertise in Golang and Node.js (NestJS)
 



 • Deep knowledge of PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes
 



 • Strong command over microservices, RESTful APIs, and authentication protocols
 



 • Prior experience with real\\-time systems (WebSockets, WebRTC, mediasoup is a big plus)
 



 • Builders. Owners. With hunger to ship fast, fail fast, and optimize endlessly
 



  





**Where are we located?** 




 We’re based in Navi Mumbai and building for the world.","Data Security Software Products, Technology, Information and Media, and IT Services and IT Consulting","https://in.linkedin.com/company/wrktalk-io","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQHheVmzqMa86g/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1714278260972/wrktalk_io_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Jz70zOzUYtL3N4Fs1_6flgtf7zybajP0pudXeQiK8Ro","","","","","","","","","","",""

**A US\\-based, venture\\-funded company transforming eCommerce visuals with AI\\-powered bulk photo editing is Looking for:**
 What You’ll Do
   

  

* Build and own AI\\-backed features end to end, from ideation to production — including layout logic, smart cropping, visual enhancement, out\\-painting and GenAI workflows for background fills
* Design scalable APIs that wrap vision models like BiRefNet, YOLOv8, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, ControlNet, etc., into batch and real\\-time pipelines.
* Write production\\-grade Python code to manipulate and transform image data using NumPy, OpenCV (cv2\\), PIL, and PyTorch.
* Handle pixel\\-level transformations — from custom masks and color space conversions to geometric warps and contour ops — with speed and precision.
* Integrate your models into our production web app (AWS based Python/Java backend) and optimize them for latency, memory, and throughput
* Frame problems when specs are vague — you’ll help define what “good” looks like, and then build it
* Collaborate with product, UX, and other engineers without relying on formal handoffs — you own your domain****
 What You’ll Need
   

  

* 2–3 years of hands\\-on experience with vision and image generation models such as YOLO, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, Stable Diffusion, VITON, or TryOnGAN — including experience with inpainting and outpainting workflows using Stable Diffusion pipelines (e.g., Diffusers, InvokeAI, or custom\\-built solutions)
* Strong hands\\-on knowledge of NumPy, OpenCV, PIL, PyTorch, and image visualization/debugging techniques.
* 1–2 years of experience working with popular LLM APIs such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and how to compose multi\\-modal pipelines
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
* Experience solving real\\-world visual problems like object detection, segmentation, composition, or enhancement.
* Ability to debug and diagnose visual output errors — e.g., weird segmentation artifacts, off\\-center crops, broken masks.
* Deep understanding of image processing in Python: array slicing, color formats, augmentation, geometric transforms, contour detection, etc.
* Experience building and deploying FastAPI services and containerizing them with Docker for AWS\\-based infra (ECS, EC2/GPU, Lambda).
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
* A customer\\-centric approach — you think about how your work affects end users and product experience, not just model performance
* A quest for high\\-quality deliverables — you write clean, tested code and debug edge cases until they’re truly fixed
* The ability to frame problems from scratch and work without strict handoffs — you build from a goal, not a ticket


 Who You Are
   

  

* You’ve built systems — not just prototypes
* You care about both ML results and the system’s behavior in production
* You’re comfortable taking a rough business goal and shaping the technical path to get there
* You’re energized by product\\-focused AI work — things that users feel and rely on
* You’ve worked in or want to work in a startup\\-grade environment: messy, fast, and impactful


 What You Get
   

  

* Full autonomy over your problem space
* A builder\\-first, no\\-handoff culture

 What You’ll Do
   

  

* Build and own AI\\-backed features end to end, from ideation to production — including layout logic, smart cropping, visual enhancement, out\\-painting and GenAI workflows for background fills
* Design scalable APIs that wrap vision models like BiRefNet, YOLOv8, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, ControlNet, etc., into batch and real\\-time pipelines.
* Write production\\-grade Python code to manipulate and transform image data using NumPy, OpenCV (cv2\\), PIL, and PyTorch.
* Handle pixel\\-level transformations — from custom masks and color space conversions to geometric warps and contour ops — with speed and precision.
* Integrate your models into our production web app (AWS based Python/Java backend) and optimize them for latency, memory, and throughput
* Frame problems when specs are vague — you’ll help define what “good” looks like, and then build it
* Collaborate with product, UX, and other engineers without relying on formal handoffs — you own your domain****
 What You’ll Need
   

  

* 2–3 years of hands\\-on experience with vision and image generation models such as YOLO, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, Stable Diffusion, VITON, or TryOnGAN — including experience with inpainting and outpainting workflows using Stable Diffusion pipelines (e.g., Diffusers, InvokeAI, or custom\\-built solutions)
* Strong hands\\-on knowledge of NumPy, OpenCV, PIL, PyTorch, and image visualization/debugging techniques.
* 1–2 years of experience working with popular LLM APIs such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and how to compose multi\\-modal pipelines
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
* Experience solving real\\-world visual problems like object detection, segmentation, composition, or enhancement.
* Ability to debug and diagnose visual output errors — e.g., weird segmentation artifacts, off\\-center crops, broken masks.
* Deep understanding of image processing in Python: array slicing, color formats, augmentation, geometric transforms, contour detection, etc.
* Experience building and deploying FastAPI services and containerizing them with Docker for AWS\\-based infra (ECS, EC2/GPU, Lambda).
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
* A customer\\-centric approach — you think about how your work affects end users and product experience, not just model performance
* A quest for high\\-quality deliverables — you write clean, tested code and debug edge cases until they’re truly fixed
* The ability to frame problems from scratch and work without strict handoffs — you build from a goal, not a ticket


 Who You Are
   

  

* You’ve built systems — not just prototypes
* You care about both ML results and the system’s behavior in production
* You’re comfortable taking a rough business goal and shaping the technical path to get there
* You’re energized by product\\-focused AI work — things that users feel and rely on
* You’ve worked in or want to work in a startup\\-grade environment: messy, fast, and impactful


 What You Get
   

  

* Full autonomy over your problem space
* A builder\\-first, no\\-handoff culture
* Remote\\-first flexibility (India preferred)
* Base \\+ Variable \\+ meaningful equity
* A product shipping to some of the world’s most recognizable brands
