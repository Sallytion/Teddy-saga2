 Could that be you?
   

  

 Your mission
   

  

 The Documentation Portal (docs.uipath.com) is a public‑facing knowledge hub that hosts every product guide, installation manual, API reference, release note, and tutorial across the UiPath platform—covering multiple versions, deployment types, and languages. The portal is undergoing a full overhaul. Internally, we must modernize our content management system and adopt a DocOps approach to raise documentation quality and keep pace with rapid product growth. Externally, we will revamp content delivery to support in‑place sample runs and optimize the experience for a range of coding paradigms and editors.
   

  

 What you'll do at UiPath
   

  

 We are looking for talented and driven Software Engineer 1 who excel in creating exceptional user experiences and take pride in delivering highly scalable and maintainable solutions.

 Bias for Action \\& Adaptability: Exhibit a proactive, can\\-do attitude with an entrepreneurial mindset. Comfortable navigating dynamic environments and embracing ambiguity when solving complex business problems.
   

  

 Effective Communication Skills: Clearly articulate technical ideas, design decisions, and solutions to diverse audiences in both written and verbal formats while driving consensus.
   

  

 What you'll bring to the team
   

  

 1–2 years of hands\\-on experience as a software developer (internships and project work count).
   

  

 Strong programming skills in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, or similar.
   

  

 Experience using AI models or APIs to build real software — not just academic or research exposure.
   

  

 Comfortable working with APIs, backend services, and cloud infrastructure.
   

  

 A builder’s mindset: you like creating usable things, fast.
   

  

 Curiosity about how AI is reshaping software development and user experiences.
   

  

 Maybe you don’t tick all the boxes above—but still think you’d be great for the job? Go ahead, apply anyway. Please. Because we know that experience comes in all shapes and sizes—and passion can’t be learned.

 We understand that software is living and needs investment. The challenge is making the right trade\\-offs, communicating those decisions effectively, and crisp execution.
   

  

 We need engineers who can build services that handle millions of requests per second. We need engineers who can figure out how we can survive regional data centre outages and protect our customers. We need engineers who can build services that enable us to offer even more options to customers and contribute to the overall growth of Oracle Cloud.
