**Job Description**
 Mid\\-level Generative AI Application Developer:
   

  

 We are looking for an experienced Generative AI Application Developer to join our team and lead the design and implementation of AI\\-powered internal applications such as chatbots, copilots, and workflow automations. You will be responsible for building, integrating, and evolving generative AI applications that connect to Experian's internal systems and APIs, using modern Python frameworks and large language models. You will work with engineers, product, and partners to deliver, secure and scalable AI solutions that create value across the organisation.
   

  

 What you'll need to bring to the role \\& Experian
   

  

* A Bachelor's degree in computer science, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).
* 3–5 years of experience in software development, with at least 1–2 years hands\\-on building generative AI or ML\\-create applications.
* Programming skills in Python, including writing clean, modular, testable code; use virtual environments, dependency management, and packaging; debugging, logging, and error\\-handling in production services.
* Deep familiarity with generative AI concepts, such as LLMs, prompting, embeddings, tokens, model selection, safety/guardrails, and evaluation.
* I have over 1 year of experience with Python\\-based generative AI frameworks, such as LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, or similar orchestration frameworks. I can choose and structure frameworks appropriately, rather than using them as black boxes.
* Working knowledge of Model Context Protocol (MCP), tools/plugins, or equivalent connector patterns, and how agents securely call external systems.
* An understanding of how applications and APIs work end\\-to\\-end is important. This includes designing and consuming REST/HTTP APIs, which involves authentication, pagination, rate limiting, and error handling. Additionally, it involves building backend services or microservices, such as those using FastAPI, Flask, or similar technologies.
* Hands\\-on experience with databases and data access (ex: relational databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and ORMs/Query builders) and basic schema design and query optimisation for application workloads.
* Practical exposure to cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure), especially for hosting APIs and services, using managed databases, queues, and storage. Basic security, networking, and secrets management concepts.
* Experience working in Agile teams (Scrum/Kanban), using Git and CI/CD pipelines; comfortable participating in code reviews and improving engineering practices.
* Ability to mentor junior developers, give constructive feedback, and champion good coding standards and design practices.


 Work that matters \\- What you'll do
   

  

* Develop internal generative AI applications (chatbots, copilots and automations) that integrate with Experian systems and workflows.
* Develop and operate Python\\-based backends and APIs that connect LLMs to internal data sources, tools and business logic.
* Use frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI Agents / Assistants SDK to orchestrate prompts, tools, and agents.
* Shape and evolve RAG architectures, including document ingestion, embeddings/vector stores and retrieval flows, to improve relevance and quality.
* Implement guardrails, safety controls and fallbacks to ensure secure, reliable and compliant AI behaviour in production.
* Contribute to standards, documentation and mentoring, helping junior developers and the wider team adopt good practices in generative AI development.
* Participate in testing and evaluating AI applications to ensure they are, in consideration of our requirements, and safe to use (including checking prompts, guardrails, and failure modes).
* Collaborate with product and partners to understand use cases, define solutions, estimate effort and iterate based on feedback and metrics.


 More about you
   

  

* With a willingness to prototype by doing.
* Curiosity about how things work end\\-to\\-end: from the UI, through backend APIs, to the underlying models and data.
* Experience communicating updates and resolutions to customers and other partners and the ability to work collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team environment.
* Comfortable explaining technical concepts in simple terms to non\\-technical stakeholders.
* Team\\-oriented mindset, working closely with business users, analysts, developers, and other stakeholders.
* Experience reviewing code to find and address potential issues and defects, especially when testing and validating AI behaviour.
* Experience weighing specific technical tradeoffs to maximize impact for effort when designing prompts, tools, and user flows.
* Ethically aware of bias, hallucinations, privacy, and misinformation risks when designing and deploying AI solutions.


 Why this role is important to us
   

  

 This role is critical to how we adopt and scale Generative AI across the organization. You won't just be experimenting with new technology – you'll be shipping real AI products that colleagues rely on to work more efficiently and make better decisions. You are expected to own solutions end\\-to\\-end: from shaping internal use cases, to building robust RAG/LLM\\-powered services, and improving them over time. Your technical choices will influence our standards for AI architecture, safety, and quality. You'll also play a key part in uplifting the team, by sharing best practices, mentoring junior developers, and helping define how we build and operate AI systems at Experian. Over time, this role is a natural steppingstone towards senior technical leadership in AI application development, with a strong impact on how we responsibly use Generative AI on a scale.
   

  

**Qualifications**
* A Bachelor's degree in computer science, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).
* 3–5 years of experience in software development, with at least 1–2 years hands\\-on building generative AI or ML\\-create applications.

 As a Software Development Engineer 2 you are in a mid\\-level Individual Contributor role at Tesco. Engineers at SDE2 level will continue their career development and show potential for an SDE3 role. SDE2 is a stepping stone towards SDE3, rather than a career destination in its own right. At this level, your impact reaches across a team, and you provide technical leadership of medium to large features. You are starting to produce your own work by understanding the problems that the team faces and are beginning to support other engineers with their own delivery and development. You prioritise sharing your skills and knowledge. You also prioritise quality of work, helping your team to continually set the standard. You understand and apply best practice within Tesco and across the industry.

I am likely to be considered an expert in a specific part of my domain.

I work within my team, utilising data driven decision making techniques, to encouraging optimal outcomes whilst accepting appropriate trade\\-offs. I am comfortable both supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on major components or small services as appropriate. At this level I display a degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team and am experienced enough to know when I need support. I am able to identify risks and raise these as appropriate. At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team. I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code. I have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing these within my team. I am comfortable working in a group context and am capable of communicating technical concepts to key stakeholders.

**Location:** 
 Chennai, India
   

**Reports to:** 
 Head of Integrations
   

**Role Type:** 
 Hands\\-on senior individual contributor with support leadership responsibilities
 


**Company \\& Core Product Snapshot** 

 Touchstream is the
 **OTT Operations Hub** 
 : a cloud\\-native SaaS platform for independent, end\\-to\\-end monitoring of streaming video systems (CDNs, origin, delivery chain). We serve some of the world’s largest broadcasters, telco/OTT services, and streaming platforms—monitoring tens of thousands of live streams in real time.
 



 Touchstream now unifies its best selling
 **CDN Monitoring** 
 and
 **VirtualNOC**

1. ****Reliability ownership:****
 ensure high availability, performance, and change safety across the system (UI/API and ingest, process \\& query pipelines), with strong SLO discipline and continuous improvement.
2. ****Support leadership:****
 run and evolve the support operation—triage, escalation, incident response coordination, tooling, and (over time) building a strong support team in Chennai to deliver world\\-class customer outcomes.



 This is a highly impactful role at the intersection of
 **SRE, incident management, observability engineering, and customer\\-facing support**

* Lead high\\-severity incidents end\\-to\\-end: triage, mitigation, rollback, “stop the bleeding” decisions, stakeholder comms.
* Track MTTA/MTTR and implement systemic improvements over time.


**3\\) Observability for the Observability Platform (“Meta\\-Observability”)** 
* Own “
 *who watches the watcher?* 
 ”—monitoring and alerting for Touchstream’s monitoring pipeline itself.
* Standardize telemetry conventions (logs/metrics/traces) across services.
* Build and maintain dashboards for:
+ ingest health (per customer / per source)
+ pipeline lag
+ query performance
+ alerting health

* Tune alerting to reduce noise: dedupe, routing, “symptom vs cause,” threshold hygiene.


**4\\) Release Engineering \\& Change Safety (Bulletproof Change Management)** 
* Implement guardrails: feature flags, progressive delivery/canaries, automated rollback triggers.
* Maintain release readiness practices: migration checks, backfills, customer impact assessment, capacity impacts.
* Drive change metrics: deploy frequency, change failure rate, recovery time from deploys.


**5\\) Cost \\& Efficiency Ownership (Cloud Economics)** 
* Monitor and optimize cost per GB ingested/stored/queried.
* Enforce retention policies, tiering, sampling, and query limits without breaking customer value.
* Make explicit capacity vs. cost tradeoffs—especially around large live events and heavy dashboards.


**6\\) Security \\& Resilience Basics (Small\\-Team Practicality)** 
* Baseline controls: access reviews, secrets management, least privilege, dependency scanning.
* Rate limiting / abuse guardrails, audit logging, security incident response readiness.
* Backup/restore and lightweight\\-but\\-real disaster recovery drills.


**7\\) Support Leadership \\& Operations (Explicitly Part of the Role)**

 Senior Technical Support Manage…
* Partner with Engineering/Product/Integrations to turn support learnings into reliability fixes and product improvements.
* Over time: help build, mentor, and lead a team of support/NOC engineers in Chennai.


**8\\) Customer\\-Impact Focus (Tenant Health \\& Trust)** 
* Maintain per\\-tenant “customer health views”: SLO compliance, noisy sources, top offenders, recurring incident patterns.
* Collaborate with Product on operator workflows: service health panels, incident summaries, status updates.


**Required Qualifications \\& Skills** 
**Technical / SRE Foundation** 
* 8\\+ years in SRE, production operations, technical support for SaaS, or NOC/ops roles with strong reliability ownership.
* Strong Linux fundamentals; comfort with debugging distributed systems.

* Ability to automate operational work (Python and/or shell scripting); comfort with APIs and CLI tooling.


**Streaming / OTT Domain (Nice to Have)** 
* Strong understanding of video streaming and delivery concepts: HLS, DASH, CMAF, ABR, CDNs, origin, HTTP, caching, DNS, SSL/TLS.  Familiarity with AWS Media Services is a big plus.


**Support Leadership \\& Customer Communication** 
* Proven ability to run escalations and communicate clearly in high\\-pressure incidents.
* Experience designing support workflows, SLAs, escalation paths, and operational KPIs.
* Strong written and verbal English; confidence presenting incident status and RCAs to customers.


**Working Style**
