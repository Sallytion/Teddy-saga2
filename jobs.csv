**Type:** 
 Full\\-time 
 




  





**Role Overview** 




 We’re looking for a hands\\-on QA Engineer to own product quality for a production software application used in real\\-world operational environments. Bugs directly disrupt customer workflows, so quality is critical.
 



 This role combines manual testing, end\\-to\\-end validation, and foundational frontend test automation, with selective use of AI\\-assisted testing tools. Backend testing is largely covered; the focus is on strengthening frontend (web and mobile) testing.
 



  





**What You'll Do** 




  





 \\*  Perform manual and exploratory testing across the application.
 



 \\*  Execute end\\-to\\-end testing of key user workflows.
 



 \\*  Test tickets once they're ready for QA and validate fixes before release.
 



 \\*  Help establish frontend testing coverage where little currently exists.
 



 \\*  Use automation where it improves efficiency (not automation\\-only).
 



 \\*  Work with AI\\-assisted tools to generate and guide frontend tests.
 



 \\*  Create and apply acceptance criteria for features and fixes.
 



 \\*  Log and track bugs clearly in GitHub.
 



 \\*  Work closely with product and engineering in stand\\-ups and release cycles.
 



  





**What We're Looking For** 




  





 \\*  Experience in manual QA testing for production software.
 



 \\*  Working knowledge of test automation.
 



 \\*  Experience testing frontend applications (web; mobile exposure preferred).
 



 \\*  Strong understanding of real\\-world user workflows and failure points.
 



 \\*  Comfortable balancing manual testing and automation in one role.
 



 \\*  Detail\\-oriented, ownership\\-driven, and able to work independently in a small team.
 



  





**Tools \\& Environment** 




 \\*  GitHub for tickets and bug tracking.
 



 \\*  AI\\-assisted testing tools used with human guidance.
 



 \\*  Lean engineering team, aggressive timelines, production\\-focused releases.
 



  





**Good Fit If You** 




  





 \\*  Like getting ""hands\\-on"" with testing rather than only writing scripts.
 



 \\*  Care deeply about preventing production issues.
 



 \\*  Are comfortable building QA foundations, not just following existing ones.
 



 \\*  Prefer ownership over process\\-heavy environments.

Doctors that use Suki already spend over 70% less time on administrative tasks, and we’re striving to do even better. Come and join us!
   

  

 We are a user\\-driven company and are committed to making sure every pixel of our product is in service of the doctor.
