* Documentation and traceability: maintain checklists, test summaries, and a requirement to test to result traceability matrix. Keep artefacts inspection ready.
* Quality metrics: track pass rates, defect leakage, and re\\-open counts. Share simple weekly reports with owners and dates.
* Collaboration: work daily with Product, Engineering, QA peers, and Implementation to align scope, data, and timelines.
* Continuous improvement: prune flaky cases, tighten test data sets, and standardise reusable checklists.


 What You Bring
   

  

* Experience: 4 to 6 years in manual QA for fintech, payments, or high scale SaaS with multiple production releases.
* Test design mastery: boundary value, equivalence partitioning, state transition, risk based planning, and a tidy traceability matrix from requirement to result.
* API testing: hands on with Postman or SoapUI. You validate side effects with SQL basics and know how to isolate errors and edge cases.
* Data and environments: you craft realistic test data sets, manage sandboxes and certification flows, and use mocks or stubs when dependencies block testing.
* Defect hygiene: crisp steps to reproduce, logs and headers where needed, correct severity and priority, tight retest and closure.
* Collaboration: clear, concise status updates, ability to push back on unclear scope, and early escalation with options and impacts.
* Evidence discipline: checklists, summaries, and versioned artefacts that are audit ready.
* Tooling: Jira, Confluence, and a test case manager such as TestRail or Zephyr. Comfortable with basic Linux and reading service logs.


 Bonus Points
   

  

* Hybrid working model: In\\-office collaboration for design reviews, workshops, and team days, with flexible remote time for deep work. Clear expectations on core hours and availability.

* TimeBack: An educational platform that drives Alpha School's 2\\-hour learning model (achieving 99th percentile test scores).
* Incept: A content generation platform producing all personalized educational materials for multiple learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
* Crossover: An AI\\-driven hiring platform that processes tens of thousands of applicants monthly, staffing schools and organizations worldwide.


 You will take ownership of one of these platforms and dedicate most of your time to building the most complex components of the codebase with a small team (3\\-5 experienced engineers, no junior developers). The architectural choices you make will determine whether other teams can build new applications quickly, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Correct decisions unlock massive leverage. Poor decisions create integration failures and slow down multiple teams.
   

  

 You design, build, and operate what you create. You set the quality standards and establish patterns for your platform. We follow a spec\\-driven approach: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. High autonomy is standard, with no committees or review boards. You work in a small, cohesive team where you are accountable for what you deliver.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Define strategic architectural decisions and set technical patterns for the team to adopt.
* AI Leadership: Champion the adoption of emerging AI workflows and develop high\\-impact playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the complex, mission\\-critical portions of the codebase working alongside your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify that your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality standards.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Acting as an architect without writing code
* Spending time in endless meetings
* Managing people (this role focuses on technical leadership, not personnel management)
* Maintaining legacy systems or internal IT infrastructure


**Basic Requirements**
**Staff Software Engineer key responsibilities**
* At least 5 years of professional software development experience building software products
* At least 3 years serving as either a lead engineer (reviewing others' work) or architect (making key technical decisions)
* Experience developing platform\\-level products where other teams consumed your APIs
* Deep engagement with AI tools, actively experimenting and pushing boundaries


**About LearnWith.AI**
 LearnWith.AI is an edtech startup that leverages AI and subject matter experts to cultivate a new way of learning. Our unique approach leverages 50\\+ years of learning science, cutting\\-edge data analytics and AI\\-powered coaching. In doing so, we can help students learn more, learn faster, and learn better \\- and have fun while doing it. We are a remote\\-first company that hires globally via Crossover.
   

  

 There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!
   

  

**Working with us**
 This is a full\\-time (40 hours per week), long\\-term position. The position is immediately available and requires entering into an independent contractor agreement with Crossover as a Contractor of Record. The compensation level for this role is $100 USD/hour, which equates to $200,000 USD/year assuming 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. The payment period is weekly.
