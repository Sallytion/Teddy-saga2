 5\\+ Years
 



**Tech Stack:**

**The Opportunity: Build the future of Wealth** 




 In a fintech world obsessed with gamification and speculative betting, Endowus stands apart. We aren't here to build another trading app; we are building the financial infrastructure to help people achieve long\\-term life goals \\- retirement, education, and financial freedom.
 







**Headquartered in Singapore, we are the largest independent digital wealth platform in Asia** 
 . However, we are not a one\\-trick robo\\-advisor. We are a full\\-suite wealth platform spanning public equities, fixed income, private markets, and hedge funds. We provide clients with customized exposure—global, regional, or sectoral—across all their wealth (from liquid cash to pension savings) and for all their needs (from short\\-term cash management to long\\-term retirement planning).
 



 Just six years after launch, we manage over
 **US$10 Billion (\\~₹90,000 Crore)** 
 in assets for more than a quarter\\-million clients across Singapore and Hong Kong. We are a Series B company backed by global giants (
 **Lightspeed, Illuminate, Prosus, EDBI, UBS** 
 ), with ambitions to cover the entire region.
 



**This is not an 'offshore' support role.** 
 Our India team is a
 **core product hub** 
 , operating on parity with our Singapore HQ. Engineers here drive end\\-to\\-end ownership of platform innovation. You won't just be maintaining code; you will be architecting the next generation of global wealthtech products.
 



  





**The Role: Building the Interface of Wealth** 




 Most companies treat Frontend as ""making things look pretty.""
 **We treat it as the primary interface of trust** 
 .
 



 For many of our clients, the mobile app
 *is* 
 Endowus. It is the portal through which they manage their life savings. The UI must not only be intuitive but financially accurate, performant, and secure. We are looking for engineers who bridge the gap between complex financial logic and joyous client experiences.
 



  





 Here’s what you can look forward to in this role:
 


* **Engineer the Product Experience** 
 : You will collaborate deeply with Product Designers and PMs. You aren't just translating Figma screens to code; you are defining the interaction models that make complex financial data (like portfolio rebalancing or asset allocation) understandable and actionable for clients.
* **Build for Scale \\& Performance** 
 : You will build advanced, native\\-feeling applications using
 **Flutter** 
 . You will tackle challenges in rendering performance (60fps), complex state management, and platform\\-specific integrations to ensure our app feels instant and robust.
* **Drive Engineering Rigor** 
 : You will treat the frontend with the same discipline as the backend. You will write clean, testable code and maintain a comprehensive suite of automated tests to ensure we ship confidently to production daily.
* **Modernize \\& Evolve** 
 : You will continuously evaluate new web technologies (e.g., modularization patterns, platform channels) to maximize development efficiency. You will guard against ""resume\\-driven development"" while keeping our stack modern.
* **Elevate the Team** 
 : You will mentor other engineers, helping them achieve high levels of productivity and code quality. You will foster a culture where we help each other win.



  





**Our Tech Stack** 



* **Mobile:** 
 Built with
 **Flutter** 
 and
 **Dart** 
 . We target both iOS and Android from a single codebase but respect platform conventions.
* **Testing** 
 : We rely on
 **flutter\\_test** 
 for unit/widget testing and
 **Maestro** 
 for integration testing.
* **Backend Context** 
 : Our backend is Scala/Akka with Event Sourcing. While you focus on the web, you will interact with RESTful APIs backed by this powerful distributed system.
* **Ops** 
 : We are 100% cloud\\-native (AWS) and rely heavily on
 **CI/CD \\& IaC** 
 for automated deployments.



**Want to look under the hood?**

**What Success Looks Like** 



* **First 30 Days (Immersion)** 
 : You understand our design system and our mobile app architecture which supports both SG and HK from the same build. You have released your first feature and understand our ""Conflict\\-Free"" business model.
* **First 90 Days (Ownership)** 
 : You own a critical client journey (e.g., Client Onboarding or Portfolio Investment). You are identifying UX friction points or performance bottlenecks and proposing solutions to Product Managers before they even ask.
* **First 6 Months (Impact)** 
 : You are helping evolve our frontend architecture (e.g., improving build times, modularization). You are mentoring others to have a ""Product Engineer"" mentality—caring as much about the client's ""Why"" as the engineering ""How.""



  





**What You Bring (Requirements)** 




 We care more about your engineering intuition than your ability to memorize APIs. However, this role requires a specific baseline:
 



**Must\\-Haves:** 



* **5\\+ Years of Mobile Engineering** 
 : You have shipped complex, consumer\\-facing apps to the App Store/Play Store.
* **Flutter Expertise (2\\+ Years):** 
 You know Flutter beyond the basics. You understand the rendering pipeline, how BuildContext works, and how to optimize for performance.
* **Native Fluency** 
 : You are fluent in at least one native language (
 **Kotlin, Swift, Objective\\-C, or Java** 
 ) because you know that sometimes Flutter needs help from the native layer.
* **Product \\& Design Sense** 
 : You have a keen eye for design and detail. You can bridge the gap between a static design mock and a responsive, interactive reality. You care about accessibility and animations.
* **Testing Mindset** 
 : You don't rely on manual QA. You are experienced with testing frameworks and believe that a feature isn't done until it's automated.
* **Bias for Action** 
 : You have a history of navigating ambiguity. You don't say ""I'm waiting for the API""; you mock it, build the UI, and unblock yourself.



  





**Nice\\-to\\-Haves:** 



* **Full\\-Stack Exposure** 
 : Experience with Backend\\-for\\-Frontend (BFF) patterns or GraphQL.
* **Analytics \\& Growth** 
 : Experience with tracking solutions (GA4, GTM), feature\\-flagging \\& A/B experimentation.
* **FinTech Domain** 
 : You understand financial concepts or high\\-security requirements (biometrics, encryption).



  





**Why Endowus?** 



* **Modern Stack, Serious Business** 
 : You get to apply a cutting\\-edge stack to mission\\-critical financial infrastructure. You get the intellectual depth of a top\\-tier private bank with the agility of a startup.
* **World\\-Class Engineering Talent** 
 : You will work with colleagues from top product companies like Amazon, Google, Swiggy, Flipkart, Grab, and Meta. We bring together strong fintech DNA with the best of agile startup culture.
* **Career Growth with Upside** 
 : We manage massive AUA ($10 billion and growing) with a lean, high\\-talent team (\\~85 in product engineering). This means high visibility, high impact, and significant ESOP upside in a company that is defining the category.
* **Leadership Pedigree** 
 : Our leadership team brings experience from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, UBS, McKinsey, Bloomberg, Amazon, Alibaba, Grab, Shopee, Salesforce, and more.



  





**Why NOT Endowus?** 




 We want you to thrive here, which means we must be honest about the environment.
 


* **You prefer execution over discovery** 
 : If you do your best work when given a finalized design and a strict specification to implement, you might find our iterative process stressful. We expect engineers to challenge the design and help define the solution, not just code it.
* **You prefer a ""Move Fast and Break Things"" culture** 
 : We move fast, but we manage people's life savings. If you view writing tests or rigorous code reviews as bureaucratic slowdowns, you will likely feel frustrated by our safety culture.
* **You prefer functionality over form** 
 : If you believe that ""getting it to work"" is enough and that alignment, spacing, or micro\\-interactions are secondary concerns for the design team to worry about, this role isn't for you. We value craftsmanship in every pixel.
* **You want 100% Remote** 
 : We work in the office at least 3 days a week because we believe in the serendipity of in\\-person collaboration.



  





**The Interview Process** 




 We respect your time and aim to be thorough yet efficient.
 


* Recruiter Screen (30 min): Quick alignment on role, stack, and mission.
* Online Coding Assessment (60 min): A hands\\-on coding challenge to assess your problem\\-solving fundamentals.
* Technical Deep Dive (60 min): Live coding and discussion. We focus equally on code \\& communication \\- we want to get a feel for what it’ll be like coding everyday next to you.
* System Design (60 min): We talk Mobile Architecture, State Management, and how you handle offline data/sync.
* Culture \\& Values (60 min): Meeting with Leadership to ensure we are a match.



  





**Want to look before you leap?** 




 We know that choosing the right startup is a big decision. If you have hard questions about our roadmap, tech debt, or culture, come ask them directly.
 



**Join our weekly ""Engineering Open House"" with our CTO.** 




 No interview, no pressure \\- just a transparent conversation.
