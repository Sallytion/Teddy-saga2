 The last decade and a half has been dedicated to the rise of convenience in every way. Organisations, one after the other, have created products and services which make the life of customers convenient. Yet the pain, pressure and stress of the modern world has not really reduced, leave aside going away.
 



  





 At Pinch, our dream is to transform the physical environment of a family and help them create space for the truly important things, allowing them to focus on themselves and their mental well\\-being to build a meaningful life, filled with purpose and joy. We wish to build a home management system, which not only does the daily chores, seamlessly and effortlessly, but also preempts the needs of our customers, enhances their lifestyle in every
 



 aspect while giving them the peace of mind to focus on achieving more in life. From full housekeeping to a quick tidy up or a dog walk, Pinch is available for the families all the time. We work as an extension of our customers’ family and bring to the table what is best for them.
 



  





 With our monthly plan, we combine services such as housekeeping, maintenance, food \\& nutrition management, grocery resupply, laundry management, etc. tailored to the unique needs of each family. On top, a dedicated Lifestyle Manager helps them with any miscellaneous home requests, from decorating home with fresh flowers to arranging a repairman for the broken washing machine, to planning details of the next holiday, taking care of children or the elderly. Basically, anything and everything our customers and their families would need to live a comfortable, convenient, healthy, guilt\\-free, and inspired life.

Our team of lifestyle managers are mapped to each family, do all the research, analysis and short list the best products and service experience for the customers.
 



 Trained Professionals: Offering a much more professional service than domestic helpers, with Pinch, customers are served by a team of home specialists who will handle all the housework, chores and running around. If they already have a helper, we will have them trained by us to maximise their potential and effectiveness.
 



 Technology: We take the hassle out of home management. Customers are given constant home and personal management advice, reminders and nudges, where the back\\-end system incorporates an algorithm that remembers preferences and generates instructions to meet our customers’ home goals.
