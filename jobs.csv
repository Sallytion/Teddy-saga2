 • Rapid Iteration: Ship MVPs, test quickly, and improve constantly.
 



 • Lean Infrastructure: Avoid paid services; build with open\\-source and free\\-tier tools.
 



  





 ⸻
 



  





 Required Qualifications
 



 • Bachelor’s or Master’s in CS, Engineering, or a related field.
 



 • Proven track record deploying AI/ML models.
 



 • Strong full\\-stack development experience.
