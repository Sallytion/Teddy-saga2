 Software Development Engineer 2 \\- Into Agentic AI
   

  

**Summary Of The Role**
 We are looking for a
 **Hands\\-on AI Software Developer** 
 to design and ship agentic, multi\\-modal features for the
 **Travel Industry** 
 . This isn't a research role; it’s for a
 **coder** 
 who loves getting their hands dirty in the implementation details of LLMs, agentic loops, and RAG. You will be responsible for building the logic that lets our AI agents execute tasks, use tools, and solve complex problems autonomously. If you are a strong programmer obsessed with making AI actually
 **work** 
 in production, this is for you.
   

  

 In This Role You’ll / Your Main Responsibilities
   

  

* Ship Agentic Features: Write clean, production\\-ready code in Python or Java to implement agent loops, tool\\-calling logic, and agent\\-to\\-agent (A2A) orchestration.
* Build \\& Connect Tools: Develop the APIs and integrations, working knowledge of trade offs between tools call vs. Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent to Agent communication with state management.
* Optimize \\& Evaluate: Move beyond ""vibe checks"" by running automated evaluations (including LLM\\-as\\-a\\-judge) to track metrics, reduce hallucinations, and ensure reliability.
* Full\\-Stack Integration: Collaborate with frontend and backend teams to bridge AI logic with user interfaces, ensuring fast, intuitive, and reliable end\\-to\\-end features.
* Debug \\& Iterate: Take ownership of the ""stochastic"" nature of AI. When an agent fails a task, you’ll trace the execution flow, identify if the issue is in the code or the prompt, and ship a fix.


**About Ideal Candidate**
* Strong Coder First: You have 2–5 years of experience in Python (FastAPI/asyncio) or Java (Quarkus/Spring Boot). You write code that is testable, readable, and maintainable.
* Modern AI Stack: You have hands\\-on experience with LangGraph, Semantic Kernel, or LangChain. You understand embeddings, vector search, tokens \\- how effectively tokens can be used, and how to structure prompts for consistent function calling.
* Cloud Native: You are comfortable working within Microsoft Azure (Azure OpenAI, AI Search) or similar form leading cloud providers ecosystems to deploy and manage AI solutions.
* Autonomous \\& Proactive: You are a self\\-starter who can go from a ""Problem"" to a ""Pull Request"" with minimal supervision, owning your slice of the product from idea to value.
* Practical \\& Fast: You prefer shipping a working MVP today over a ""perfect"" system next month. You know when to use an off\\-the\\-shelf library and when to write a custom implementation from scratch.


**What We Can Offer You**
* 🎯 A critical mission and purpose \\- At Amadeus, you will power the future of travel with a critical mission and extraordinary purpose.
* 🌎 A truly global DNA \\- Everything at Amadeus is global, from our people to our business, which translates into our footprint, processes, and culture.

I am comfortable both supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on key features as appropriate. I have delivered multiple projects that move the needle for the business. I have demonstrated technical breadth and depth; I am an expert in my domain.
   

 At this level I display a high degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team. I am accountable for the quality of every result, produced by individuals and teams. I am an advocate of best practices across my directorate. I build maturity in the way we develop, deliver and operate services. I ensure that we’re learning from the best in the industry, designing and implementing appropriate testing and deployment strategies.
   

 I can anticipate feature evolution of my product. I utilise this when facilitating design sessions to ensure that the system architecture evolves to support future requirements. I understand the wider Tesco architectural strategy and champion its application to the systems that I work on. At this level my job starts to become just as much about exercising technical judgment as it does about implementation.
   

 I am comfortable managing competing priorities and am able to bring order to ambiguous scenarios. I create optimal outcomes combining short\\-term and long\\-term goals, utilising data driven decision making techniques to take appropriate trade\\-offs. I can identify risks and proactively engage with product and programme managers. I am a strong communicator within my team and to my stakeholders.
   

 I am a trusted mentor, a role\\-model for more junior engineers. I am approachable and am frequently asked to mentor those around me. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across the directorate, both informally in 1:1 discussions and by arranging more formal training opportunities.
   

 I build capability and raise the bar by contributing to hiring and interviewing practices. I regularly participate in recruitment assessments. Externally I represent the best of Tesco Technology to attract new talent and encourage interest in our organisation.
