At Atlan, we’re changing that. As the world’s first active metadata platform, we help organisations transform data chaos into clarity and seamless collaboration.
   

  

 From Fortune 500 leaders to hyper\\-growth startups, from automotive innovators redefining mobility to healthcare organisations saving lives, and from Wall Street powerhouses to Silicon Valley trailblazers — we empower ambitious teams across industries to unlock the full potential of their data.
   

  

 Recognised as leaders by Gartner and Forrester and backed by Insight Partners, Atlan is at the forefront of reimagining how humans and data work together. Joining us means becoming part of a movement to shape a future where data drives extraordinary outcomes.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Atlan is building the next generation of its
 **App Framework** 
 , a foundation for developers to orchestrate the extraction, transformation, and loading of metadata from diverse data sources into Atlan’s context store. This modern platform is powered by intelligent apps for publishing, lineage computation, and state diffs, so developers building source\\-specific apps can focus on what truly matters: extracting and enriching metadata from sources..
   

  

 As an
 **App Developer** 
 , you’ll be at the heart of this evolution. You’ll collaborate closely with product managers to understand source\\-specific requirements, curate sandbox environments for development and testing, and use Python to build robust, high\\-quality metadata extraction apps. You’ll dive deep into APIs, protocols, and schemas to surface metadata efficiently, whether via batch jobs or event\\-driven flows.
   

  

 In addition to source apps, you’ll also have the opportunity to work on intelligent apps themselves — the building blocks that power publishing, lineage computation, and state diffing across our ecosystem. Looking ahead, we’re also building AI agents on top of the app framework, unlocking automation and intelligence for metadata ingestion.
   

  

 This is your chance to shape how metadata from hundreds of tools flows into Atlan, while contributing to a PaaS\\-enabled SaaS ecosystem built for developer delight.
   

  

**What will you do? 🤔**
* Build metadata extraction apps for a wide range of databases, SaaS tools, and data systems using Atlan’s App Framework.
* Work with product managers to refine requirements and define what metadata should be extracted and how it’s modeled.
* Explore and connect to sources via APIs, SDKs, and database connectors.
* Write clean, maintainable Python code, leveraging framework abstractions for publishing, lineage computation, and state diffing.
* Test and validate extraction logic using sandboxes and mock environments.
* Contribute to a culture of observability, logging, and structured debugging to ensure metadata flows are reliable.
* Collaborate with the App Framework team to suggest improvements, spot abstraction gaps, and shape the developer experience.


**What makes you a match? 😍**
* Strong fluency in databases — comfortable writing SQL across multiple dialects, with a solid grasp of NoSQL concepts and how schemas evolve across systems.
* A strong grasp of APIs and protocols — HTTP/REST fundamentals, authentication (OAuth2, API keys), pagination, and working with JSON/XML payloads; familiarity with GraphQL is a plus.
* Solid programming skills — writing clean, maintainable scripts and modules, using async patterns where needed, and incorporating tests and logging into your work.
* Good habits around testing, debugging, and observability — writing unit tests, using structured logs, and validating extraction logic in sandboxed environments.
* Curiosity around AI tools — willing to leverage AI to accelerate coding, debugging, and documentation.
* Collaborative mindset to work closely with product managers to clarify requirements and ensure metadata extraction aligns with product goals.


**Why Atlan for You?**
 At Atlan, we believe the future belongs to the humans of data. From curing diseases to advancing space exploration, data teams are powering humanity's greatest achievements. Yet, working with data can be chaotic—our mission is to transform that experience. We're reimagining how data teams collaborate by building the home they deserve, enabling them to create winning data cultures and drive meaningful progress.
   

  

**Joining Atlan Means**
* Ownership from Day One: Whether you're an intern or a full\\-time teammate, you’ll own impactful projects, chart your growth, and collaborate with some of the best minds in the industry.
* Limitless Opportunities: At Atlan, your growth has no boundaries. If you’re ready to take initiative, the sky’s the limit.
* A Global Data Community: We’re deeply embedded in the modern data stack, contributing to open\\-source projects, sponsoring meet\\-ups, and empowering team members to grow through conferences and learning opportunities.


 As a fast\\-growing, fully remote company trusted by global leaders like Cisco, Nasdaq, and HubSpot, we’re creating a category\\-defining platform for data and AI governance. Backed by top investors, we’ve achieved 7X revenue growth in two years and are building a talented team spanning 15\\+ countries.
   

  

 If you’re ready to do your life’s best work and help shape the future of data collaboration, join Atlan and become part of a mission to empower the humans of data to achieve more, together.
   

  

**We are an equal opportunity employer**
 At Atlan, we’re committed to helping data teams do their lives’ best work. We believe that diversity and authenticity are the cornerstones of innovation, and by embracing varied perspectives and experiences, we can create a workplace where everyone thrives.

 Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.
   

  

 Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third\\-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.
   

  

 Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1\\.4B\\+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.
   

  

 We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for a Software Engineer to elevate the Billing platform to the next level. This role entails significant ownership, impact, and visibility in constructing a platform that directly influences Rippling’s growth. Based in Bangalore, this role necessitates cross\\-functional collaboration across every product vertical and function. As we venture into new markets and support new subscription models, we are preparing for unforeseen challenges.
   

  

 Our team oversees the entire customer journey, from initiation to completion.
   

  

 New Customer Onboarding:
   

  

 When a customer selects Rippling, they collaborate with our sales team to finalize product selection, pricing, payment methods, and frequency. The process concludes with contract signing, a process managed entirely by us. The Complexity: Rippling offers over 40 internal products and integrates with hundreds of third\\-party apps in our app store. We manage payment processing and tax compliance, which can vary significantly across countries.
   

  

 Customer Churn Management:
   

  

 Unfortunately, when a customer decides to discontinue using a product or leave Rippling entirely, we manage the churn experience. We coordinate actions with each product; for example, the learning management system may enable customers to download their courses, while the payroll product may offer tax filing options.
   

  

 Invoicing and Subscription Management:
   

  

 We are responsible for invoicing, customer billing, and subscription administration.
   

  

 Key Team Functions:
   

  

 Compliance:
   

  

 Given our pivotal role in processing SaaS fees (approximately $400M), we are crucial for compliance from the engineering perspective. We collaborate with third\\-party auditors, accounting teams, and the CFO to ensure our systems are equipped to handle funds securely.
   

  

 Country Launches:
   

  

 When launching Rippling in a new country, our primary focus is enabling the sales team to initiate sales and close deals efficiently. This involves understanding local contracts, payment infrastructure, tax regulations, and more.
   

  

 Business Analytics:
   

  

 We manage the pipeline for calculating essential metrics such as Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), vital for the Board of Directors, and provide detailed sales insights to refine our strategic approaches.
   

  

****What you’ll do:****
* Confidently ship moderate/large features and improvements with minimal guidance and support from other team members. Collaborate with the team on larger projects
* Modeling and executing against requirements involving complex and interdependent systems
* Taking ambiguous technical problem statements and turning them into an actionable plan, and then executing on it with the team
* Implement comprehensive unit tests for confirming functionality and the quality of code. Ensure high\\-quality code and related documentation.

****Qualifications:****
* 2\\-5 years of professional work experience.
* Strong CS knowledge and expertise.
* Preferred experience with Python, Go, Django, MongoDB, Postgres, AWS
* Experience in building projects with good abstractions and architecture


 Join us at Rippling and contribute to the advancement of our innovative payroll product.
