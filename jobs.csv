**Athenian Project** 
 : In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.
   

  

**1\\.1\\.1\\.1**

**Unifize is Looking for:******
**Backend Engineer \\- AI Platform**
**Job Location: Bangalore, India**
**Experience : 3 \\- 5 years**
**About Unifize:**
 At Unifize, we’re building the AI\\-native product suite for regulated manufacturing companies.
   

  

 Our platform is designed to unify Quality, Operations, and R\\&D in a single collaborative
   

  

 system.
   

  

 Today, life sciences and other regulated manufacturers rely on a patchwork of disconnected
   

  

 tools, e.g., QMS, DMS, PLM, MES, spreadsheets, and email, to manage their processes. This
   

  

 fragmentation slows down innovation, increases compliance risks, and forces teams to
   

  

 waste time manually connecting the dots.
   

  

 Unifize changes that by bringing process, documentation, and communication together in
   

  

 one place. Whether it's managing CAPAs, resolving deviations, launching new products, or
   

  

 preparing for audits, Unifize enables teams to work faster with full traceability and audit
   

  

 readiness built in.
   

  

**What makes Unifize different:**
* No\\-code configuration for rapid deployment and adaptation
* Collaboration embedded in every record, not siloed in email or chat
* Context\\-aware AI that suggests actions, detects risks, and enhances productivity
* Flexible architecture that supports expansion across QMS, DMS, MES, PLM, CMMS,


 and more
   

  

 We’re already working with leading companies in the life sciences and manufacturing
   

  

 sectors. Our customers start with one use case and consistently expand, with 100% net
   

  

 expansion to date.
   

  

 Check out our website, case studies, videos to learn more.
   

  

**The Role:**
 We're building a new AI Platform microservice that integrates tightly with our core
   

  

 Clojure\\-based system. This role involves leading backend development for this service,
   

  

 primarily in Python, working on AI/ML integrations and microservices architecture, and
   

  

 ensuring robust data handling via PostgreSQL.
   

  

 We don’t expect prior experience with Clojure but value curiosity and a willingness to learn.
   

  

 This role is a good fit for engineers who enjoy ownership, functional programming principles,
   

  

 and building infrastructure that powers intelligent applications.
   

  

**Responsibilities:**
* Own and build Python\\-based backend services that interface with AI models and


 core product workflows
   

  

* Design and manage scalable PostgreSQL and vector database schemas and queries
* Develop and maintain RESTful APIs
* Collaborate with the platform and frontend teams to ensure clean integration with the


 larger Unifize system
   

  

* Contribute to design decisions, including service boundaries, API structure, and data


 pipelines
   

  

* Write clean, well\\-tested code and proactively review others' work


**Qualifications:**
* Strong proficiency in Python, with emphasis on clean, modular design
