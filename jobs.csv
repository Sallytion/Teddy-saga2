In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.
