**$2,500 \\- $6,000 /month  (₹225,000 \\- ₹540,000/ month)** 





 For those who want to build the intelligent infrastructure of the future.
 




**Engineers wanted for a mission of consequence.** 





 High expectations. High pressure.
 





 Ambiguous requirements. Incomplete information.
 





 Systems that must work flawlessly in the real world.
 





 Breakthroughs required. Mediocrity impossible.
 




**Comfort not provided.** 




**Significance not guaranteed.** 





 This is not a career move.
 





 This is a commitment to cause.
 





 If you’re the engineer who feels most alive when the opportunities are real, the problems are complex, and the work actually changes how industries operate—
 




  






 if something in you
 
*aches* 

 to build the future instead of watching it unfold—
 




 then what follows is written for you.
 



  





**Why We Exist** 




  






 We are building the intelligent infrastructure that will redefine how companies operate across every domain of business.
 





 Not someday.
 





 Not theoretically.
 




**Now.** 





 Our mission is simple and radical:
 




**Define how business functions in the intelligent era — and make the tools of transformation accessible to anyone eager enough to use them.** 





 We believe the future is not something that happens to us.
 





 It’s something built by those who care enough to shape it.
 





 We are constructing systems that:
 



* read and understand thousands of documents per day
* coordinate critical workflows in seconds
* automate the operations of firms and organizations across the globe
* eliminate drudgery so professionals can operate at full intelligence
* unify data, knowledge, and decisions into fully\\-composable digital operating systems
* turn entire businesses into intelligent, adaptive systems




 This mission is enormous.
 





 It is demanding.
 





 It is unforgiving.
 





 But for those who feel the fire of genuine passion —
 





 those who get energy from creating great things from nothing —
 





 This mission is also deeply, unmistakably
 
*meaningful.* 




**What This Role Really Is** 





 This is not a “Senior Full\\-Stack Engineer” role.
 





 This is a Founding Engineer position in a company aiming to become one of the highest\\-functioning AI organizations of our era — an organization whose systems will sit beneath the workflows of entire industries, whose fingerprints will be everywhere the intelligent era takes hold.
 




  





  






 You will:
 



* **Build foundational systems, not features.**
* **Architect primitives and pipelines that future engineers will depend on.**
* **Work directly with the founder in high\\-bandwidth cycles of ideation, architecture, and execution.**
* **Design mechanisms that make AI feel inevitable, seamless, and profoundly reliable.**
* **Touch every layer of the stack and every layer of the mission.**
* **Produce real systems that real professionals depend on every day.**
* **Transform industries not through theory, but through code.**




 You will be a co\\-author of OAISIS itself.
 





 If that excites you more than it scares you — keep reading.
 




  





**Who You Must Be** 





 You are only right for this role if you feel genuinely — almost irrationally — aligned with the OAISIS mission.
 





 This is not work you
 
*like* 

 doing.
 




 This is work you
 *must* 

 do.
 





 You:
 



* **believe the intelligent era is happening now — and you want to help define it**
* **feel an internal fire to build tools that elevate human capability**
* **want your work to touch thousands and eventually millions of lives**
* **see the future coming and want to shape its architecture, not react to it**
* **take joy in creating elegance out of complexity**
* **lean toward action, momentum, and initiative — not waiting**
* **thrive where the stakes are high and the definitions are fluid**
* **operate with founder\\-level ownership**
* **feel the pull to build something that outlasts you**




 If this doesn’t feel like you in your bones — stop here.
 





 If it does — you’re exactly who we built this role for.
 




  






 Most engineers want a job that challenges them.
 






**You want a mission that transforms you.** 





 Most engineers want a clear roadmap.
 






**You want the chance to draw the map and build the road.** 





 Most engineers want stability.
 






**You want an arena big enough for your potential.** 





 The Role
 





 We’re hiring for two tracks:
 



1. **Senior Full\\-Stack Engineer — Backend Focus**
2. **Senior Full\\-Stack Engineer — Frontend Focus**




 Both are founding\\-engineer roles with direct influence on:
 



* the core primitives of the intelligent business stack
* the architectural patterns used across industries
* the mechanisms that will scale into products, platforms, and eventual ventures
* the evolution of OAISIS itself




 You won’t be building “client projects.”
 





 You’ll be building infrastructure disguised as client projects.
 





 Every engagement we take is strategic:
 



* It exposes a new pattern.
* It reveals a missing primitive.
* It uncovers a cross\\-industry bottleneck.
* It gives us real\\-world stress tests.
* It helps us define the universal architecture required for the intelligent era.




 You will be building the substrate, not the surface.
 




  





**TRACK 1 — Backend\\-Focused Founding Engineer** 





 You will build the internal machinery of the intelligent era.
 





 You must be capable of:
 





 1\\. Architecting and operating large\\-scale intelligent systems
 




*Designing resilient service architectures • multi\\-tenant data isolation • Postgres \\& Mongo mastery • vector retrieval optimization • distributed task pipelines • real\\-time ingestion loops • event\\-driven processing • fault\\-tolerant workers* 





 2\\. Building and deploying production\\-grade AI infrastructure
 




*FastAPI MCP\\-compatible backends • LangChain/LangGraph agents • Gemini/OpenAI SDK integration* 




*• embeddings \\& RAG systems* 





 3\\. Owning full lifecycle engineering, end\\-to\\-end
 




*Dockerized microservices • Cloud\\-native deployments (GCP/AWS/Azure) • Observability \\& tracing systems • API contract design • Maintainable internal libraries • Documentation \\& operational clarity* 





 4\\. Enforcing security, trust, and compliant system design
 




*RBAC \\& JWT strategy • OAuth2 flows • data privacy controls • audit\\-ready logging • tenant isolation boundaries • secret management • input validation • hardened endpoints • compliant architecture patterns* 




  






 This is where the backbone of the mission is built.
 




  





**TRACK 2 — Frontend\\-Focused Founding Engineer** 





 You will design the human interface to the intelligent era.
 





 You must be capable of:
 





 1\\. Crafting intelligent, agent\\-ready user experiences
 




*reactive agent interfaces • dynamic context panels • task\\-aware UI flows • structured feedback loops • conversational \\+ form\\-based hybrids • seamless human\\-AI co\\-operation patterns* 





 2\\. Designing world\\-class product experiences and visual systems
 




*pixel\\-precise interaction design • typography \\& spacing mastery • layout systems that scale • component architecture thinking • high\\-fidelity UX craft from wireframe → polish* 





 3\\. Building high\\-performance, modern React applications
 




*React mastery • advanced TypeScript modeling • Next.js • state machines \\& complex UI logic • realtime rendering \\& streaming UX • robust component\\-driven architecture* 





 4\\. Owning the entire interface development lifecycle
 




*rapid prototyping • accessible design principles • design\\-system creation \\& stewardship • collaboration with backend \\& agent teams • scalable frontend build pipelines \\& workflows* 




**Compensation Built for the 1%** 





 We designed an incentive architecture specifically to attract
 
**the rare self\\-propelling engineer** 

 who wants to grow into a founding role.
 





 It rewards:
 





  ● speed ● clarity ● contribution
 




**PHASE 1 — Proving Ground** 




**0–90 Days — $2,500/month (₹225,000/ month)** 





 Identity:
 
*The Exception* 





 “Prove you’re the outlier.”
 





 We evaluate: pace, clarity, ownership, alignment, architectural instinct.
 




  





**PHASE 2 — Core Contributor** 




**90 Days → 6 Months — $4,000/month (₹360,000/ month)** 





 Identity:
 
*Cornerstone Candidate* 





 “You’ve shown you belong. Now show you matter.”
 




**PHASE 3 — Founding Engineer Track** 




**6 Months → Year 2 — $6,000/month (₹540,000/ month)** 





 Identity:
 
*The Builder* 





 Own systems.
