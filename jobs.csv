 MeasureOne is the leading consumer\\-permissioned data exchange platform, transforming how businesses access and use consumer data — with privacy, consent, and security at the core. Our platform enables organisations to verify and integrate trusted consumer information across domains like income, employment, education, and student enrollment — all powered by advanced automation, AI, and a secure consent\\-based architecture.
 



  





 Headquartered in San Francisco, with a global engineering centre in India, we are calling our platform to handle increasingly complex data ecosystems.
 



  





**What we are looking for?**




  





 Our platform is built on a distributed, service\\-oriented architecture involving Core APIs, data ingestion services, parsing pipelines, analytics workflows, and billing systems. As the platform scales, maintaining architectural consistency, reliability, and clarity is critical.
 



  





 We are seeking a Principal Engineer to help us strengthen our system design governance and architectural scalability as we grow. This is a hands\\-on technical leadership role — designed for someone who can bridge product context, system architecture, and execution depth. This role is not a people\\-management role. You’ll partner directly with the CTO to codify and evolve MeasureOne’s architecture across our micro\\-services ecosystem, data pipelines, and API framework. You will design, build, and guide by doing — working deeply within our systems and teams to elevate design quality, scalability, and maintainability.
 



  





**What you’ll be doing?**




  





**Architecture \\& Design Governance** 



* Review and guide architectural decisions across Core API, Parser, data pipelines, analytics, and supporting services.
* Ensure design consistency, API standards, and data model clarity across services.
* Establish and maintain lightweight design review practices (design docs, ADRs, RFCs).
* Identify architectural risks early and propose pragmatic improvements.



  





**Hands\\-on Technical Contribution** 



* Read, understand, and review existing Java/Spring Boot/NodeJS codebases.
* Support engineers with design\\-level problem solving (not ticket execution).
* Participate in complex debugging, refactoring, and system\\-level improvements when needed.



  





**System Understanding \\& Documentation** 



* Build a deep understanding of existing system flows and dependencies.
* Document key architectural decisions, service boundaries, and data flows.
* Help convert implicit system knowledge into shared, usable documentation.



  





**Collaboration** 



* Work with the CTO/Director\\-Product on architecture alignment.
* Collaborate with Engineering Managers to support design quality without disrupting delivery.
* Partner with Product and QA teams where architecture impacts product behaviour or quality.



  





**What skills you need to succeed in this role?**




  





**Core Technical Background** 



* Strong Experience in back\\-end product platform engineer in any one programming language (Node.JS/Java/Javascript/C\\+\\+).
* Experience working with micro\\-services and distributed systems.
* Solid understanding of REST APIs, service contracts, and integration patterns.
* Experience designing systems using both relational (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB/Redis) databases.
* Familiarity with asynchronous workflows, schedulers, or event\\-based processing.



  





**Architecture Mindset** 



* Has owned or strongly influenced system\\-level design decisions.
* Understands trade\\-offs, not just tools.
* Comfortable maintaining and improving existing systems (not only greenfield builds).
* Experience participating in or leading design reviews or architecture discussions.



  





**Working Style \\& Fit** 



* Hands\\-on, detail\\-oriented, and comfortable reading complex code.
* Prefers technical ownership over people management.
* Able to work in a technically deep environment.
* Pragmatic, collaborative, and low\\-ego.
* Willing to invest time to deeply understand the system before proposing changes.



  





**Remuneration**

**About Us**
 We are an enterprise\\-grade integration platform provider for asset\\-intensive organizations, delivering mission\\-critical synchronization between
 **GIS** 
 and
 **Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)** 
 systems. Our cloud\\-native platform is designed to help utilities and infrastructure operators configure, operate, and monitor complex data integrations with confidence.
   

  

 We operate in a highly technical domain where correctness, clarity, and reliability matter. Our engineers work on real\\-world, mission\\-critical systems used by large utility companies and local government entities every day.
   

  

**The Role**
 We are looking for a
 **Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)** 
 to own
 **end to\\-end test automation and product quality** 
 across our platforms. This is a hands\\-on engineering role for someone who treats quality as a
 **system\\-level responsibility** 
 , not a phase at the end of delivery.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Design, build, and maintain end\\-to\\-end automated test frameworks using Playwright, Cypress, or similar modern automation frameworks.
* Write and maintain UI, API, integration, and workflow\\-level automated tests that validate real customer scenarios.
* Embed quality deeply into the development lifecycle by partnering closely with software engineers and product teams.
* Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring fast, reliable feedback for every change.
* Reduce flaky tests, long execution times, and false failures that erode trust in automation.
* Identify high\\-risk system areas (integration boundaries, asynchronous workflows, data transformations) and define targeted test strategies.
* Investigate test failures and escaped defects, perform root cause analysis, and drive durable fixes.
* Define and promote testing standards, automation best practices, and quality strategies across teams.


**What You Bring**
* 7\\+ years of experience as an SDET, Software Engineer in Test, or Software Engineer with significant test automation ownership.
* Strong proficiency in TypeScript and/or JavaScript.
* Hands\\-on experience with modern test automation frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium\\-based frameworks, or similar).
* Experience testing APIs, distributed systems, and asynchronous workflows.
* Experience integrating test suites into CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or similar).
* Ability to read and reason about production code to design effective and maintainable tests.
* Strong debugging, analytical, and problem\\-solving skills.
* Clear communication skills and the ability to influence quality outcomes without formal authority.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience with integration platforms, data pipelines, or workflow\\-driven systems.
* Familiarity with cloud\\-native architectures and containerized environments.
* Exposure to performance, reliability, or resilience testing.
* Experience supporting enterprise or B2B products with complex configurations and long\\-lived customers.


**Why Join US**
* Work on mission\\-critical systems used by utilities and public\\-sector organizations.
* Solve complex, real\\-world integration problems where quality genuinely matters.

 , not a phase at the end of delivery.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Design, build, and maintain end\\-to\\-end automated test frameworks using Playwright, Cypress, or similar modern automation frameworks.
* Write and maintain UI, API, integration, and workflow\\-level automated tests that validate real customer scenarios.
* Embed quality deeply into the development lifecycle by partnering closely with software engineers and product teams.
* Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring fast, reliable feedback for every change.
* Reduce flaky tests, long execution times, and false failures that erode trust in automation.
* Identify high\\-risk system areas (integration boundaries, asynchronous workflows, data transformations) and define targeted test strategies.
* Investigate test failures and escaped defects, perform root cause analysis, and drive durable fixes.
* Define and promote testing standards, automation best practices, and quality strategies across teams.


**What You Bring**
* 7\\+ years of experience as an SDET, Software Engineer in Test, or Software Engineer with significant test automation ownership.
* Strong proficiency in TypeScript and/or JavaScript.
* Hands\\-on experience with modern test automation frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium\\-based frameworks, or similar).
* Experience testing APIs, distributed systems, and asynchronous workflows.
* Experience integrating test suites into CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or similar).
* Ability to read and reason about production code to design effective and maintainable tests.
* Strong debugging, analytical, and problem\\-solving skills.
* Clear communication skills and the ability to influence quality outcomes without formal authority.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience with integration platforms, data pipelines, or workflow\\-driven systems.
* Familiarity with cloud\\-native architectures and containerized environments.
* Exposure to performance, reliability, or resilience testing.
* Experience supporting enterprise or B2B products with complex configurations and long\\-lived customers.


**Why Join US**
* Work on mission\\-critical systems used by utilities and public\\-sector organizations.
* Solve complex, real\\-world integration problems where quality genuinely matters.
* Operate in an engineering culture that values ownership, pragmatism, and outcomes over process.
* Influence how quality is designed into the system—not just tested after the fact.
