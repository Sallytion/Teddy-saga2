We're Recruiting a Co\\-conspirator** 




  





 At Mavic.ai, we are building the world's first AI brand marketer that's making traditional marketing agencies sweat. We're the rebels who decided that marketing shouldn't require a crystal ball, a Fortune 500 budget, or teams with 17 different tools that don't talk to each other.
 



**The Plot Twist:** 
 We need someone who gets as excited about fixing customer (and workflow) pain points as they do about producing the coolest code.
 



  





**What We're Actually Looking For** 




  





 We don’t care about b\\*llshit bingo resumes. We don’t use an LLM to evaluate what your LLM optimized.
 



  





 We want someone who:
 


* **Thinks like a chess player:** 
 single
 **moves** 
 impact the
 **long term** 
 board position
* **Codes like a leopard** 
 :
 **fast** 
 ,
 **gracious** 
 and
 **focused**
* **Shapes UI like Michelangelo: sees the block of stone, carves out the statue**
* **Creates the UX** 
 as if your mother would use it
* **Investigates like Jessica Fletcher** 
 when solving problems: “where’s the corpse?”
* **Prioritises like Pareto** 
 : 20/80 all the way
* **Communicates** 
 like an owl: simple, straightforward and respectful



  





**Translation:** 
  An effective team member being able to deal with uncertainties and deliver under pressure.
 



  





**What we’re Building** 




 Mavic.ai isn’t “just a ChatGPT wrapper” — it’s the marketing brain lacking in many businesses.
 



 We’re creating an AI brand strategist and executor that helps any level of marketer make full use of their creativity. Even if the execution skills do not match up. Mavic thinks ahead: it
 **strategizes** 
 ,
 **plans** 
 ,
 **creates** 
 ,
 **schedules** 
 , and
 **analyzes** 
 . It learns what works,
 **doubles down** 
 on it, and cuts out the noise.
 



 The result? A single product that replaces the pile of disconnected tools marketers and founders wrestle with every day — and actually improves impact, by a lot!
 



  





 At its core, Mavic is an application built for the real world — also used on mobile, designed to be intuitive, and powerful enough to feel like a whole team hiding behind one login.
 



  





**Your Mission (Should You Choose to Accept It)** 



* Build and Fix Backend and Frontend code for end\\-users and internal users
* Deal with less than optimal / fixed requirements
* Make design decisions in architecture, application layers and UI, but know when to ask
* Slice big tasks into manageable work packages to estimate effort and prioritisation
* Document code and decision for future reference



  





**Why This Isn't Your Average Role** 




**🎯 Real Impact, Day One** 
 Your work directly influences how thousands of marketers, founders and executive do marketing. 
 



**🧠 Learn from the Best** 
 Work alongside founders who've built companies from 0 before. 
 



**🌍 Remote but part of the core team** 
 We’re a small but focused team
 



**💡 AI\\-First Everything** 
 You'll be integrating cutting\\-edge AI tools daily and get early access to features before they hit the market. It's like having superpowers.
 



 🔭
 **Aiming for the stars** 
 As AI tech evolves very rapidly, we adapt and integrate when it helps our customers achieve their goals. We do things others omit (or don’t think about). 
 



  





**What You Bring to the Table** 




**Must\\-Haves:** 



* You’ve shipped production\\-level applications with
 **Node.js** 
 ,
 **React Web** 
 , and
 **MongoDB** 
 (not just side projects—real, running, user\\-facing stuff).
* Prior work with
 **LLM models** 
 or
 **APIs** 
 (OpenAI, LangChain, HuggingFace, etc.)—not just consuming, but integrating in creative, scalable ways.
* You’ve danced with
 **microservices** 
 ,
 **event\\-driven architectures** 
 , or
 **GraphQL** 
 and know when they’re a lifesaver vs. overkill.
* You wield web technologies like a Swiss Army knife:
 **serverless** 
 ,
 **latency** 
 tuning,
 **scalability** 
 , security patches—you know when to optimize and when to ship.
* You’re fluent in
 **data structures** 
 and persistence models, can normalize when needed, and know when async beats sync (and when it doesn’t).
* GitHub isn’t just your
 **repo** 
 —it’s your
 **dojo** 
 . You’re confident with version control, branching strategies, and pull requests that others actually want to review.
* You’ve
 **dabbled with AI\\-assisted** 
 coding and know how to use it as an accelerator, not a crutch.
* You design for
 **non\\-technical humans** 
 , making UX so smooth that your non\\-coder aunt can use it without asking what a “404” is.
* **Mobile optimization** 
 chops—our users live on their phones, and you know how to make a web app sing on a 5\\-inch screen.
* You’re battle\\-tested at
 **debugging** 
 : logs, stack traces, “why the hell isn’t this working?”—you get to the root cause, not the band\\-aid fix.
* You think in
 **systems, not silos** 
 —you understand how backend choices ripple into frontend experiences (and vice versa).
* **English communication** 
 (speaking and writing) isn’t about buzzwords for you—you communicate clearly and respectfully, whether in async docs, Slack threads, or a quick video call.



**Bonus Points For:** 



* Experience working with a distributed, remote\\-first team across time zones without becoming a ghost.
* DevOps know\\-how: spinning up CI/CD pipelines, wrangling Docker, or navigating AWS/GCP/Azure without crying.
* An eye for UI/UX design details—you don’t just accept the default styling, you care about pixels, padding, and polish.
* Performance tuning wizardry—from caching strategies to shaving milliseconds off load times.
* A knack for writing tech docs that don’t suck—others can actually follow them without coffee IV drips.
* Startup scars: you’ve thrived (or at least survived) in high\\-speed, low\\-certainty environments where requirements change mid\\-sentence.



**Personality Traits We Value:** 



* **Intellectual Curiosity:** 
 You actually enjoy figuring out how things work
* **Self Management:** 
 No micromanagement here
* **Adaptability:** 
 Comfortable with ambiguity and rapid changes (startup life!)
* **Initiative:** 
 You see opportunities and take action
* **Collaboration:** 
 Knows when to ask for help
* **Growth Mindset:** 
 Views feedback as fuel for improvement, not criticism



**What Success Looks Like** 




**After 14 Days:** 



* You understand the code base structure
* You are able to investigate and fix bugs and find the root cause of issues
* You implemented the first upgrades to our customers’ user experience
* You understand Mavic’s mission and how it translates to your role
* You know you’re team members by name and predict what they’re up to in the weekend



**After 60 Days:** 



* You have brought multiple features to production
* You cleaned up stale code and improved management of the total architecture
* Your family members need to stop you talking about Mavic at birthday parties.
* You form a well running machine together with your colleagues
* You’ve made miracles happen



**The Details** 




**📍 Work mode:** 
 Remote (with periodical in\\-person meet ups in South East Asia)
 



**🗓️ Schedule:** 
 Full\\-time
 



**💰 Compensation:** 
 Yes, let’s talk
