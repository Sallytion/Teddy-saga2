But unlike software (with observability platforms such as AppDynamics and Datadog), construction teams lack automated feedback loops to help projects stay on schedule and on budget. Without this observability, construction wastes a whopping $3T per year because glitches aren’t detected fast enough to recover.
   

  

 Doxel AI exists to bring computer vision to construction, so the industry can deliver what society needs to thrive. From hospitals to data centers, from foreman to VPs of construction, teams use Doxel to make better decisions everyday. In fact, Doxel has contributed to the construction of the facilities that provide many of the products and services you use everyday.
   

  

 We have LLM\\-driven automation, classic computer vision, deep learning ML object detection, a low\\-latency 3D three.js web app, and a complex data pipeline powering it all in the background. We’re building out new workflows, analytics dashboards, and forecasting engines. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
   

  

 We're at an exciting stage of scale as we build upon our growing market momentum. Our software is trusted by Shell Oil, Genentech, HCA healthcare, Kaiser, Turner, Layton and several others. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
   

  

**The Role**
 As a Navisworks Engineer, your mission is to revolutionize construction job sites by creating powerful tools within Navisworks that capture, process, and visualize project data for Doxel customers. You will collaborate with VDC engineers, Product, Design, Backend, CV/ML teams to deliver seamless, responsive, and visually compelling user experiences. Your work will directly influence how foremen, project managers, and executives make mission\\-critical decisions on job sites worldwide.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Develop and maintain AEC plugins using .NET (C\\#) and other relevant technologies to enhance construction workflows
* Design and implement robust Windows\\-based applications that integrate with Doxel’s backend APIs and data pipelines
* Collaborate closely with Product Managers, Designers, and Backend Engineers, VDC engineers and operations to deliver seamless end\\-to\\-end solutions
* Optimize Navisworks plugin performance for handling large, complex 3D models efficiently
* Ensure robust testing, monitoring, and debugging practices to maintain high software quality
* Stay up to date with Navisworks API updates and best practices for plugin development
* Mentor engineers and promote best practices in Windows and plugin development


**What You’ll Bring To The Team**
* 3\\+ years of professional experience in software development with expertise in Navisworks plugin development
* Strong C\\#/.NET programming skills with experience in Navisworks API and Windows application development
* Experience with Autodesk Forge, Revit API, or BIM data integration is a plus
* Strong understanding of 3D model visualization, performance optimization, and state management
* Experience with RESTful APIs, database integrations, and modern software development practices
* Proficiency in debugging, profiling, and optimizing Windows\\-based applications
* Experience with CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and deployment
* Independent, strong problem\\-solving and Soft skills with the ability to debug and fix issues efficiently
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related technical field
