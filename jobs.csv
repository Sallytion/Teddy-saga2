* Maintain and extend integrations with multiple dental PMS platforms (and later medical PMS/EHRs)
* Sync patients, appointments, insurance plans, claims, and payments reliably across systems
* Troubleshoot vendor changes, inconsistent APIs, and legacy database quirks



  





**Payer automation and verification** 



* Build and maintain browser automation for insurance portals (eligibility checks, claim status, etc.)
* Handle MFA/OTP flows, session management, rate limiting, and UI changes that break scrapers
* Improve reliability in headless environments and production queue workflows



**Claims and revenue cycle workflows** 



* Implement claim scrubbing logic and rules\\-driven processing
* Extract data from EOBs and PDFs using OCR and document parsing
* Parse and validate EDI/X12 transactions (835/837\\) and reconcile posting into PMS systems



**Platform and product work** 



* Build and improve internal web UI for operations teams (work queues, status views, audit trails)
* Add new API endpoints, build migrations, improve observability, and support production operations
* Optimize SQL and performance for high\\-throughput, multi\\-tenant scenarios



  




**Tech stack (current)** 
* Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express
* Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind
* Database: PostgreSQL (including performance\\-focused SQL usage)
* Cloud: AWS services plus modern document/OCR tooling
* Automation: Puppeteer/Playwright\\-style browser automation and cloud browser orchestration
* AI: LLM\\-assisted workflows for structured extraction and claim intelligence



  




**What we are looking for (must\\-have)** 
* 4\\+ years building production systems in TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js backend)
* Strong SQL skills (joins, CTEs, performance tuning, data integrity thinking)
* Solid React experience (hooks, component architecture, state management)
* Experience integrating external systems and APIs (auth, retries, error handling)
* Web automation/scraping experience (Puppeteer, Playwright, or similar)
* Strong Git hygiene and comfort working in an existing codebase



  





  




**Strongly preferred** 
* Healthcare workflows familiarity (eligibility, claims, EOBs, payment posting)
* Experience with legacy system integration (older databases, vendor\\-specific quirks)
* OCR/document processing experience (PDFs, tables, extraction pipelines)
* Queue processing patterns (idempotency, retry logic, concurrency control)
* EDI/X12 experience (835/837\\)


**The mindset that wins here** 
* You can embrace complexity without panicking (some modules are big and integration\\-heavy)
* You know when to refactor vs patch (pragmatism beats perfection)
* You debug like a detective (across PMS, our platform, payer portals, and back)


**Why this is interesting** 
* Real business impact: your work directly reduces manual effort and increases collections
* Complex technical surface area: integrations, automation, OCR, EDI, multi\\-tenant scaling
* Clear roadmap: dental PMS expansion first, then broader medical PMS/EHR coverage
* Equity ownership in the company


**How to apply** 

**Send your LinkedIn profile \\+ a short note on:** 



* A hard integration you shipped
* A scraper/automation you made resilient
* A production bug you chased across multiple systems



  





**(And yes, you can include the story where the vendor changed their UI overnight. We have support group meetings for that.)** 



* **PS: This is a high\\-ownership, high\\-output environment. We move fast, ship continuously, and prioritize customer impact over comfort. If you want a role where you can switch off at 5pm every day, this won’t be a fit.
