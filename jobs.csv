 TGH Tech is a product development company that builds thoughtful, scalable digital products, both our own and for a small group of long\\-term partner startups. We work closely with founders and CTOs of early\\-stage, fast\\-growing companies to help shape their technical and product foundations.
 



 We do not operate like a traditional agency. Our engineers embed into partner teams and take real ownership of systems, architecture, and feature direction. We focus on building reliable, high\\-quality platforms with a strong product mindset, prioritizing long\\-term scalability, performance, and real user impact over short\\-term delivery.
 



 Our goal is simple: build products that are robust, user\\-centric, and built to last.
 



  





**Role Overview** 




  





 This is a hands\\-on technical leadership role for a product\\-minded engineer who wants to work close to real product decisions.
 



 You will work directly with CTOs, founders, and product leaders at early\\-stage and scaling startups, often helping define how systems are designed before they are fully formed. You will lead feature execution, guide technical direction, and mentor a small team of engineers while remaining involved in critical parts of the codebase.
 



 This role is ideal for someone who enjoys building production systems from early architecture through scale and wants exposure to multiple modern, ambitious product companies, including teams working on AI\\-driven and real\\-time platforms.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities** 




  




* Lead the design and execution of core product features from early architecture to production
* Split time between hands\\-on development and technical leadership
* Break down ambiguous product goals into clear, actionable technical plans
* Translate high\\-level initiatives into clear PRDs and technical documentation when needed
* Own feature quality, testing, performance, and long\\-term maintainability
* Perform code reviews and mentor engineers in building scalable, product\\-focused systems
* Guide architectural decisions with an emphasis on simplicity, reliability, and growth readiness
* Drive incremental improvements to code quality, performance, and developer workflows



  





**Technical Requirements** 




  




* 3\\+ years of professional software engineering experience
* Production experience with React and Next.js or similar modern React\\-based frameworks
* Strong knowledge of TypeScript and modern frontend practices
* Backend experience with Node.js\\-based systems
* Experience with real\\-time systems is a strong plus
* Familiarity with SQL databases; Supabase experience is a plus
* Comfort working in fast\\-moving, early\\-stage startup environments



  





**Engineering Standards and Quality** 




  




* Focus on shipping meaningful features quickly while maintaining pragmatic quality
* Emphasis on clean, readable code and continuous refactoring
* Performance\\-aware development and system reliability
* Ability to balance speed, simplicity, and long\\-term maintainability without over\\-engineering



  





**Communication and Collaboration** 




  




* Strong written and spoken English
* Comfortable writing technical documentation and PRDs asynchronously
* Async\\-first working style
* Direct collaboration with CTOs, founders, and product leadership on technical execution



  





**Decision Making and Ownership** 




  




* Take full ownership of feature delivery, quality, and technical outcomes
* Proactively suggest and implement incremental technical and product improvements
* Make pragmatic technical decisions aligned with both product goals and business context



  





**Why Join Us?** 




  




* Work directly with CTOs and founders of early\\-stage, fast\\-scaling startups
* Help shape core technical and product decisions before systems are locked in
* Build and ship multiple production\\-grade products, not just internal tools
* Gain exposure to AI\\-driven platforms, real\\-time systems, and modern product stacks
* Grow as a product\\-focused engineer who understands both technology and business impact
* Be part of a lean team where your technical judgment and product thinking genuinely matter



  





**Who This Role Is For** 




 This role is best suited for engineers who:
 



  




* Care about what gets built as much as how it is built
* Enjoy working close to product and business decisions
* Prefer ownership and impact over narrowly defined task execution
* Are comfortable operating in environments where systems and products are still evolving","Software Development","https://in.linkedin.com/company/tghtech","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGk7CIwCvqW5Q/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1689928059117?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=DirqmjIY-2yNUOmR9gYpiiTUKnIig6dWTxGfo8tpc84","","","","","","","","","","",""
