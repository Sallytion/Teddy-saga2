 Innoviti’s aim is to fuel India’s growth by helping drive a cashless economy. We believe this will release a tremendous amount of money in the Indian market that will ease the availability of credit to fuel entrepreneurship, create jobs and improve the living standards of every Indian. Only technology and a talented team that can put technology to use can address this tough problem.
   

  

 Innoviti is a well\\-funded company backed by marquee investors such as Titan Company (JV between Tata Group and TIDCO) and Catamaran Ventures (founded by Mr. N. R. Narayana Murthy) and NIIC, Canada. The company has been winner of several awards including Deloitte fastest growing company in APAC award three years in a row and Red Herring award twice. We hold 4 patents with 7 more in pipeline.
   

  

 Our business involves developing products that use technology to remove friction in a) the supply of money (credit) and b) movement of money. These seemingly simple objectives are actually very tough problems. Today less than 7% of entrepreneurs get access to capital to grow. Less than 8% of purchases happen through electronic money. Solving these tough problems in sustainable ways that are scalable and profitable is a tough challenge!
   

  

 To address these problems we have built some remarkable products such as uniPAY and smelending.com that today process more than Rs 10,000 Cr. of transactions annually. Leading customers such as Reliance Retail, Lifestyle, Yatra, Indigo, Inox, Tanishq, BPCL, WalMart are using these products. What makes us feel really proud is how cleverly we have used technology to make short\\-term credit available to more than 24,000 small businesses. Without technology, the challenges in supplying credit to this segment was not profitable for lenders and these businesses were unable to grow.
   

  

 If our track record is anything to go by, we have already made a small dent in the world of payments! We are now looking for enhancing our team with talented individuals who are ready to address more complex challenges and make a bigger dent!
