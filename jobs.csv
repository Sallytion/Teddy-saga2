**What We’re Building – And Why You Should Care**
 GDA is Maersk’s bold leap into the future of data and AI. It’s not just a platform\\-it’s a transformation of how the world’s largest integrated logistics company turns its operational data into strategic intelligence. Think: real\\-time insights on vessel ETA and carbon emissions, metadata\\-driven supply chain automation, and retrieval\\-augmented copilots that advise planners and operators. Our data engineers don’t just build pipelines\\-they shape the very foundation that powers AI\\-native logistics.
   

  

 As a data engineer in the GDA\\-FBM team, you’ll help modernize and operationalize Maersk’s global data estate. You’ll craft reusable, observable, and intelligent pipelines that enable ML, GenAI, and domain\\-specific data products across a multi\\-cloud environment. Your code won’t just move data\\-it’ll move trade.
   

  

**What You'll Be Doing**
* Ingest the world: Design and maintain ingestion frameworks for high\\-volume, structured and unstructured data\\-from operational systems, APIs, file drops, and events. Support streaming and batch use cases across latency windows.
* Transform at scale: Develop transformation logic using SQL, Python, Spark, and modern declarative tools like dbt or sqlmesh. You’ll handle deduplication, windowing, watermarking, late\\-arriving data, and more.
* Curate for trust: Collaborate with domain teams to annotate datasets with metadata, ownership, PII classification, and usage lineage. Enforce naming standards, partitioning schemes, and schema evolution policies.
* Optimize for the lakehouse: Work within a modern lakehouse architecture\\-leveraging Delta Lake, S3, Glue, and EMR\\-to ensure scalable performance and queryability across real\\-time and historical views.
* Strong expertise building data modelling and dimensional modelling. Experience in SSAS/AAS.
* Experience in Azure tech stack like ADF, ADB.
* Build for observability: Instrument your pipelines with quality checks, cost visibility, and lineage hooks. Integrate with OpenMetadata, Prometheus, or OpenLineage to ensure platform reliability and traceability.
* Enable production\\-readiness: Support deployment workflows via GitHub Actions, Terraform, and IaC patterns. Your code will be versioned, testable, and safe for multi\\-tenant deployments.
* Think platform\\-first: Everything you build should be reusable. You’ll help codify data engineering standards, create scaffolding for onboarding new datasets, and drive automation over repetition.


**What We’re Looking For**
* Strong foundation in data engineering: You know your way around distributed systems, columnar storage formats (Parquet, Avro), data lake performance tuning, and schema evolution.
* Hands\\-on cloud experience: You’ve worked with AWS\\-native services like Glue, EMR, Athena, Lambda, and object storage (S3\\). Bonus if you’ve used Databricks, Snowflake, or Trino.
* Modern engineering practices: Familiarity with GitOps, containerized workflows (Docker, K8s), and CI/CD pipelines for data workflows. Experience with Terraform and IaC is highly valued.
* Programming proficiency: Fluency in Python and SQL is a must. Bonus if you’ve worked with Scala, Jinja\\-templated SQL, or DSL\\-based modeling frameworks like dbt/sqlmesh.
* Curiosity and systems thinking: You understand the tradeoffs between batch vs streaming, structured vs unstructured, cost vs latency\\-and you ask why before you build.
* Collaboration skills: You’ll work closely with ML engineers, platform architects, security teams, and domain data owners. Ability to communicate clearly and write clean, documented code is key.


**What Makes This Role Special**
* Impact at global scale: Your work will influence container journeys, terminal operations, vessel routing, and sustainability metrics across 130\\+ countries and $4T\\+ in global trade.
* Platform\\-level thinking: You’re not just solving one use case\\-you’re building primitives for others to reuse. This is your chance to shape a high\\-leverage internal data platform.
* Freedom to experiment: We don’t believe in checkbox engineering. You’ll have space to challenge the status quo, propose better tooling, and refine the foundations of our platform stack.
* Career\\-defining scope: Greenfield. Executive visibility. Cross\\-domain exposure. This is not a maintenance role\\-it’s about creating the next chapter in Maersk’s data journey.


**If you’ve ever wanted to build a platform that moves not just data, but global trade\\-join us.**
 Maersk is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace, and we embrace different styles of thinking.
