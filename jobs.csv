* Partner with Product and Engineering teams to deliver new features at scale that directly impact customers’ ability to build, secure, and manage APIs.
* Participate in on\\-call rotations, owning services in production and driving reliability improvements.
* Write automated tests, observability hooks, and tooling to ensure reliability and reduce toil.
* Assist in the hiring process and help grow and mentor engineers on the team.
* Contribute to shaping the technical roadmap for Managed Gateways, bringing in ideas from infrastructure, networking, and platform engineering.
* Work in a high\\-velocity, pre\\-IPO environment, balancing innovation with reliability and customer impact.


**What You'll Bring**
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science or related field.
* 5\\+ years of experience building high\\-performance software, ideally in infrastructure or platform engineering.
* Strong experience with Golang
* Deep understanding of distributed systems, networking (L4/L7, DNS, TLS/SSL, HTTP), and cloud\\-native architectures.
* Hands\\-on experience with at least one major cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) and container orchestration (Kubernetes).
* Experience building APIs, standardizing APIs in large organizations, and creating API workflows.
* Experience designing and operating systems to deliver 99\\.99%\\+ uptime SLAs.
* Proven ability to debug complex systems from bit\\-and\\-bytes level (packets, protocols) to high\\-level design.
* Knowledge of observability and monitoring practices to ensure high availability and performance.
