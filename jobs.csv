I lead all things tech, platform, and cashflow here.
   

  

 I feel the Flent is a lot more than a grid of homes on an app. We are now building a platform for living.
   

  

 Renting in REAL life is extremely messy. Most people come with fuzzy requirements \\- “something close to my office, maybe ₹60k budget, should’ve good ventilation, non\\-smoking flatmates”. And on the supply side, every home is a new SKU with 100\\+ attributes. Traditional marketplace interfaces and journeys will never work.
   

  

 I think of our platform as a human broker in a software form \\- one that listens, interprets, and guides, rather than dumping endless choices. It should be able to explain
 ***“why this home”***
 makes sense for you, do the trade\\-offs you’d otherwise struggle with, and build trust through speed and clarity.
   

  

 Good software makes choices smooth. Great software makes them vanish into a flow – that’s the bar I hold while building things at Flent.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We’re hiring our foundation engineering squad — the team that’ll lay the technical bedrock of Flent.
   

  

 You’ll work with product and design to build Flent’s digital renting ecosystem. Whether it’s search, payments, or real\\-time notifications, your code will power how thousands of people find and manage their homes. We are looking for
 **AI\\-native engineers** 
 who can multiply output\\-scaffold, test, and refactor faster, while keeping quality and security high.
   

  

 More than anything, this is your chance to curate the kind of engineering culture you always wished for, built around people who care about doing their best work.
   

  

**What you’ll broadly do:**
* Architect the AI Broker You will own the strategic direction of our conversational search platform. Your goal is to move beyond filters, designing the core logic that understands renter intent and delivers curated, explainable home matches.
* Build Spatial Home Tours You will lead the creation of a new\\-to\\-market virtual tour experience. This involves architecting the spatial interface from the ground up, capturing user interaction data within the 3D space, and using those signals to create a smarter, self\\-improving discovery engine.
* Build the ""Flent for Living"" Platform You will be responsible for the entire resident\\-facing ecosystem. This includes the end\\-to\\-end development of features like integrated payments, smart access control, maintenance ticketing, and lifestyle service upgrades.
* Define Foundational Engineering Culture As a member of the founding engineering team, you will establish the technical standards, security practices, and development methodologies that will define how Flent builds products for years to come.


**What your day\\-to\\-day will look like:**
* Develop backend APIs and services (Node/TS, Go, Python, Postgres, Redis, GraphQL/gRPC)
* Build and optimize responsive UIs and 3D interactions (React/Next.js, WebGL, Three.js)
* Integrate and productionize AI/NLP modules and ML\\-driven recommendation systems
* Implement authentication, authorization, validation, monitoring, and logging
* Profile, debug, and optimize 3D rendering, database, and API performance
* Automate deployments, run tests, maintain CI/CD, manage feature flags
* Analyze metrics, design/run A/B tests, iterate on user feedback
* Review code, document technical decisions and run PR feedback rituals.


**We’re looking for someone who has:**
* Has 2–4 years of experience in software engineering, ideally across high\\-growth startups.
* Is a product\\-minded builder — raises the bar beyond functionality, prioritizing UX, performance, and clarity.
* fast adaptability — moves across backend, frontend, AI, and 3D; learns new tools quickly.
* Strong frontend chops: React/Next.js, modern state management, WebGL/Three.js for 3D, and performance budgets.
* Brings backend strength — comfortable with at least one of Node/TS, Go, or Python; Postgres; has some experience with Redis; queues/streams; caching; auth; rate\\-limiting; infra\\-as\\-code; and cloud (AWS/GCP).
* Is AI\\-native — uses copilots/agents for scaffolding, test writing, code search, and safe refactors — and knows when not to.
* Understands data \\& retrieval — familiar with embeddings/RAG, vector stores (pgvector/others), and building ranking/feedback loops.
* Practices strong engineering hygiene — testing strategy (unit/integration/property), static analysis, secure coding, privacy\\-aware logs, and clean rollbacks.
* Converts data to action — through clean event design, meaningful dashboards, disciplined A/Bs, and fast translation of signals into product updates.
* Operates with high agency and low ego — finds a way, moves fast, and keeps it real.
