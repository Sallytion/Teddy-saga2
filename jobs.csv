 **Agentic Modules** 
 — the atomic,
 **specification\\-driven building blocks** 
 of the Smarsh
 **Agentic Development Lifecycle (AI\\-SDLC)** 
 .
 



  





**A** 
 gentic Modules are AI\\-ready, self\\-contained bundles that encapsulate specifications, code, infrastructure, telemetry, and policy context to deliver product outcomes safely, predictably, and autonomously. Each module begins with a spec\\-driven contract — defining intent, inputs, expected outcomes, and governance rules — serving as the single source of truth between human developers, AI agents, and the Fabric platform.
 



  





 You will play a pivotal role in defining how these
 **executable specifications** 
 evolve from design artifacts into operational software, enabling a new model of collaborative product development where AI and humans co\\-create, validate, and ship features through structured automation.
 



 This role sits at the intersection of
 **AI enablement, platform engineering, and product development automation** 
 — shaping how Smarsh designs, builds, and governs software in an intelligent,
 **spec\\-first engineering ecosystem** 
 .
 



  





**What You’ll Do** 




**Build the Agentic CI/CD Module Platform** 



* Design and implement the Agentic Module architecture, enabling engineers and AI agents to define, execute, and audit engineering workflows as modular, spec\\-driven units.
* Build specification\\-driven pipelines that transform module specs into validated, executable artifacts — including build logic, policy enforcement, and telemetry binding.
* Develop reusable Agentic Module SDKs and templates for CI/CD, testing, refactoring, and compliance workflows.
* Ensure every module includes machine\\-readable specifications that define scope, dependencies, success criteria, and AI guidance.
* Contribute to the design of spec\\-to\\-execution frameworks that translate intent into code, infrastructure, and policy actions within the Smarsh Fabric.



  





**Embed Policy, Compliance, and Observability** 



* Integrate policy\\-as\\-code and governance hooks that enforce compliance and approvals directly from the specification layer.
* Implement telemetry emitters that provide full lifecycle visibility across build, deploy, and run stages of each Agentic Module.
* Define the observability schema that allows modules to self\\-report status, DORA metrics, ROI analytics, and AI participation telemetry.
* Ensure all execution is auditable, reversible, and explainable, supporting traceability across human and AI\\-driven actions.



**Engineer for AI Enablement and AI\\-DLC Integration** 



* Collaborate with AI platform teams to make Agentic Modules AI\\-executable — enabling agents to consume specifications, perform reasoning, and trigger compliant execution flows.
* Implement metadata and orchestration patterns that make specifications machine\\-interpretable and policy\\-aware.
* Design feedback loops where AI agents validate, improve, and extend specifications over time, accelerating the AI\\-DLC.
* Prototype spec evolution mechanisms where specifications adapt based on telemetry, performance data, and policy insights.



**Contribute to Platform Architecture** 



* Partner with Platform Engineering to embed Agentic Module orchestration into the Fabric runtime and AI\\-DLC pipelines.
* Develop integrations between the specification framework, CI/CD systems, IaC repositories, and AI validation engines.
* Influence architectural decisions to ensure every change — whether human or AI\\-initiated — flows through specification\\-driven governance and observability.
* Define patterns that make AI participation safe, explainable, and policy\\-bound across all stages of product delivery.



**Developer Experience \\& Enablement** 



* Build intuitive tooling for engineers to author, validate, and execute Agentic Module specifications.
* Deliver documentation, examples, and SDKs that empower developers to adopt spec\\-first, AI\\-assisted delivery patterns.
* Champion the developer experience — making the AI\\-DLC frictionless, observable, and auditable by design.
* Lead workshops, internal communities, and enablement efforts to drive adoption across Smarsh engineering teams.



  





**What You Bring** 




**Engineering Depth** 



* 5\\+ years of experience in software engineering, platform engineering.
* Strong programming skills in Python, Go, or TypeScript, with a focus on reusable frameworks and automation systems.
* Proficiency with Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD systems such as Argo, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
* Experience with policy\\-as\\-code (OPA) and compliance automation pipelines.
* Understanding of software supply chain security, auditability, and change governance in complex ecosystems.



**AI \\& Platform Awareness** 



* Familiarity with AI\\-assisted developer workflows, copilot systems, or agent orchestration frameworks.
* Experience designing systems that combine human intent with AI execution, using structured specifications as the interface.
* Understanding of AI context propagation, prompt scaffolding, and autonomous reasoning in software workflows.
* Knowledge of telemetry pipelines, Open Telemetry, and feedback loops between automation and insight.



**Architectural \\& System Thinking** 



* Proven ability to design modular, extensible systems that enable spec\\-to\\-execution automation.
* **Deep** 
**understanding of SDLC** 
 and
 **AI\\-SDLC convergence** 
 , including traceability, auditability, and compliance design patterns.
* Strong grasp of platform architecture, composable frameworks, and integration across CI/CD, IaC, and AI systems.
* Capable of thinking across data, process, and automation layers to create cohesive, scalable patterns.



**Collaboration \\& Communication** 



* Exceptional ability to collaborate across disciplines — AI, platform, product, and compliance.
* Clear technical communicator with a product mindset — able to bridge specification detail with outcome focus.
* Systems thinker who can articulate and evangelize spec\\-first engineering as the foundation for intelligent automation.



  





**Preferred Qualifications** 



* Prior experience in DevSecOps, platform enablement, or engineering systems architecture.
* Exposure to AI agent frameworks, LLM integration, or autonomous software delivery systems.
* Experience building self\\-service developer platforms and specification\\-driven automation systems.
* Familiarity with AI governance, policy observability, and AI validation frameworks.
* Contributions to open\\-source automation, observability, or AI orchestration projects.
