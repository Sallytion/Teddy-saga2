 Technology is accelerating. Systems are smarter, AI is everywhere... Yet the enterprise software we’re forced to use every day is stuck in the past.
 



  





 There is a fundamental disconnect with the way humans use software. Lots of decision points, pointless automations and agents built to help them and the UI which is impossible to navigate.
 



  





 At Calyb.ai, we are obsessed with closing this gap. We are chasing the ""delight"" that comes from the moment a user can simply do what they intend to do.
 



  





 We are building an intelligent, non\\-intrusive layer that understands a user's intent and empowers them to act on it, personally and immediately, on any software platform.
 



  





 To do this, we bring state\\-of\\-the\\-art ML, AI, and reinforcement learning to the table. But we are not just an AI company.
 **We are an engineering company first.** 
 We ground every system we build in the bedrock of classic software engineering. First\\-principles thinking is our core differentiator.
 



  





 We're building robust, scalable, and elegant systems designed for the long haul. That is Calyb.
 



  





  





**The Opportunity:** 




  





 This isn't just another senior engineering role. This is a chance to be a
 **founding member and technical cornerstone** 
 of our engineering team.
 



  





 We are hiring for your \\_engineering calibre\\_ and \\_systems\\-level thinking\\_, not for a specific framework. Whether your spike is in building elegant frontend experiences, architecting resilient backend systems, or both, if you love solving hard problems at scale, we want to talk to you. You will be instrumental in shaping the technical DNA of Calyb.ai, making architectural decisions that will define our platform for years to come. 
 



  





  





**What You’ll Do** 




  





 \\-
 **Architect \\& Build:** 
 Design, build, and own core components of the Calyb.ai platform, from our user\\-facing SDKs to our backend AI orchestration and data processing pipelines.
 



  





 \\-
 **Solve Foundational Problems:** 
 Tackle our most complex technical challenges. How do we build a real\\-time system that can scale to millions of user interactions? How do we design a multi\\-tenant architecture that is both secure and performant?
 



  





 \\-
 **Drive Technical Excellence** 
 : Set the bar for engineering at Calyb.ai. You will champion best practices in software design, code quality, and testing, shaping our engineering culture from day one.
 



  





 \\-
 **Own the Full Lifecycle:** 
 Take ambiguous, high\\-level ideas and own them from a whiteboard sketch through to deployment, monitoring, and iteration.
 



  





 \\-
 **Lead \\& Mentor:** 
 As a founding team member, you will be a key voice in our product and technical strategy and will help mentor and grow the team.
 



  





  





**This Role is for You If..** 




  





 \\-
 **You are a First\\-Principles Thinker** 
 : You have an exceptional grasp of computer science fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, databases, networking, distributed systems).
 



  





 \\-
 **You are a Systems Architect at Heart:** 
 You don't just write code; you design robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. You can instinctively reason about trade\\-offs between performance, cost, and reliability.
 



  





 \\-
 **You've Built for Scale:** 
 You have significant industry experience building and scaling complex, real\\-world applications. You have battle scars and stories to tell.
 



  





 \\-
 **You are a Versatile Problem\\-Solver** 
 : You might be a backend specialist, a frontend wizard, or a rare true generalist. Your core strength is your ability to pick up any tool, learn any system, and build a world\\-class solution.
 



  





 \\-
 **You Thrive in Ambiguity:** 
 You are a proactive self\\-starter who doesn't wait for instructions. You see a problem, outline a solution, and get it done.
 



  





 \\-
 **You Have a Bias for Action** 
 : You believe that ""done"" is better than ""perfect"" and have a proven ability to iterate quickly, test in the real world, and learn from your results.
 



  





  





**Bonus Points (Nice\\-to\\-Haves)** 




  





 \\-
 **Cloud Architecture** 
 : Deep expertise in designing, deploying, and managing scalable infrastructure on \\*\\*AWS\\*\\* or \\*\\*GCP\\*\\*.
 



  





 \\-
 **Experience tinkering with Agents:** 
 Past building experience and knows in and outs of building and working with AI Agents. How to break these, how to make them work...
 



  





 \\-
 **Database Mastery:** 
 Proven experience with \\*\\*large\\-scale database optimization\\*\\*, query tuning, and sharding strategies for both SQL and NoSQL.
 



  





 \\-
 **AI/ML Infrastructure** 
 : Hands\\-on experience with \\*\\*data pipelines\\*\\* (e.g., Kafka, Spark, Airflow) and familiarity with the modern ML stack, including \\*\\*Vector DBs\\*\\* (like Pinecone, Milvus) or model training workflows.
 



  





 \\-
 **Low\\-Level Performance** 
 : A strong understanding of operating systems, networking, and \\*\\*low\\-level optimization\\*\\* techniques to squeeze maximum performance out of systems.
 



  





 \\-
 **Modern Stack:** 
 Prior experience with application stack (e.g., Python, FastAPI, React, TypeScript) or similar modern technologies.
 



  





*To be clear: your core engineering principles are far more important to us than any specific technology on this list.* 




  





  





**Why Join Calyb.ai?** 




  





 \\-
 **Foundational Impact** 
 :You will build the core of our product and culture. Your work will matter every single day on production level for our customers. (not PoC or flashy demos)
 



  





 \\-
 **True Ownership** 
 : This is a partnership. You will receive
 **significant equity** 
 as a founding team member. 
 



  





 \\-
 **Complex Challenges** 
 : We are solving deeply interesting problems at the intersection of AI, HCI, and large\\-scale systems.
 



  





 \\-
 **Autonomy** 
 : You will have the freedom to make key decisions and the responsibility to see them through.
