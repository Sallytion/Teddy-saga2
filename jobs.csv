 is the new\\-age hardware lab for data infrastructure — powered by biomolecules (yes, actual DNA).
 





 We’re backed by
 
**1517** 

 (started by the founding directors of the Thiel Fellowship), Notion’s Akshay Kothari, Nikhil Kamath’s WTFund, Emergent Ventures, gradCapital, and the Sustainability Mafia. We’re building cutting\\-edge tools to take DNA data storage from lab to market. 
 





 Founded by
 
 Anagha Rajesh
 
 , a BITS Goa Chemistry grad with deep experience in scientific projects and venture building, we’re based in Bangalore.
 





 Our Pore\\-formance Lab (yes, that’s what we call it) is where electronics meets biology. We are looking for a hands\\-on Machine Learning Engineer excited to push single\\-molecule sensing and sequencing to the next level.
 




**What you will work on** 





 You’ll be working on solid\\-state nanopores, a tiny hole in thin membranes that can detect individual molecules as they pass through.
 





 Think: the world’s smallest sensors \\+ the coolest problem you’ll ever work on.
 





 Here’s what your day\\-to\\-day at BioCompute will look like:
 



* Analyze ionic current signals from electrochemistry experiments (don’t worry if you haven’t worked with electrochemistry before, as long as you are familiar with signal analysis)
* Design and train ML models (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, or whatever works best) to classify DNA modifications and other molecular features
* Collaborate with our electronic engineer
 


 to align models with physical measurements (you will also learn how the signals are actually generated).
* Visualize, debug, and optimize models to turn noisy currents into meaningful signals
* Help bring real\\-time ML inference into our nanopore readout hardware.



  





**What are the perks** 



* Work at the bleeding edge of interdisciplinary technologies, building a first\\-of\\-its\\-kind integrated storage hardware stack
* Freedom to experiment, fail and learn fast, and build cool things
* A healthy work culture that rewards curiosity and out of box thinking
* Compensation corresponding to industry standards, experience and technical acumen, with generous ESOPs



  





**Who are we looking for?** 



* A relentless builder who designs experiments to answer the questions that won’t stop bugging them, and isn’t afraid of failure
* A degree in Computer Engineering, Electronics Engineering or related fields (we are open to considering candidates without degrees in these fields if you have a strong proof of work)
* Experience with Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, and the usual suspects (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib). And experience doesn’t mean course work, but real projects.
* Hands\\-on experience building, training, and evaluating models (not just calling a library function)
* Curiosity about how molecules and electronics interact.
* A passion for building, breaking, fixing and learning.




 \\+1 (Bonus points) if you’ve ever:
 



* Worked with nanopores, biophysical data, or low\\-noise sensors (or COMSOL simulations of these)
* Built an end\\-to\\-end ML pipeline from raw signal to visualization.
* Tried explaining your work to friends and got blank stares (we feel you).




 \\* We are not concerned about where you went to college or what your CGPA is
 




  





**How to apply?** 





 Drop an email to
 
 hello@biocomputeinc.com
 
 with the subject line “BioCompute ML Engineer \\- \\[Your name]” and attach the below as attachment  or whatever way you like to do
 



1. A short note about your projects: what you built, why you built it, and what you learned (repos/demos welcome)
2. A \\~300\\-word summary of a research paper related to nanopore signal processing / event detection / ML for single\\-molecule analysis (this should be a standalone paper, not a review article)
3. A few honest lines about why this role excites you and why you want to work at BioCompute (please avoid college style essays)
