 ● Ensure robust observability (logging, metrics, tracing) and standardized runbooks for platform services.
 



 ● Establish best practices for environment management (dev/stage/prod), deployment strategies (blue/green, canary), and rollback safety.
 



  





 Developer Experience \\& Customer Focus
 



 ● Treat internal engineers as primary customers: regularly gather feedback, identify friction in the SDLC, and prioritize improvements that save developer time.
 



 ● Measure DevEx using clear metrics (e.g., lead time for change, deployment frequency, mean time to recovery, onboarding time) and drive continuous improvement.
 



 ● Partner with security, architecture, and product teams to align platform capabilities with compliance and business needs without slowing down delivery.
 



  





 Process \\& Execution

 Required Qualifications
 



 ● 8–12 years of industry experience building and operating cloud\\-based products or platforms.
 



 ● 2–4\\+ years of experience leading engineering teams (people management, not just tech lead), ideally in platform, DevOps, or Developer Experience domains.
 



 ● Strong hands\\-on background with modern DevOps practices: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure\\-as\\-code, container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) or serverless, cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), and observability stacks.
 



 ● Proven experience designing or evolving internal platforms/tools used by many product teams (e.g., deployment platforms, service templates, shared libraries, internal CLIs).
 



 ● Solid understanding of software engineering fundamentals (APIs, microservices, distributed systems, security basics) and ability to review designs and code at a high level.
 



 ● Demonstrated ability to set direction, manage stakeholders, and drive alignment across multiple teams and functions.
 



 ● Excellent communication skills, with the ability to translate technical trade\\-offs into clear options for engineering and business stakeholders.
 



  





 Nice\\-to\\-Have
 



 ● Experience in a Staff/Principal Engineer or Tech Lead role before moving into management.

 Why Join Us?
 



 ● Build and scale modern Dev Ex platforms from the ground up.
 



 ● Define the culture, processes, and growth path of the Dev Ex function.
 



 ● Work with cutting\\-edge technologies and best practices.
 



 ● Impact a rapidly growing organization by shaping infrastructure at scale.
