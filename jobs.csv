 **Computer Vision Specialist – Feature Detection \\& Real\\-Time Image Algorithms** 




 Full\\-Time \\| Core Team
 



 LAT Aerospace \\| Perception \\& Autonomy
 



  





 At LAT Aerospace, we’re building India’s first clean\\-sheet hybrid\\-electric STOL aircraft and a next\\-generation autonomy stack powering aircraft for complex missions. Our team is kicking off a new chapter — developing the full flight\\-control, obstacle\\-avoidance, GNSS\\-denied navigation, and swarm\\-coordination layers that will define LAT’s autonomy architecture.
 



 You will design and implement real\\-time CV algorithms for extracting features, tracking structure, and generating robust visual cues for localization, mapping, and inter\\-drone relative positioning. This role sits at the heart of our autonomy architecture.
 



  





**What you’ll do?** 



* Develop real\\-time computer vision algorithms using OpenCV and custom geometric vision pipelines for feature detection, feature tracking, keypoint extraction, and visual correspondence.
* Build robust visual processing modules for edge devices — capable of handling motion blur, lighting variation, small textures, low\\-altitude flight perspectives, and high\\-dynamic maneuvers.
* Extract structural cues (edges, corners, lines, descriptors) that drive VIO, SLAM, and GNSS\\-denied navigation pipelines.
* Implement multi\\-view geometric vision including epipolar geometry, homography estimation, essential matrix computation, and depth inference from motion.
* Optimize CV algorithms for embedded Linux systems and edge compute: SIMD, ARM optimizations, memory/latency efficiency.
* Develop visual debugging tools for inspection of keypoints, flow fields, descriptors, and algorithmic performance in real flight datasets.



  





**What we're looking for?** 



* Strong experience in classical computer vision, particularly feature detection, extraction, tracking, and geometric vision.
* Expertise with OpenCV, custom CV pipelines, and real\\-time image processing.
* Strong knowledge of epipolar geometry, camera models, triangulation, motion estimation, or similar domains.
* Strong Python and/or C\\+\\+ experience for vision algorithms.
* Experience optimizing algorithms on embedded hardware, GPUs, or constrained compute environments.
* Ability to evaluate algorithm robustness on real datasets and noisy field conditions.



  





**Why LAT?** 



* Core\\-team role building the autonomy brain of India’s most ambitious aerospace startup.
* Ownership, speed, and the opportunity to define a new class of systems from scratch.","Aviation and Aerospace Component Manufacturing","https://www.linkedin.com/company/lataerospace","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQHspa650_JnvQ/company-logo_100_100/B4DZp4DjNAKIAQ-/0/1762950789034/lataerospace_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=AzGjn92zppdOHvfGjXnAXCKbXcJecN5GaV2ZWt3bNT0","","","","","","","","","","",""
