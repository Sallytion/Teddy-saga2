You simply use the Amazon app to enter the store, take what you want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals, grocery essentials and merchandise, and go.
   

  

 Our checkout\\-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out (JWO) Technology. It automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a cart. When you’re done shopping, you just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. Designed and custom\\-built by Amazonians, our technology uses computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning. Innovation is part of our DNA. We need people who want to join a high\\-reaching program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.
   

  

 The Role: Everyone on our team needs to be entrepreneurial, wear many hats and work in a highly collaborative environment that’s more startup than big company. We’re solving problems that span a broad range of domains: computer vision, image recognition, machine learning, and distributed systems. This role involves building/scaling Machine Learning platform used for developing all the algorithms at JWO.
   

  

 As a Software Development Engineer, you will help solve a variety of technical challenges and mentor other engineers. You will play an active role in translating business and functional requirements into concrete deliverables and build quick prototypes or proofs of concept in partnership with other technology leaders within the team. You will help invent new features, design, develop and deploy reliable distributed services. You will work with a variety of core languages and technologies including Java, C\\+\\+, Linux.
   

  

 You will tackle challenging situations every day and you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems. Along the way, we guarantee that you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on many customers.
   

  

 The Role: You are a talented Software Engineer who knows how to design and code full\\-stack solutions. You know how to get things done, and done really well. You are a dreamer and a futurist. You have an inventor’s spirit, a can\\-do approach and proficiency in a wide range of design technologies, and a killer eye for detail. We are looking for talented engineers for Java and AWS services.
   

  

 In this role you’ll have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game\\-changing initiative. While you’ll be able to use existing Amazon systems when possible, you’ll be working on challenging problems that need creative solutions. You should be comfortable building prototypes, challenging assumptions, and thinking of creative ways to tackle challenges.

**Our Approach to Flexible Work**
 With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in\\-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in\\-office each week, we simply
 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
   

  

**Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!**
 At Workday, we value our candidates’ privacy and data security. Workday will never ask candidates to apply to jobs through websites that are not Workday Careers.
   

  

 Please be aware of sites that may ask for you to input your data in connection with a job posting that appears to be from Workday but is not.
   

  

 In addition, Workday will never ask candidates to pay a recruiting fee, or pay for consulting or coaching services, in order to apply for a job at Workday.
