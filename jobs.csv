 We are currently forming a lean founding team of exceptional engineers who will own core technical decisions and directly shape Kagaar’s product, systems, and long\\-term trajectory.
 



  





 This is not a conventional engineering role. As a Founding Software Development Engineer, you will operate as a true owner—driving critical technical decisions, building core product systems from the ground up, and partnering closely with leadership on execution and strategy.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 We are seeking an experienced Full Stack Engineer who has previously built and shipped products in SaaS\\-based startup environments. The ideal candidate has worked in high\\-ownership, venture\\-backed companies, understands early\\-stage ambiguity, and has demonstrated the ability to take products from concept to production.

**Key Responsibilities:** 



* Architect, design, develop, and deploy core full\\-stack features in a fast\\-paced startup environment.
* Build scalable, secure, and high\\-performance backend systems that can support rapid growth.

* Continuously evaluate and adopt modern development practices, tools, and frameworks where appropriate.



  





**Mandatory Requirements ( Non Negotiables ):** 




 Candidates must meet all of the following criteria to be considered:
 


* Minimum 3 years of professional experience as a Full Stack Engineer.
* Prior experience working at a SaaS\\-based startup, with direct involvement in building and shipping a real\\-world product.
* Experience at YC\\-backed companies or startups funded by top\\-tier venture capital firms (e.g., Y Combinator, Sequoia, a16z, Accel, Lightspeed, etc.).
* *This is a mandatory requirement.*
* Proven ability to work in early\\-stage environments with high ownership and minimal hand\\-holding.



  





**Technical Requirements:** 



* Strong proficiency in Next.js, React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Solid backend experience with Node.js and Express.js (Python or Java experience is a plus).
* Hands\\-on experience with databases such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.
* Strong system design fundamentals and problem\\-solving skills.
* Ability to independently drive execution in a fully remote setup.
* Clear, concise communication skills with a bias toward action.



*Educational background from institutions such as IITs, IIITs, BITS, VIT, or equivalent is preferred but not mandatory.* 




  





**Why Join Kagaar:** 



* Be part of the founding engineering team, influencing both product and company direction from day one.
* Work with high autonomy in a fast\\-moving, outcome\\-driven environment.
* Gain meaningful founding equity tied directly to your long\\-term impact and ownership.
* Collaborate within a transparent, learning\\-focused, and execution\\-oriented culture.



  





**Equity \\& Compensation:** 




 This is a strictly equity\\-only role. There is no fixed salary or cash compensation at this stage.
 



 Founding equity allocation will be determined based on:
 


* Depth and relevance of prior startup and SaaS experience.
* Technical leadership and execution capability.
* Long\\-term commitment and alignment with Kagaar’s vision.



 This structure reflects our belief in shared ownership and long\\-term value creation.
 



  





**Important Note:** 




 This role is intended only for candidates who fully understand and are genuinely prepared for the risks, responsibilities, and expectations of an early\\-stage, equity\\-only startup role.
 



 If you are not aligned with this model, we respectfully request that you do not apply.

* Email your resume and a brief cover letter to hireme@kagaar.in
