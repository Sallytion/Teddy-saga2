The team's main focus is on CIO use cases, while also supporting key workflows for Portfolio Managers. A major responsibility is end\\-to\\-end ownership of Reporting \\& Metering, with emphasis on creating a unified reporting platform for Buy\\-Side in collaboration with the Enterprise Product Platform team.
   

  

**Trading Connectivity \\& Liquidity (TCL) Configuration Infrastructure**

The team is currently redesigning securities financing workflows to enhance trade capture, lifecycle management, performance, and reliability, while delivering new features to meet evolving client needs.
