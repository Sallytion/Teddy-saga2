* Develop APIs, microservices, and backend logic for AI model interaction, integration, and real\\-time inference.
* Collaborate with DevOps, data, and infrastructure teams to deploy models in cloud, hybrid, or edge environments.
* Ensure code quality and maintainability using CI/CD, containerization, and version control.
* Optimize systems through profiling, parallelization, and hardware\\-aware deployment (e.g., GPUs, Jetson).
* Implement best practices for reproducibility, governance, and observability with tools like MLflow, Prometheus, and Grafana.
* Mentor junior engineers in backend and AI system design.


**Must\\-Have Skills** 
* Strong programming skills in
 **Python**

* In\\-depth understanding of AI system lifecycle — from data ingestion to monitoring.
* Proficiency with
 **Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines** 
 for ML system deployment.
* Knowledge of asynchronous processing, distributed systems, and real\\-time API design.
* Familiarity with model versioning/tracking tools like
 **MLflow, DVC, or Weights \\& Biases** 
 .
* Hands\\-on experience with Linux\\-based systems and containerized deployments.


**Nice to Have** 
* Exposure to computer vision (e.g., YOLO, UNet, Transformers).
* Experience with streaming inference systems (e.g., NVIDIA DeepStream, Kafka).
* Knowledge of edge AI hardware (Jetson, Coral) and optimization (ONNX, TensorRT).
* Familiarity with

 At Kyndryl, we design, build, manage and modernize the mission\\-critical technology systems that the world depends on every day. So why work at Kyndryl? We are always moving forward – always pushing ourselves to go further in our efforts to build a more equitable, inclusive world for our employees, our customers and our communities.
   

  

**The Role**
 Infrastructure Specialists at Kyndryl are project\\-based subject matter experts in all thing's infrastructure – good at providing analysis, documenting and diagraming work for hand\\-off, offering timely solutions, and generally “figuring it out.” This is a hands\\-on role where your feel for the interaction between a system and its environment will be invaluable to every one of your clients.
   

  

 The Specialists will develop a detailed migration strategy, including risk mitigation, pilot testing, and phased rollouts. They will provide architectural guidance to ensure secure and seamless migration of Power Platform solutions and related services. Additionally, the consultant will lead workshops with stakeholders to gather requirements and ensure alignment between business goals and technical solutions. development skills include developing and maintaining applications using Microsoft Power Apps, automating business processes and workflows using Microsoft Power Automate, and creating data visualization and reporting solutions using Power BI. They will collaborate with business stakeholders to gather requirements and deliver custom solutions, integrate Power Platform solutions with other Microsoft services and third\\-party applications, and ensure that solutions are scalable, maintainable, and secure.
   

  

 There are two halves to this role: First, contributing to current projects where you analyze problems and tech issues, offer solutions, and test, modify, automate, and integrate systems. And second, long\\-range strategic planning of IT infrastructure and operational execution. This role isn’t specific to any one platform, so you’ll need a good feel for all of them. And because of this, you’ll experience variety and growth at Kyndryl that you won’t find anywhere else.
   

  

 You’ll be involved early to offer solutions, help decide whether something can be done and identify the technical and timeline risks up front. This means dealing with both client expectations and internal challenges – in other words, there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference, and a lot of people will witness your contributions. In fact, a frequent sign of success for our Infrastructure Specialists is when clients come back to us and ask for the same person by name. That’s the kind of impact you can have!
   

  

 This is a project\\-based role where you’ll enjoy deep involvement throughout the lifespan of a project, as well as the chance to work closely with Architects, Technicians, and PMs. Whatever your current level of tech savvy or where you want your career to lead, you’ll find the right opportunities and a buddy to support your growth. Boredom? Trust us, that won’t be an issue.
   

  

 Your future at Kyndryl
   

  

 There are lots of opportunities to gain certification and qualifications on the job, and you’ll continuously grow as a Cloud Hyperscaler. Many of our Infrastructure Specialists are on a path toward becoming either an Architect or Distinguished Engineer, and there are opportunities at every skill level to grow in either of these directions.
   

  

**Who You Are**
 You’re good at what you do and possess the required experience to prove it. However, equally as important – you have a growth mindset; keen to drive your own personal and professional development. You are customer\\-focused – someone who prioritizes customer success in their work. And finally, you’re open and borderless – naturally inclusive in how you work with others.
   

  

**Required Technical And Professional Expertise**
* Minimum of 8\\+ years of experience in IT with strong understanding of the Power Platform, including Power Apps (both Canvas and Model\\-driven), Power Automate, and Power BI.
* Proficient in Programming Languages: C\\#, JavaScript, PowerShell, REST API
* Hands\\-on experience with SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, and other M365 services is essential.
* knowledgeable about tenant\\-to\\-tenant migration tools and techniques, such as Sharegate and Quest.
* Familiarity with Azure services like Logic Apps, Azure Functions, and API Management for Power Platform integrations is also required.
* proficiency in creating and managing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, environment strategies, and licensing considerations is crucial.
* Ability to analyses complex dependencies and inter\\-connectivity between M365 services during migration.
* Expertise in troubleshooting issues related to Power Platform applications and workflows post\\-migration.


**Preferred Technical And Professional Expertise**
* Microsoft Power Platform certifications (e.g., PL\\-400, PL\\-600\\).
* Microsoft 365 certifications (e.g., MS\\-100, MS\\-101\\).
* Experience with large\\-scale M365 tenant migrations and Power Platform optimization.
* Strong understanding of security and compliance requirements in the M365 ecosystem.
* Knowledge on JavaScript, PowerShell.
* Excellent communication skills for liaising with cross\\-functional teams and stakeholders.
* Ability to lead technical teams and mentor junior engineers.


**Being You**
 Diversity is a whole lot more than what we look like or where we come from, it’s how we think and who we are. We welcome people of all cultures, backgrounds, and experiences. But we’re not doing it single\\-handily: Our Kyndryl Inclusion Networks are only one of many ways we create a workplace where all Kyndryls can find and provide support and advice. This dedication to welcoming everyone into our company means that Kyndryl gives you – and everyone next to you – the ability to bring your whole self to work, individually and collectively, and support the activation of our equitable culture. That’s the Kyndryl Way.
