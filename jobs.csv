"li-4360804152","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4360804152","","Mechanical Engineer - Solutions","CynLr","Bengaluru, Karnataka, India","","fulltime","","","","","",False,"entry level","Engineering","","","**About CynLr** 




 Just like a baby’s brain, CynLr Visual Intelligence stack makes Robots to instinctively see \\& pick any object under any ambience, without any training. (a demo video link).
 



 Today, a robot that can fit a screw into a nut without slipping a thread, doesn’t exist. Imagine what it would take for a robot to assemble a Smartphone or a car by putting together 1000s of parts with varied shapes and weights, all in random orientations. Thus, factories become complex, needing heavy customization of their environment.
 



 CynLr\\-enabled visual robots
 *intuitively learn to handle even unknown objects, on\\-the\\-fly,* 
 eliminating the need for rigid fixtures, pre\\-training, or environment customization. This enables an universal alternative to custom automation thus simplifying factory lines into
 *modular LEGO\\-like micro\\-factories* 
 that can be rapidly reconfigured as products change.
 



 At the core of CynLr lies a fundamentally new approach to machine vision. Unlike conventional vision systems that rely on image recognition and heuristics, CynLr’ s Vision and ML stacks are
 *deeply inspired by neuroscience,* 
 modelling how biological vision understands shape, geometry, and interaction rather than appearance alone. To support this, CynLr builds its hardware, sensors, compute pipelines, and learning stacks from scratch, tightly coupling perception, decision\\-making, and action.
 



 This integration allows CynLr to operate in conditions that defeat traditional automation: variable lighting, cluttered environments, unknown objects, and high precision manipulation, unlocking automation use cases that have remained unsolved for decades. By rethinking vision as an intelligent, adaptive sense rather than a static tool, CynLr is redefining how robots perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world.
 



  





**About the Role** 




 This role focuses on
 **applying CynLr’s products to real\\-world customer and internal R\\&D use cases** 
 .
 



 You will work at the intersection of
 **product capability and customer reality** 
 , translating application needs, constraints, and workflows into
 **complete mechanical solutions** 
 . The work begins with a
 **deep understanding of customer problems** 
 , rather than jumping straight to parts or prototypes, and evolves into system\\-level designs that guide
 **integration, deployment, and iteration** 
 .
 



 Strong engineering here lives in the balance between
 **theory, system understanding, and hands\\-on reality** 
 . You will use first\\-principles thinking to frame application problems, identify constraints, and design
 **practical, testable solutions** 
 that work reliably in real customer environments.
 



 You will own the
 **entire solution lifecycle** 
 , from application definition and system architecture to mechanical design, integration, testing, and on\\-site refinement. The goal is not one\\-off demos, but
 **repeatable, deployable solutions** 
 that feed back into scalable and configurable product offerings.
 



 This role suits engineers who enjoy
 **system\\-level thinking** 
 , working
 **close to customers and hardware** 
 , and seeing solutions through to real\\-world deployment.
 



  





**What You Will Do** 



* Design
 **customer\\-facing applications and solutions** 
 , including:
* Visualising and modelling
 **product integration into real factory environments, machines, and workflows**
* Translating
 **abstract customer requirements and constraints** 
 into complete mechanical system architectures
* Designing
 **end\\-to\\-end mechanical solutions** 
 that account for installation, operation, and long\\-term use
* Support
 **integrator\\-driven deployment** 
 through:
* Mechanically customizable interfaces and mounting strategies
* Clear physical APIs, tolerances, and integration logic for repeatable field deployment
* On\\-site or near\\-field iteration, troubleshooting, and refinement
* Evolve solutions from:
* Custom, integrator\\-heavy deployments
* Configurable, teachable, and repeatable productized systems
* Collaborate closely with
 **product design, simulation, electronics, algorithms, manufacturing, and applications teams**
* Support validation, testing, and feedback from deployed systems



  





**What We Look For** 




 This role spans
 **end\\-to\\-end mechanical ownership of customer\\-facing solutions** 
 , without expecting universal expertise. We look for engineers with
 **deep, hands\\-on strength in designing and deploying real systems** 
 , supported by working knowledge across adjacent domains.
 



**Core Strengths** 



* Strong grounding in
 **mechanical fundamentals applied to real\\-world deployments**
* Deep expertise in one or more of:
* **Customer application and deployment engineering**
* **Special\\-purpose machine and station design**
* **Robotics application design and work cell integration**
* **End\\-of\\-arm tooling and gripper customisation**
* **Robotic system simulation for reach, cycle time, and risk**
* **Designing systems under installation, service, and uptime constraints**



**Mindset** 



* Hands\\-on experience with
 **factory, lab, or customer deployments**
* Ability to think in
 **workflows, use cases, and failure modes**
* Comfort with
 **incomplete requirements and evolving customer needs**
* Strong bias toward
 **documentation, validation, and repeatability**
* Ability to translate
 **application logic, algorithms, or control behaviour** 
 into mechanical architectures



**Tools** 



* Proficiency with
 **CAD drafting and 3D modelling tools** 
 (Fusion 360 preferred)
* Working familiarity with
 **robotics simulation and validation workflows**
* Exposure to
 **robot arms, grippers, sensors, motion components, wiring, and integration hardware**
* Experience with
 **scripting or automation tools** 
 is a plus



*Specific tools are not the primary filter. Sound engineering judgment and first\\-principles thinking matter more.* 




  





**Team Structure \\& Growth** 




 You will be part of a
 **multi\\-specialised mechanical team** 
 , working alongside
 **design engineers, simulation engineers, and general mechanical engineers** 
 .
 



 The role is
 **highly cross\\-functional** 
 , with close collaboration across
 **electronics, algorithms, software, manufacturing, and applications teams** 
 . Even as a solutions\\-focused engineer, your work remains tightly connected to
 **product design and long\\-term evolution** 
 .
 



 As CynLr grows, you will have opportunities to
 **own larger solution spaces** 
 , build deployment playbooks, mentor teams, or expand into
 **product architecture, operations, or customer applications leadership** 
 .
 



  





**Why This Role Matters** 




 Object manipulation has remained unsolved because
 **real\\-world applications refuse to behave like clean lab problems** 
 . This role exists to bridge that gap.
 



 Your work will turn cutting\\-edge capability into
 **systems that actually work on factory floors** 
 , and in the process, redefine what
 **mechanical solutions engineering** 
 means in robotics.

"li-4331992649","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4331992649","","Embedded System - FPGA & SoC Performance Engineer","CynLr","Bengaluru, Karnataka, India","","fulltime","","","","","",False,"mid-senior level","Engineering and Information Technology","","","**About CynLr** 




 Just like a baby’s brain, CynLr Visual Intelligence stack makes Robots to instinctively see \\& pick any object under any ambience, without any training. (a demo video link).
 



 Today, a robot that can fit a screw into a nut without slipping a thread, doesn’t exist. Imagine what it would take for a robot to assemble a Smartphone or a car by putting together 1000s of parts with varied shapes and weights, all in random orientations. Thus, factories become complex, needing heavy customization of their environment.
 



 CynLr\\-enabled visual robots
 *intuitively learn to handle even unknown objects, on\\-the\\-fly,* 
 eliminating the need for rigid fixtures, pre\\-training, or environment customization. This enables an universal alternative to custom automation thus simplifying factory lines into
 *modular LEGO\\-like micro\\-factories* 
 that can be rapidly reconfigured as products change.
 



 At the core of CynLr lies a fundamentally new approach to machine vision. Unlike conventional vision systems that rely on image recognition and heuristics, CynLr’ s Vision and ML stacks are
 *deeply inspired by neuroscience,* 
 modelling how biological vision understands shape, geometry, and interaction rather than appearance alone. To support this, CynLr builds its hardware, sensors, compute pipelines, and learning stacks from scratch, tightly coupling perception, decision\\-making, and action.
 



 This integration allows CynLr to operate in conditions that defeat traditional automation: variable lighting, cluttered environments, unknown objects, and high precision manipulation, unlocking automation use cases that have remained unsolved for decades. By rethinking vision as an intelligent, adaptive sense rather than a static tool, CynLr is redefining how robots perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world.
 



  





**About the Role:** 




 Product Design begins as a hypothetical concept. Transforming that concept into a functional Product is a highly creative and experimental process that requires a strong understanding of system\\-level fundamentals and application\\-driven trade\\-offs.
 



 In FPGA\\-based embedded systems, the utility and limitations of a product are defined by how effectively the FPGA platform is configured, integrated, and used at the system and application level. Performance, latency, determinism, and I/O capability depend on IP selection, configuration, firmware integration, and system architecture.
 



 You will be responsible for the application\\-level design, integration, validation, and deployment of FPGA\\-based embedded systems. The Product Design team will be your internal customer.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities:** 



* Supporting CynLr’s Product Design team with all FPGA application and system\\-level activities.
* FPGA platform configuration and integration using vendor\\-provided IP cores and reference designs.
* System bring\\-up, validation, and debugging of FPGA\\-based hardware platforms.
* Verification \\& Validation (V\\&V)
* Defining test procedures for FPGA\\-based systems and firmware
* Executing tests and validating manufactured PCBs and assemblies
* Interfacing with vendors (FPGA vendors, IP providers, PCB manufacturers, component suppliers, simulation and service providers) to plan and coordinate successful project execution.
* Acting as the FPGA application and system knowledge base for design engineers and freshers joining the organization.



  





**Team Structure \\& Career Path:** 




 This role resides in the Electronics team and is part of the larger hardware team. The role has touchpoints with other teams most notably the Product Design team. We are a startup and there is a tremendous potential to build your own team or grow into a principal engineer role over time in the space or expand into other areas.
 



  





**Job Requirements** 




 Below are some key requirements. We expect working knowledge in most areas and deep hands\\-on expertise in either FPGA or SoC
 



**A. Electronics \\& System Fundamentals:** 



* Strong understanding of digital electronics and system\\-level architecture.
* Solid understanding of register\\-based systems and memory architectures (DDR, SRAM, Flash).
* Working knowledge of power distribution and sequencing for FPGA\\-based systems.
* Understanding of processor and accelerator architectures (ARM\\-based SoC FPGAs).



**B. FPGA Application \\& Platform Development:** 



* Hands\\-on experience with FPGA or SoC\\-FPGA.
* Strong familiarity with FPGA vendor toolchains (Vivado, Quartus, Libero).
* Experience configuring and integrating:
* Vendor\\-provided IP cores
* Memory controllers
* Communication and data\\-movement IP Blocks
* Ability to generate FPGA bitstreams using existing IP and reference designs.



**C. Embedded Firmware Design \\& Development:** 



* Strong experience in embedded firmware development using C/C\\+\\+.
* Experience developing firmware for ARM cores inside FPGA SoCs
* Experience with bare\\-metal or RTOS\\-based systems.
* Ability to develop and debug drivers for memory\\-mapped peripherals.
* Good understanding of boot flows, BSPs, and build systems.



**D. Interfaces \\& Communication:** 



* Strong working knowledge of communication protocols:
* UART, SPI, I2C, AXI
* Ethernet, USB
* Experience debugging data flow, latency, and performance issues at the system level.



**E. Verification and Validation:** 



* Adept in using JTAG\\-based debugging tools.
* Experience with system bring\\-up and validation of FPGA\\-based boards.
* Experience using:
* Logic analyzers
* Oscilloscopes
* Vendor\\-provided tools (Vivado, Quartus, Libero)
* Ability to create and execute test procedures and validation plans.
* Ability to debug data flow and performance bottlenecks at the system level.



**F. Behavioural Tendency:** 




 Critical Thinking, Available, Responsible, Versatile, Resourceful, Thorough, Attention to Details \\& “Humble”.
 



  





**What Will You Do:** 




 CynLr’ s vision system is central in the control loop of the vision guided manipulation platform. The stereo vision system is acquiring at 75 FPS and this means processing must also happen at this speed or higher and the processing method based on neural network is computationally intensive as it involves a high level of successive matrix multiplication. For this the processing is split between multiple processing units FPGA, GPU and CPU based on the type of processing that is required. Your focus will be majorly on the FPGA, working closely with the Product Design team to build and deploy FPGA\\-based embedded systems at the application and system level. This includes configuring FPGA platforms using vendor tools and IP, developing embedded firmware to control and interface with FPGA logic, bringing up and validating hardware, and debugging system\\-level issues involving interfaces, memory, and peripherals. You will define and execute verification and validation procedures, support prototypes and manufacturing builds, and ensure reliable system behaviour in real\\-world use. This role focuses on integration, firmware, and system validation
 



  





**How Will You Do:** 




 Though confined to a focused area, the work is pretty much expected to be entrepreneurial with the exact advantages and difficulties of a startup. Since this is a startup and the product will evolve at a rapid pace, the contours of the technology, toolchain \\& Process will have to constantly adapt to the changes. You will participate in actively contributing in building the process \\& tool chain too. You will have complete freedom here, but you will be subjected to reviews.

**About CynLr \\& Role** 




 Just like a baby’s brain,
 
 CynLr
 
 Visual Intelligence stack makes Robots to
 
 instinctively see \\& pick any object under any ambience, without any training
 
 . (
 
 a demo video link
 
 ).
 



  





 Today, a robot that can fit a screw into a nut without slipping a thread, doesnt exist. Imagine what it would take for a robot to
 
 assemble a Smartphone
 
 or a car by putting together 1000s of parts with varied shapes and weights, all in random orientations. Thus factories become complex, needing heavy customization of their environment.
 



  





 CynLr enabled visual robots intuitively learns to handles even unknown objects, on\\-the\\-fly – eliminating the need for customization and an universal alternative to custom machines. Simplifying factory lines into modular LEGO blocks of micro\\-factories.
 



  





 CynLr's Vision \\& ML stacks are largely Neuroscience inspired and builds its HW, Sensors \\& ML blocks from scratch.
 



  





**As a GPU developer, you will be responsible for building and translating the Visual Pathway of the Brain \\& assist in Building ML\\&RL learning models that are performance\\-optimized GPU code block and build mathematical models that are better represented in GPU.** 




  





**Key Responsibilities:** 



* Translating the Neuroscience models from Brain, identified \\& designed by the Algo team into Bio mimicking GPU codes.
* Designing and optimising foundational neural networks and modelling neurons (basically optimizing mathematical models that involve time\\-weighted kernels) ground up.
* Optimizing Time Continuous kernels \\- not just High\\-Level Kernel optimizations that are shipped with CUDA.
* Design the framework of Pipelined Image processing \\& identify the performance bottlenecks in Image processing Pipeline.
* CUDA core optimization to achieve maximum performance for a pipelined processing between multiple blocks of functions executing simultaneously.
* Dynamic Load balancing between kernels and functions.
* Interleaving processing between CPU and GPU and runtime modification of GPU processing control flow from CPU.
* Build with NvidiaDirect to access memory directly from Peripheral devices (PCIe), Display and USB, bypassing the CPU for acquiring images from Camera Hardware.
* Construct Direct Visualization of GPU Memory for Debugging without CPU transfer.



  





**Team Structure:** 




 The engineering team will comprise of – Algo Team, GPU Team, SW Dev Team \\& HW Team. Members of other teams will be passive members of each team apart from the team they lead. The Algo Team will research on Neuroscience and provide the Neural Models \\& Vision algorithms, while the GPU Team will provide the GPU optimizations for the algos, HW team will provide the HW integration and SW team with translate GPU optimized algos into SW blocks. Each team will split the implementation among other teams and guide them through the implementation. Every team member will be a passive member of all other teams.
 



  





**Requirements in Practice** 
 :
 


* Experienced with Low\\-level CUDA API
* Strong with fundamentals of C\\+\\+/C.
* Adept with Visual Studio developer toolchain.
* Experience in low\\-level performance analysis and optimization with a strong understanding of the GPU HW architecture and HW\\-oriented performance optimization.
* including proficiency using GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Visual Profiler, NVIDIA Nsight Compute and Graphics Developer tools for debugging
* Exposure to Omniverse is a Plus



  





**Must have an understanding of :** 



* GPU\\-based application development. Knowledge of
 **CUDA** 
*(Excellency is not necessary)*
* State machine architecture
* Realtime computing
* Memory architectures and optimizations.
* MIMD, SIMD



  





**Good to have experience and practice with** 



* Compiler working and construction.
* CPU architectures – x86, x64 \\& ARM
* Hardware\\-associated driver development.
* OS and layers (Board Support Packages, BIOS, UEFI, BootLoader)
* UI\\-based deployable application development



  





**What will you do?** 




 Simplistically put – you will think all the algorithms that the Neuroscience team comes up with through GPU for maximum performance. You will break down the entire pipeline of processing that imitates the visual pathway into optimized blocks and kernels of processing in GPU. You will meticulously discover the mathematical models that gives the maximum timing performance for every Neural Model/algorithm that the Vision and Neuro team comes up with.
 



 You will also be building some aspects of Debugging, profiling and Image visualizing tools for GPU.
 



  





**How will you Do?** 




 Though confined to a focused area, the work is pretty much expected to be entrepreneurial with the exact advantages and difficulties of a startup. Since this is a startup and the product will evolve at a rapid pace, the contours of the technology, toolchain \\& Process will have to constantly adapt to the changes. You will participate in actively contributing in building the process \\& tool chain too. You will have complete freedom here, but you will be subjected to reviews.
 



***For Senior roles:***




 Part of your design effort involves requirements discovery and developing architectures that are agnostic to requirement changes. The SW part of the product significantly evolves as per your thought process and will henceforth carry your signature in it.
 



 You will also be building a team as the product evolves to maintain and develop further.

***About Radix:***




*REVOLUTIONISING THE INTERNET:* 




 We started out in 2012 as a part of the Bhavin Turakhia led Directi Group, which has been a prominent player in the web presence industry since the 90s. The meteoric rise in the number of websites back then led to an acute shortage of quality domain names. The depleting name pool within the .com / .net led to growing customer dissatisfaction as first choice names became impossible to find! We knew that domain names had to evolve in order to serve their purpose of memorable online identities.
 



**Enter Radix.** 




 When the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) opened the door to new top level domains other than the .com, .net, .org etc., we knew it was the perfect opportunity to solve a growing customer problem.
 



 Equipped with powerful and meaningful new extensions such as .tech, .online, .store, .fun, .site, .press etc. we set out on a mission to eliminate the distinction between the real names and internet addresses of individuals and businesses. We started with an audacious goal of building a world where domain names are less like phone numbers which need to be written and stored and more like brand names which are easily remembered. And here we are, with more than 11 million domains already registered on our extensions, we are well on the path towards revolutionizing the internet. Brands like Mr. Beast (www.mrbeast.store), Viacom (www.viacom.tech), Emirates (emirates.store), Doordash (order.online), CES (ces.tech), Shakira (www.shakira.store) and many more have already made the switch. Its only a matter of time before the rest of the world does it too. To sum it up, the internet history is being rewritten and Radix is at the core of it.
