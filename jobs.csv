 The security team at Meesho is like the Avengers to Meesho's S.H.I.E.L.D. After all, when 5% of Indian households shop with us, it’s important to build resilient systems to manage millions of orders every day. We’ve done this – with zero downtime! 😎 Sounds impossible? Well, that’s the kind of Engineering muscle that has helped Meesho become the e\\-commerce giant it is today. We value speed over perfection, and see failures as opportunities to become better. We’ve taken steps to inculcate a strong ‘Founder’s Mindset’ across our engineering teams, making us grow and move fast. We place special emphasis on the continuous growth of each team member \\- and we do this with regular 1\\-1s and open communication.
   

  

 As a Security Engineer, you will be part of self\\-starters who thrive on teamwork and constructive feedback. We know how to party as hard as we work! If we aren’t building unparalleled tech solutions, you can find us debating the plot points of our favorite books and games – or even gossipping over chai. So, if a day filled with building impactful solutions with a fun team sounds appealing to you, join us.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As a Software Security Engineer, you’ll design, build, and scale internal security automation and tooling that safeguard Meesho’s products and infrastructure.
