 **deep\\-tech robotics product company** 
 building
 **complete robotic systems** 
 — from
 **mechanical design and actuators to low\\-level hardware control and high\\-level software** 
 .
 



 We design and manufacture
 **affordable 6\\-DOF industrial robotic arms** 
 for Indian SMEs, targeting applications such as
 **welding, pick\\-and\\-place, powder coating, inspection, and deflashing** 
 .
 



 Our stack is built primarily on
 **ROS 2 Humble** 
 , with in\\-house development of motion control, planning, and system integration.
 



 We are looking for engineers who
 **understand robots as physical systems** 
 , not just simulation.
 


 Job Overview
 
 We are hiring a
 **ROS 2 C\\+\\+ Developer** 
 with
 **strong hands\\-on experience in MoveIt2** 
 and a solid understanding of
 **robot kinematics and motion planning** 
 .
 



 Experience working on
 **real robotic hardware** 
 is a
 **strong plus** 
 , but candidates with serious MoveIt2 \\+ kinematics experience are also encouraged to apply.
 



 This role involves
 **developing, deploying, debugging, and optimizing 6\\-DOF robotic arms** 
 in real industrial environments.
 


 Key Responsibilities
 * Develop and maintain
 **ROS 2 (Humble or later) C\\+\\+ nodes** 
 for robot control and motion execution
* Work extensively with
 **MoveIt2** 
 for:
* Motion planning
* Inverse \\& forward kinematics
* Trajectory generation and execution
* Collision checking and scene setup
* Understand and work with
 **6\\-DOF robot kinematics** 
 , including:
* Joint space vs Cartesian space
* Tool frames, base frames, and world frames
* 3D coordinate systems and transformations
* Support
 **robot calibration** 
 (TCP, base, tool, frame alignment)
* Integrate software with
 **real robotic hardware** 
 (drivers, controllers, sensors)
* Debug real\\-time issues related to motion accuracy, vibration, trajectory smoothness, and execution failures
* Deploy robotic systems at
 **customer sites** 
 and support on\\-site testing
* Collaborate closely with
 **mechanical, electrical, and controls teams**


 Requirements
 
 ✔
 **2\\+ years of strong C\\+\\+ experience** 
 (mandatory)
 



 ✔
 **Hands\\-on experience with ROS 2 (Humble or later)** 




 ✔
 **Practical experience working with MoveIt2** 




 ✔ Clear understanding of:
 


* Robot kinematics (FK, IK)
* 3D coordinate systems (X, Y, Z, rotations)
* Frames, transforms, and calibration concepts
* ✔ Experience with trajectory execution and tuning motion behavior
* ✔ Comfortable working with
 **real robots** 
 , not just simulation
* ✔ Willingness to work on\\-site and travel for deployments when required","Research","https://in.linkedin.com/company/nextup-robotics","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQHb80ipLMgSUQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1693974707000/nextup_robotics_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=TjWSGE56Q18HNE4giTNZMXecDR1B-G8ijsWR0fD5KCo","","","","","","","","","","",""
