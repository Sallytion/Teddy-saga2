These services have cross cutting concerns that 100s of fellow engineers use as the building blocks at Cloudflare. The team also writes services that are redundant for each product development team to build and that serve high volumes of requests every day.
   

  

 As an engineer in the Engineering Productivity and Platforms organization, you'll be building and managing tools to help engineers deploy and operate the services that make Cloudflare work. Our mission is to provide a reliable, yet flexible, platform to help product teams release new software efficiently and safely.

* Help respond and prevent incidents impacting core platforms.
* Harden the platform against security threats and resource contention issues.
* Improve our GitOps systems and practices.
* Work with app teams to understand their potential challenges and help them choose the best way to architect their systems.


**Desirable Skills, Knowledge And Experience.**
* Ability to work with codebases in Bash, TypeScript and Go.
* Excellent debugging skills.
* Source control experience including branching, merging and rebasing.
* The ability to break down complex problems into smaller pieces, provide options, talk through trade\\-offs and drive the effort to solve the problem.

**Project Galileo** 
 : Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers\\-\\-at no cost.
   

  

**Athenian Project** 
 : In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.
   

  

**1\\.1\\.1\\.1** 
 : We released 1\\.1\\.1\\.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy\\-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use \\- it is the first consumer\\-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal \\- we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

**The Partner Services Team**
 Within the Consumer Authentication Business Unit, the Partner Services team helps to grow and expand our business by designing, building and supporting integrations between HID Consumer Authentication Products and third\\-party strategic ecosystems (Technology Partners).

**What You'll Do**
* Own services end‑to‑end: Design and ship multi‑tenant services (checkout, payments orchestration, subscriptions, settlement \\& reconciliation, invoicing, tax hooks).
* Integrate payments at depth: Add PSPs and local methods (cards/3DS, UPI, wallets, BNPL) with resilient webhooks and strictly idempotent APIs.
* Model money correctly: Implement an append‑only double‑entry ledger; use event sourcing/CQRS where it meaningfully improves correctness and scale.
* Raise the quality bar: Ship production‑grade code with contract, integration, property‑based, and performance tests; instrument everything with OpenTelemetry.
* Run it like you own it: Operate on GKE (GCP) with CI/CD, canaries, autoscaling, SLIs/SLOs, incident response, and on‑call participation.
* Collaborate \\& mentor: Partner closely with PM/Design and mentor SDE I/II engineers to multiply team impact.


**What You'll Lead**
* Cross‑service designs that connect orchestration → ledger → reconciliation with clear contracts and failure‑mode analysis.
* Reliability strategy: Define SLIs/SLOs, capacity models, and multi‑region failover plans; drive DR and chaos drills.
* Data lifecycle: Establish data retention/archival strategies compliant with regulatory requirements.
* Engineering excellence: Level‑up design reviews, postmortems, and technical strategy across the Payments \\& Commerce domain.


**Minimum Qualifications**
* 3–6\\+ years building backend services, with strong TypeScript/ Node.js and NestJS experience.
* Practical expertise with MongoDB and/or Firestore (transactions, indexing), plus cache design with Redis and event‑driven architecture (Kafka, GCP Pub/Sub).
* Strong grasp of distributed systems fundamentals: idempotency, retries/backoff \\& jitter, message ordering, de‑dup/outbox for “exactly‑once‑ish” processing, race conditions, concurrency control, and eventual consistency.
* Hands‑on with Kubernetes and at least one cloud (GCP preferred); familiarity with secrets/KMS and PCI basics.
* Deep testing discipline: unit, integration, contract, and performance testing.
* Schema design: Design and plan schemas with a focus on scalability and backward compatibility.
* Strong problem‑solving and debugging skills.


**Nice to have**
* Frontend: Vue 3 \\+ Vite.
* Data \\& analytics: BigQuery, Dataflow/Beam, Snowflake.
* Multi‑region design: Experience with latency budgets and consistency trade‑offs.
* Observability at scale and hands‑on chaos/DR practice.
* Prior experience at a fintech, payment processor, or e‑commerce company.


**What Success Looks Like (first 6–12 Months)**
* You own 1–2 services from design → production with P99 latency targets met and zero Sev‑1s caused by your changes.
* Failure retry rates drop by \\>30% through improved idempotency and retry/backoff policy.
* Codebases are measurably cleaner (coverage up, linting strict, typed contracts) and you actively mentor 2\\+ engineers.
* You define or sharpen SLIs/SLOs, capacity models, a multi‑region failover plan, and data retention/archival standards for your area.
