**What You’ll Do** 



* Fast learning: We often require learning new tools and technologies. We believe in adopting them if they are particularly well suited for our problems, instead of limiting ourselves to what we already know. However, we are always short of time and therefore have to learn fast.
* Versatility: While each one of us has a core skill, we possess at least one secondary skill as well. Apart from allowing the team to be fluid, it also helps us understand how all pieces (frontend, database, network, servers, etc.) fit together.
* Madness about quality: Put together, individual lines of code should be robust, scalable, high\\-performance, fault\\-tolerant, and most importantly, beautiful software. We also stay up\\-to\\-date with the latest in the world of software to make ourselves better.
* Passion: To try out new ideas and iterate on existing product features, and love experimenting with new technology if it's right for the job. Because not only do we ride the cutting edge, we make it happen.
* Collaboration: We believe that engineering is a continuous process of learning and improvement and that the best way to learn is by getting help from your fellow engineers. Coding is more fun when you do it together and appreciate the feedback.
  

  



**What We’re Looking For** 



* Work as a part of QA team and take ownership of the Quality of Web and Mobile Apps.
* Able to lead and take ownership of QA processes within a scrum team.
   

 Work closely with the development team to define robust testing processes through manual testing.
* Monitor and track the resolution of quality issues.
   

 What makes you a great fit: 4\\-6 years of professional software testing experience
* Experience in writing clear, concise and comprehensive test plans and test cases
* Hands\\-on experience with both white box and black box testing
* Strong knowledge of software QA methodologies, tools, and processes
* Problem\\-solving skills, analytical mind, and positive attitude
* Experience in the backend, database, non\\-functional and mobile apps testing

 A PhD position is available at the Department of Technology and Safety (ITS), Faculty of Science and Technology with the research group Advanced Maritime Ship Operations.
   

  

 ITS is organised under the Faculty of Science and Technology and is located at three campuses: Tromsø, Bardufoss and Harstad. The department has approximately 90 employees and approximately 600 students. It offers undergraduate, master’s, and PhD degree programmes as well as research in the areas of nautical science, aviation, societal safety, environment, and international preparedness.
   

  

 The position is for a period of three years. The objective of the position is to complete research training to the level of a doctoral degree. Admission to the PhD programme is a prerequisite for employment, and the programme period starts on commencement of the position.
   

  

 The workplace is at UiT in Tromsø. You must be able to start in the position within a reasonable time after receiving the offer.
   

  

 The position’s field of research
   

  

 Digital twin technology for ocean\\-going vessels is key to meeting the decarbonization goals set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The Advanced Maritime Ship Operations research group is dedicated to developing and showcasing digital twin models for selected vessels through extensive ship performance and navigation data. The position is funded by the TwinShip Horizon Europe Project (Twin\\-Ship.eu), where UiT is the project coordinator.
   

  

**TwinShip Project**
 The TwinShip consortium is spearheading an initiative to transform the maritime sector by creating an alliance of premier maritime technology, solution \\& service providers, ship design and shipping firms, classification societies, ports, software developers, and research and academic bodies. This collaboration is centered around a unique, open\\-source digital platform enriched with data and powered by domain knowledge\\-based advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. By introducing a Digital Twin (DT) enabled Decision Support System (DSS) in the same digital platform, TwinShip is setting a course for the maritime industry's rapid digital and environmental transformation. The project sets ambitious benchmarks for reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions in international shipping, aiming for a 30\\-40% reduction by 2030, 80\\-90% by 2040, and achieving net\\-zero emissions by 2045, all relative to 2008 levels by utilizing its Pilot Vessels and Futuristic Unmanned Vessel Concept. This initiative focuses on leveraging both existing and emergent clean fuels and technologies, prioritizing renewable energy sources, and the implementation of unmanned vessels. The TwinShip DT\\-enabled DSS is crafted to navigate the industry toward achieving these significant environmental targets, demonstrating the consortium's dedication to fostering sustainability and pushing the boundaries of innovation.
   

  

 UiT\\- The Arctic University of Norway will lead this largest European\\-level project on maritime digitalization supported by machine learning and AI applications toward achieving zero emission vessels under this initiative. The project consortium consists of SINTEF Digital, SINTEF Ocean, Wärtsilä\\-Finland, Wärtsilä\\-Voyage Germany, Wärtsilä\\-Voyage doo Beograd, Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, National Technical University of Athens, American Bureau of Shipping, Grimaldi Group, Stena Line, Stena AB\\-Teknik, KNUD E. HANSEN, Fundación Valenciaport, ASSIST Software, UBITECH, 52°North GmbH – and bound4blue.
   

  

 The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) based Knowledge Graphs, associated with Ontologies, for digital twin development of ocean\\-going vessels, is the main objective of this position. The knowledge graphs will be developed by utilizing ship performance navigation domain knowledge through LLMs and data sets from selected vessels, on the VesselAI digital platform that has been developed under the VesselAI H2020 project (vessel\\-ai.eu). The same digital platform will adopted for the TwinShip Horizon Europe project, where one version of the Advanced VesselAI platform will be established at UiT. It is expected that the PhD candidate will implement the LLMs to develop Knowledge Graphs on the same platform to support extended digital twin development for the maritime industry.
   

  

**The Objective Of The Ph.D. Position Is To Develop**
* Large Language Models to support Knowledge Graphs for selected vessels and ship systems.
* Knowledge Graphs based on engine propeller combinator diagrams of the same vessels.
* Machine learning algorithms for data clustering and regressions of ship performance and navigation data sets as a part of digital twin development.
* Quantification of ship performance by digital twin applications in shipping.
