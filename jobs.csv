 Partnr Network is on its way to becoming the Talent Layer for Borderless Societies. Shh! That’s all we can say right now.
 



 We’re in the early\\-growth stage, moving fast, and building things that matter. You’ll be working directly with the founding team — not buried under managers. Every line of code you write, every idea you test, will have a real impact on the business.
 



 This role is not for someone looking for a quiet routine. It’s for someone who thrives on adaptability, curiosity, and ownership.
 



  





**What You’ll Do** 




 We won’t give you a dull corporate checklist, but expect to:
 


* Prototype, build, test, and ship features quickly
* Think about how data should be structured, write the business logic, design the UI, and connect it all
* Design and run real AI\\-powered workflows (not toy demos)
* Balance moving fast with writing clean code, following naming conventions, and respecting patterns that keep things maintainable
* Break things (in dev), learn from it, and make them stronger
* Carry real responsibility — what you do here will shape the product and the company



  





**Our Toolbox (for now)** 



* Languages/Frameworks: Python, TypeScript, React, Next.js
* Databases: SQL \\+ graph\\-based
* AI/ML: LangChain, agent frameworks, transformers, NLP, vector databases, AI monitoring
* Infra \\& Tools: AWS, Git, Apache JMeter



  




* **Extra kudos if you’ve:**
* Built dashboards that made messy data actually useful
* Worked at a startup before, especially taking apps from zero → live users → scaling pains
* Experimented with blockchains, load monitoring, or telemetry
* Broken things just to see how they work (in safe environments, of course :) )



  





**Who You Are** 



* Strong fundamentals. Will we ask you DSA in interviews? Maybe, maybe not. Consider it Schrödinger’s requirement.
* 0\\-2 years of experience working in related roles.
* You can move fast, but not leave chaos behind. Test\\-driven development, clean code, and naming discipline matter to you.
* You’re a curious generalist, willing to cross domains instead of sticking to one box.
* You’re comfortable using AI tools, but skeptical enough to know when not to.
* You can unlearn yesterday’s tool and pick up tomorrow’s without flinching.
* You know that with great power comes great responsibility — and you want both.



  





**Why Join Us** 




 \\* Work directly with the founders, real exposure, real stakes
 



 \\* Not corporate, no red tape, no silos
 



 \\* Growth across domains, frontend, backend, infra, AI, testing, security
 



 \\* Massive impact, what you build here won’t be side projects, it will shape our future
