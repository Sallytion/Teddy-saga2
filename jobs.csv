 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea.

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

 You’ll join as one of the first engineers, work directly with the CTO, and do what senior engineers rarely get to do in big teams: turn clear product direction into shipped production features at high speed. You’ll work across Python/FastAPI, React, Postgres, Azure, Docker, and async systems to build an enterprise AI platform with live customers. This is a high\\-ownership, low\\-process environment for engineers who value execution, judgment, and real impact. Bangalore\\-based role with regular in\\-person collaboration.
 




  





**Role Overview** 



* Location: Bangalore
* Team: One of the first 2–3 engineers
* Reports to: CTO
* Customers: Enterprise



  





**About PANTA** 





 PANTA builds enterprise AI systems that integrate into real production workflows, particularly in creative and publishing domains. We already have customers live and are in an active build\\-and\\-ship phase.
 




  





**The Role** 





 Work directly with the CTO as part of the founding engineering team. You will design, build, and ship production features end to end with a high degree of ownership and autonomy. This role is for engineers who want impact, speed, and accountability—not narrow scope.
 




  





**Responsibilities** 



* Ship end\\-to\\-end features used by enterprise customers
* Work across the stack: Python/FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Azure, Docker, GitHub
* Build integrations with AI platforms (Gemini, Azure OpenAI)
* Make pragmatic engineering decisions that balance speed and quality
* Own the reliability and correctness of what you ship



  





**What Success Looks Like** 



* You ship independently and consistently
* You require minimal context to be effective
* You remove execution bottlenecks
* The product moves faster because you are here



  





**What We’re Looking For** 



* 4\\+ years building and shipping production full\\-stack software
* Strong backend fundamentals and practical frontend ability
* Sound engineering judgment, high ownership, and execution speed
* Comfortable in early\\-stage, low\\-process environments



  






 We don’t hire for syntax memorization or framework loyalty. We hire engineers who can reason about systems and deliver outcomes. We actively use AI\\-assisted development tools (e.g. Claude, Gemini) to increase leverage—but you are expected to understand, review, and fully own the code that runs in production.
