 As the future becomes agentic, our customers need us now more than ever. AI has opened the door to extraordinary possibilities—but inside the enterprise, things are moving fast and feeling chaotic. Some early adopters are making progress in production, but for many, AI tools are sprawling without governance, data isn’t ready, and talent isn’t there yet. Enterprises are still drowning in application backlogs and struggling with legacy systems. But with the right platform, AI doesn’t have to add to the chaos. It can become the breakthrough that brings clarity—and drives real, enterprise\\-wide impact.

 dbt Labs is the pioneer of analytics engineering, helping data teams transform raw data into reliable, actionable insights. Since 2016, we’ve grown from an open source project into the leading analytics engineering platform, now used by over 50,000 teams every week.
   

  

 As of February 2025, we’ve surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and serve more than 5,400 dbt Cloud customers, including JetBlue, HubSpot, Vodafone New Zealand, and Dunelm. We’re backed by top\\-tier investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Altimeter. At our core, we believe in empowering data practitioners:
   

  

* Code\\-based data transformations unlock transparency, flexibility, and collaboration
* Analysts should adopt software engineering best practices to build trusted data products
* Core analytics infrastructure should be open source and user\\-controlled
* Analytic code—not just tools—should be shared and community\\-driven


 dbt is now synonymous with analytics engineering, defining the modern data stack and serving as the data control plane for enterprise teams around the world. And we’re just getting started. We’re growing fast and building a team of passionate, curious people across the globe. Learn more about what makes us special by checking out our values.
   

  

 The Mission: Why This Role Exists
   

  

 dbt Labs is scaling its semantic connectivity footprint, moving deeper into engine\\-native compute integrations, ADBC interoperability, and Rust\\-based execution layers.
   

  

 To accelerate adapter maturity, reliability, and ecosystem reach, we need senior builders who can ship platform primitives, mentor contributors, and harden dbt Fusion’s foundations.
   

  

**About The Team**
 dbt Fusion is building the next generation of data execution and connectivity infrastructure, enabling dbt workloads to run efficiently across diverse compute engines and data platforms. As a Senior Engineer on the Fusion Adapters and Connectivity team, you’ll design and ship core abstractions powering how dbt communicates with execution systems — leveraging Rust, Go, Arrow, and emerging open standards. This is a rare opportunity to work at the intersection of systems programming, database internals, and high\\-visibility open\\-source development. Your work will shape a foundational platform leveraged across the dbt ecosystem and the broader data community.
   

  

**In this role, you can expect to:**
* Design, build, and maintain Rust\\-first connectivity layers, execution APIs, and adapter scaffolding.
* Partner with teams building the dbt compiler, semantic layer, and runtime to evolve adapter interfaces and system boundaries.
* Contribute to Arrow/ADBC and other open\\-source specifications or implementations, strengthening the data ecosystem.
* Own CI, testing frameworks, profiling, error reporting surfaces, and release readiness for Fusion adapters.
* Debug complex interoperability and performance issues across drivers, engines, and compute domains.
