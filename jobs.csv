* Ensure the team builds the “right thing” (value) and builds it “the right way” (quality, security, reliability).
* AI quality, evaluation, and safety gates
* Define AI acceptance criteria: accuracy/quality metrics, evaluation approach, test datasets, and human\\-in\\-the\\-loop needs where required.
* Suggest guardrails for safe usage: prompt/tool policies, data access controls, logging/traceability, and responsible AI checks.
* Ensure reproducibility and versioning across data, prompts/configs, and model components.
* Production readiness and operational excellence
* Drive go\\-live readiness across observability, performance, cost controls, rollback strategy, SLAs/SLOs, and incident response.
* Partner with platform/infra teams for deployment, networking, identity/SSO integration, secrets management, and environment hardening.

* Stakeholder management and executive communication
* Act as the single accountable owner for status, trade\\-offs, and decisions—communicating clearly to technical and business leaders.
* Produce crisp executive updates: progress, risks, mitigations, decisions needed, and next milestones.
* Align multiple stakeholders across regions/time zones and keep teams moving despite ambiguity.

 This isn’t just “testing.” It’s ensuring WrkTalk meets the gold standard in reliability, performance, and security before it ever reaches a client.
 



  





**Who are we?** 




  





 We are a young product company scaling fast and outgrowing the startup tag—with global scale in our crosshairs. We don’t do “okay.” We give everything we’ve got to build the best communication platform in the world.

 WrkTalk is the world's first zero\\-access, zero\\-spam enterprise communication product that operates on a structural privacy architecture. One that’s already earned the trust of large enterprises like L\\&T Finance, Adani Group, and Kalyan Jewellers – just to name a few of our enterprise clients. This is not an MVP. This is production\\-grade software that secures communication for thousands—and soon, millions—of professionals worldwide.

* Collaborate with engineers to ensure issues are identified, documented, and resolved quickly.
* Contribute to automation scripts for recurring tests.
* Ensure product security and compliance checks are validated before release.



  





**The tech here is serious.** 




 We work on socket\\-driven comms infrastructure, distributed control towers, multi\\-category encryption, root detection, app kill\\-switches, dynamic guest access, device\\-level lockout, and OOO/ DND logic layered with smart whitelisting. This is not lightweight app dev. This is protocol\\-layer decision\\-making.

* Experience in JavaScript ,TypeScript, or Java for Automation testing.
* Experience with Load testing/ Stress testing with tools like JMeter, Artillary is a plus



  





**Why should you join?** 




  




* Because you want to set the standards of testing that will ensure global quality
* Because you’ll work directly with established founders, not buried under layers
* Because you’ll ship real, deeply engineered features used by large number of enterprise users
* Because you’ll grow 10x faster here—in experience, learning, and impact
* And because if you walk this road with us for 3–4 years, it’ll catapult you into a tech orbit or fame and glory you never imagined
