 Meion builds AI agents that sit on top of existing business systems and workflows to automate high\\-friction, manual operations. We work primarily with SMBs and mid\\-market companies, helping them save time and cost without forcing them to rip and replace their current tools.
 



 Our approach is pragmatic: identify repetitive operational work, apply AI only where it creates clear value, and ship solutions that deliver measurable outcomes. We are an early\\-stage company focused on execution, speed, and real customer impact.
 



  




 Role Description
 
 We are looking for a
 **Founding Engineer** 
 to help build Meion from the ground up. This is a hands\\-on, high\\-ownership role where you will design, build, and deploy AI\\-powered automation solutions end\\-to\\-end.
 



 You will work closely with the founder on product direction, technical architecture, and early customer implementations. This role is ideal for someone who enjoys ambiguity, moves fast, and wants to shape both the product and the company from day one.
 



 This is a
 **remote role** 
 , open to candidates based in India.
 



  




 What You’ll Do
 * Design and build AI agents that integrate with real\\-world business systems (CRMs, ERPs, support tools, internal dashboards, APIs, etc.)
* Own features end\\-to\\-end: from problem understanding and architecture to implementation and deployment
* Work directly with early customers to understand workflows and translate them into reliable automation
* Make foundational technical decisions around stack, architecture, and scalability
* Rapidly prototype, ship, and iterate based on real usage and feedback
* Balance speed with pragmatism — shipping working solutions over perfect abstractions



  




 What We’re Looking For
 * Strong experience as a backend or full\\-stack engineer (startup or early\\-stage experience is a big plus)
* Comfortable working with APIs, integrations, and distributed systems
* Experience building with or around AI/LLMs (prompting, orchestration, tooling, not just calling an API)
* Ability to work independently and make technical decisions with minimal guidance
* Product\\-minded: you think in terms of user workflows and business outcomes, not just code
* Comfortable with ambiguity and early\\-stage constraints



  




 Nice to Have
 * Experience building automation, internal tools, or workflow systems
* Familiarity with cloud infrastructure and deployment (AWS, GCP, Vercel, etc.)
* Prior founding, early\\-employee, or consulting experience



  




 Compensation \\& Structure
 * **Project\\-based compensation** 
 (paid per engagement or milestone)
* **Meaningful equity** 
 as an early founding team member
* Opportunity to transition into a long\\-term core engineering role as the company scales



  




 Why Join Meion
