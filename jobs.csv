 Experience : 5–8 years
   

  

**About The Role**
 We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer who blends strong technical ability with a product mindset. You’ll be a core contributor in an empowered team — working alongside product and design to define problems, ship features, and measure impact.
   

  

 This role is for someone who writes clean, maintainable code, thinks deeply about user outcomes, and wants to help shape not just how we build, but what we build.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Build and ship features end\\-to\\-end: From design to deployment using Angular, TypeScript, and AWS Lambda.
* Collaborate across disciplines: Work with product, design, and peers to translate ideas into measurable results.
* Own your code: Write scalable, testable, and observable software with a focus on long\\-term maintainability.
* Apply product thinking: Understand user problems, question assumptions, and propose better solutions.
* Champion feature flagging and experimentation: Use tools like GrowthBook or LaunchDarkly for safe, data\\-driven rollouts.
* Contribute to engineering excellence: Participate in code reviews, improve CI/CD pipelines, and share best practices.
* Mentor junior developers: Help raise the bar for technical quality and craftsmanship across the team.


**What You Bring**
* 5–8 years of professional software engineering experience.
* Excellent English communication skills — both written and verbal.
* Deep hands\\-on experience with Angular (v13\\+), TypeScript, HTML/CSS, and RxJS.
* Working knowledge of Java (Spring Boot) or Node.js services.
* Mandatory: Proven experience deploying and maintaining serverless apps on AWS Lambda.
* Familiarity with feature flags, A/B testing, and progressive delivery.
* Understanding of REST / GraphQL APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and modern SDLC practices.
* Curiosity, initiative, and a bias toward ownership — you don’t wait to be told what to build next.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience with GrowthBook, LaunchDarkly, or Split.io.
* Familiarity with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar CI/CD tools.
* Knowledge of Cloudflare Workers, AWS Step Functions, or serverless orchestration patterns.
* Experience optimizing Angular app performance at scale.
* Exposure to analytics instrumentation and product telemetry.
* Comfort working in distributed, async\\-first teams.


**How We Work**
 We believe in empowered product teams — engineers, designers, and PMs working together to solve meaningful problems. You’ll have autonomy to explore ideas, mastery to grow your craft, and purpose in seeing real user impact.
