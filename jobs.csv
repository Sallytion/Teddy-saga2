**JOB DESCRIPTION**
 What is IAM at OCI?
   

  

 OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows users to control who has access to their cloud resources. As part of the Cloud Platform organization, the team is responsible for the design and build of core services that are utilized by internal and external customers alike.
   

  

 The Identity Availability and Platform Engineering team is primarily responsible for delivering availability and Platform solutions for tier 0 OCI IAM service in Oracle cloud. Team is delivering Disaster Recovery solutions and manage Platform services like cloud native Infrastructure, Caching, Jobs infrastructure and Metering
   

  

 Who are we looking for?
   

  

 We are looking for engineers with distributed systems experience. You should have experience with the design of major features and launching them into production. You’ve operated high\\-scale services and understand how to make them more resilient. You work on most projects and tasks independently.
   

  

 The ideal candidate will be technically strong and get a lot done – you’ve worked on services that are highly available, scalable, and redundant. You understand that simple systems are easier to operate and troubleshoot. You can balance speed and quality with iteration and incremental improvements. You’ve made life easier for other developers and have motivated your teams to make both process and service improvements with your ability to automate and instrument properly to get the right data. You understand operational excellence and how to instill a culture of being proactive with your teammates. You find anomalies in graphs that didn’t trip any alarms and root cause problems before they become real problems.
   

  

 The person in this role will get a lot done on a daily basis, drive tactical execution of features and projects, and own feature design.
   

  

 What are the biggest challenges for the team?
   

  

 The biggest challenges for the team are reliability and performance. The growth of the business is driving us to improve the ability of our systems to scale out and handle traffic patterns that are several orders of magnitude greater than what we can support today.
   

  

 We understand that software is living and needs investment. The challenge is making the right tradeoffs, communicating those decisions effectively, and crisp execution.
   

  

 We need engineers who can build services that handle millions of requests per second. We need engineers who can figure out how we can survive regional data center outages and protect our customers. We need engineers who can build services that enable us to offer even more options to customers and contribute to the overall growth of Oracle Cloud.
