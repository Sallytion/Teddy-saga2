**About the Role:** 




 We're looking for a Senior Full\\-Stack Developer who doesn’t just write code—but builds systems, owns features end\\-to\\-end, and leverages AI tools to move fast and build smart. This isn’t a ticket\\-taking role. This is for builders who can architect, develop, and ship independently, with a bias toward action and clarity. If you live inside your terminal, talk to Co\\-pilots like your pair programmer, and obsess over clean APIs and smooth user flows—let’s talk.
 



  





  





**Responsibilities:** 



* Take full ownership of features from problem → design → code → deploy → iterate
* Build modular, scalable APIs and frontend components using the MERN stack
* Use AI tools to write, debug, optimize code, and unblock yourself fast
* Integrate 3rd\\-party APIs, services, and AI capabilities where relevant
* Collaborate async with product, design, and other engineers
* Optimize performance, scalability, and dev workflows
* Own dev hygiene—documentation, tests, Git practices, CI/CD pipelines



  





  





**Qualifications:** 



* Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related technical field
* **5 years of full\\-stack experience in production\\-grade MERN apps**
* You’ve shipped products end\\-to\\-end, not just maintained features
* Strong in JavaScript/TypeScript, both on frontend and backend
* Solid foundation in system design, API design, and debugging
* Comfortable using AI\\-native tools to code faster and better
* GitHub is your second home. You write clean commits and structured PRs
* Cloud/infra experience (Vercel, AWS, Docker/Kubernetes)



  





  





**Required Skills:** 



* Experience in HR or Ed Tech
* Experience in assessment platforms
* Experience with SSR (Next.js), GraphQL, WebSockets, or Firebase
* Familiarity with AI API integration (OpenAI, Pinecone, LangChain, etc.)
* Open\\-source contributions, side projects, or an active GitHub



  





  





**Preferred Skills:** 



* High ownership and autonomy
* Access to all AI tools needed to move fast
* Impactful work: ship fast, see real users benefit
* No unnecessary meetings or busywork — just focused execution and meaningful collaboration.

 🚀 About Nova
 





 Nova is not another swipe\\-and\\-ghost dating app. We’re reimagining dating for Gen Z and Millennials in India — built around emotional connection, consent visibility, and intelligent matchmaking.
 





 Our vision is to build a conversation\\-first platform that promotes intentionality, emotional safety, and real compatibility using AI\\-driven insights and behavioral analysis.
 




  






 🧩 Role Overview
 





 We’re looking for a backend engineer who loves building clean, scalable APIs, but also has curiosity (and basic competence) around natural language processing and intelligent systems.
 





 You’ll work closely with our mobile dev and product team to build Nova’s core engine — from chat infrastructure to our AI\\-based compatibility layer and behavioral safety signals.
 




  






 🔧 What You'll Do
 



* Build and maintain scalable APIs using FastAPI
* Design relational schemas using PostgreSQL for users, matches, profiles, and chat
* Implement and optimize real\\-time chat systems (using WebSockets or Firebase)
* Integrate LLMs via APIs (OpenAI, Claude, Cohere) to extract emotional \\& safety insights from chats
* Build and iterate text classification pipelines (toxicity detection, vibe scoring, ghosting patterns)
* Implement work/profile verification systems (e.g., email OTPs, LinkedIn screenshot check)
* Collaborate on matchmaking logic, including Operation Manmadha (our AI\\-enhanced compatibility algorithm)
* Build admin/moderation tools for trust, safety, and manual interventions




 🛠️ Skills \\& Experience✅ Required
 



* 6\\+ years of backend development experience (preferably with Python \\& FastAPI)
* Deep understanding of REST API design, auth (JWT), and async architecture
* Experience with PostgreSQL and Redis (or similar cache systems)
* Familiarity with WebSockets or other real\\-time communication protocols
* Exposure to OpenAI/Cohere APIs or similar — able to build LLM\\-based pipelines
* Comfortable with prompt engineering, LLM outputs, and chaining logic
* Experience writing modular, testable code and working in CI/CD environments




 🔍 Nice\\-to\\-Have
 



* Experience with Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, scikit\\-learn, or PyTorch
* Exposure to chat risk classifiers, toxicity detection, or sentiment analysis
* Understanding of Gale\\-Shapley algorithm or other matchmaking logic
* Knowledge of Firebase for presence/chat or file storage
* Prior work in dating apps, mental health, or trust/safety tech




 💡 Traits We’re Looking For
 



* You think like a product builder, not just an API writer
* You’re excited about LLMs, user trust, and emotional tech
* You write code that’s easy to read, easy to test, and easy to scale
* You’re proactive — suggesting improvements and not waiting for specs
* You care about making online dating safer, healthier, and more human




 📦 What We Offer
 



* Chance to build India’s most thoughtful dating platform
* Work with a small, ambitious founding team with design, product, and film experience
* Freedom to experiment with cutting\\-edge AI
* A strong culture of autonomy, empathy, and no bullshit
* Competitive pay \\+ equity (for long\\-term hires)




 📬 How to Apply
