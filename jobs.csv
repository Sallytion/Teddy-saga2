 As part of the AWS Applied AI Solutions organization, we have a vision to provide business applications, leveraging Amazon’s unique experience and expertise, that are used by millions of companies worldwide to manage day\\-to\\-day operations. We will accomplish this by accelerating our customers’ businesses through delivery of intuitive and differentiated technology solutions that solve enduring business challenges. We blend vision with curiosity and Amazon’s real\\-world experience to build opinionated, turnkey solutions. Where customers prefer to buy over build, we become their trusted partner with solutions that are no\\-brainers to buy and easy to use.
   

  

 The Team: From the merchandise stores at Sports venues to small\\-format stores such as Amazon Go, a new kind of technology is powering stores with no lines and no checkout. You simply use the Amazon app to enter the store, take what you want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals, grocery essentials and merchandise, and go.
   

  

 Our checkout\\-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out (JWO) Technology. It automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a cart. When you’re done shopping, you just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. Designed and custom\\-built by Amazonians, our technology uses computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning. Innovation is part of our DNA. We need people who want to join a high\\-reaching program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.
   

  

 The Role: Everyone on our team needs to be entrepreneurial, wear many hats and work in a highly collaborative environment that’s more startup than big company. We’re solving problems that span a broad range of domains: computer vision, image recognition, machine learning, and distributed systems. This role involves building/scaling Machine Learning platform used for developing all the algorithms at JWO.
   

  

 As a Software Development Engineer, you will help solve a variety of technical challenges and mentor other engineers. You will play an active role in translating business and functional requirements into concrete deliverables and build quick prototypes or proofs of concept in partnership with other technology leaders within the team. You will help invent new features, design, develop and deploy reliable distributed services. You will work with a variety of core languages and technologies including Java, C\\+\\+, Linux.
   

  

 You will tackle challenging situations every day and you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems. Along the way, we guarantee that you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on many customers.
   

  

 The Role: You are a talented Software Engineer who knows how to design and code full\\-stack solutions. You know how to get things done, and done really well. You are a dreamer and a futurist. You have an inventor’s spirit, a can\\-do approach and proficiency in a wide range of design technologies, and a killer eye for detail. We are looking for talented engineers for Java and AWS services.
   

  

 In this role you’ll have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game\\-changing initiative. While you’ll be able to use existing Amazon systems when possible, you’ll be working on challenging problems that need creative solutions. You should be comfortable building prototypes, challenging assumptions, and thinking of creative ways to tackle challenges.

 engineering role where you’ll design the architecture for the platform, optimize local
   

  

 deployments, and build seamless interfaces for chip engineers to interact with intelligent
   

  

 design agents. You’ll shape the developer experience end\\-to\\-end, from indexing massive
   

  

 codebases to building scalable databases, and make critical technical decisions that
   

  

 define the product. Expect to ship fast, iterate daily, and leave your fingerprints on every
   

  

 layer of a system, redefining how hardware gets built.
   

  

 What We’d Like to See
   

  

 Core Skills
   

  

* Deep proficiency in TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, Rust, C, and C\\+\\+.
* Strong end\\-to\\-end full\\-stack engineering experience — you can move fluidly


 between frontend, backend, and infrastructure.
   

  

* Expertise in modern frameworks such as React.js, Next.js, and state management


 tools (Zustand, Redux, Recoil, etc.).
   

  

* Proven record of personal or open\\-source projects, AI\\-based systems, or technically


 complex builds that show strong initiative.
   

  

* Excellent fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and systems design.


 Education
   

  

* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a


 related field from a Tier\\-1 institution (IITs, IIITs, BITS Pilani, NIT Trichy/Surathkal/
   

  

 Warangal, etc.).
   

  

* Strong academic and research orientation is a plus.


 Technical Experience
   

  

* Deep experience designing RESTful APIs and working with relational or NoSQL


 databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
   

  

* Strong understanding of frontend component design, UI performance, and


 developer experience.
   

  

* Proven ability to ship features fast, iterate rapidly, and maintain production\\-grade


 quality.
   

  

* Experience building or integrating developer tools, AI coding agents, or internal dev


 platforms is a strong plus.
   

  

 Systems Knowledge
   

  

* Fluency with Linux, Docker, virtual environments, and Git.
* Experience setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins,


 etc.).
   

  

* Familiarity with cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure) and Kubernetes.


 Collaboration \\& Time Zone
   

  

* You’ll work remotely from India but collaborate daily with the Palo Alto team.
* Must have excellent written and spoken English communication, clear, concise, and


 proactive.
   

  

* Expect regular standups and sprint syncs with California (typically between 8–11 PM


 IST / 7–10 AM PST).
   

  

* We value responsiveness, initiative, and a sense of ownership that transcends time


 zones.
   

  

 Bonus
   

  

* Previous experience at AI developer tool companies, IDE extensions, or AI coding


 assistants (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.).
   

  

* Founding engineer or early\\-stage startup experience. You thrive in fast\\-moving,


 high\\-responsibility environments.
   

  

* Ex\\-Quant, competitive programmer, or medals in IMO/IOI/IPho, or published


 research in AI or systems.
   

  

* Exposure to compiler pipelines, LLM tooling, or AI infrastructure is highly desirable.
* Deep hunger to learn, build, and grow beyond your comfort zone.


 We’re especially interested in engineers with experience at world\\-class product or infra
   

  

 teams such as Postman, Razorpay, Zerodha, Hasura, Glean, Atlan, DevRev, Zepto,
   

  

 Mistral, Hugging Face, Nvidia, Amazon, or Microsoft, or those who have built and shipped
   

  

 complex systems independently.

 engineering role where you’ll design the architecture for the platform, optimize local
   

  

 deployments, and build seamless interfaces for chip engineers to interact with intelligent
   

  

 design agents. You’ll shape the developer experience end\\-to\\-end, from indexing massive
   

  

 codebases to building scalable databases, and make critical technical decisions that

 complex builds that show strong initiative.
   

  

* Excellent fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and systems design.


 Education
   

  

* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a


 related field from a Tier\\-1 institution (IITs, IIITs, BITS Pilani, NIT Trichy/Surathkal/
   

  

 Warangal, etc.).
   

  

* Strong academic and research orientation is a plus.


 Technical Experience
   

  

* Deep experience designing RESTful APIs and working with relational or NoSQL


 databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
   

  

* Strong understanding of frontend component design, UI performance, and


 developer experience.
   

  

* Proven ability to ship features fast, iterate rapidly, and maintain production\\-grade


 quality.

 platforms is a strong plus.
   

  

 Systems Knowledge
