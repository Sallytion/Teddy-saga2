****About The Role****
 We are looking for a
 **Platform Engineer** 
 to design and build the internal foundation that powers our development lifecycle. Your goal is to eliminate friction for our engineering teams by building a self\\-service ""Internal Developer Platform."" You won't just manage cloud environments; you will treat the infrastructure as a product, creating automated workflows and abstractions that allow our developers to deploy, scale, and manage their own services with high confidence and zero ""ticket\\-waiting.""
   

  

****What You’ll Do****
* Build the ""Golden Path"": Design and maintain internal developer tools and self\\-service portals that abstract away the complexity of AWS, allowing developers to provision resources independently.
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Leadership: Lead the transition toward modular, reusable IaC (Terraform/Pulumi) modules that other teams can consume as a service.
* CI/CD Evolution: Architect robust, high\\-speed delivery pipelines that integrate automated security scanning, testing, and blue/green deployment patterns.

* 4–6 years of experience in Platform Engineering, DevOps, or Site Reliability, with a clear focus on building internal tooling.
* Cloud Architecture Mastery: Deep expertise in AWS services (Lambda, RDS, S3, Step Functions, VPC networking) and how to stitch them together securely.
* Advanced IaC: Proficient in writing modular, dry, and testable Terraform or CloudFormation at scale.
* Developer Mindset: You write clean code (Python, Go, or Bash) and approach infrastructure with the same rigor as product software (version control, PRs, testing).
* Strategic Thinker: You can identify repetitive developer ""pain points"" and design automated solutions to solve them permanently.


****Experience We’d Be Particularly Excited About****
* Platform\\-as\\-a\\-Product: Experience treating internal tools as a product (gathering requirements from devs, documentation, and driving adoption).
* FinOps \\& Scaling: Proven track record of optimizing large\\-scale cloud spend without sacrificing performance.
* Security Integration: Experience implementing ""Shift Left"" security (e.g., Snyk, Trivy) within the developer workflow.
* Interest in ML/LLM Ops: Experience or interest in building platforms specifically for Machine Learning workloads (GPU orchestration, model serving).
* Attributes: Exceptional attention to detail, strong analytical and problem\\-solving skills, and excellent written and verbal communication.
* Education: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).


****Experience We’d Be Particularly Excited About****
* You love experimenting
* You have experience or interest in machine learning
* You have experience or interest in RevOps, sales and marketing roles or software platform


****What To Expect****
 We conduct a rigorous interview process based on integrity, talent, and drive. We trust our teammates from day one and move quickly to evaluate whether you are fit for the role. The entire interview process typically takes two weeks. Here's what to expect:
   

  

* A 30 minute Zoom meeting to talk about Joist AI, your background, and answer any questions about the role.
* A 30 minute Zoom meeting with another one of our team members to hear more about your experience and how you'd approach working in the role.
* A take home project to assess your functional expertise for the role you're applying for.
