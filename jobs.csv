 About ReadyOS
 
 ReadyOS is building the coordination layer for rental property turnovers. Our platform connects operators and vendors, automates compliance, and simplifies payments—turning a fragmented process into a scalable system. We’re a fast\\-moving early\\-stage startup with a focus on shipping, iteration, and smart automation.
 



  




 Role Overview
 
 We are looking for a Software Development Tech Lead specializing in Xano, FlutterFlow, and API development to join our small but growing team
 **on\\-site in Koramangala** 
 . This person will align the work of frontend and backend developers, enforce technical standards, and keep delivery on schedule. The Tech Lead will also use their own experience building platforms to shape architecture decisions, review implementations, and ensure the system functions as one coherent product. While not expected to write every line of code, they must be able to dive into details, resolve blockers, and model best practices for the team.
 



  




 Responsibilities
 * Own the overall
 **technical architecture** 
 of the ReadyOS platform, ensuring frontend, backend, and APIs fit together cleanly.
* Define and enforce
 **development standards** 
 (naming conventions, API contracts, data models, release process).
* Coordinate delivery across backend and frontend teams to keep milestones on track.
* Review code and workflows, identify risks early, and drive fixes before they become delays.
* Translate product requirements into technical specs and ensure they’re achievable within the timeframe.
* Act as the
 **technical decision\\-maker** 
 on trade\\-offs (e.g., performance vs. scope, third\\-party integrations vs. in\\-house builds).
* Mentor team members, helping less experienced developers understand best practices.
* Liaise directly with founders to ensure business objectives and technical execution stay aligned.



  




 Requirements
 * **Strong English proficiency, both written and spoken, for clear collaboration.**
* Proven experience as a
 **Tech Lead, Engineering Lead, or Senior Engineer** 
 on a SaaS or marketplace platform.
* Strong grasp of system architecture and API\\-first design.
* Familiarity with both
 **frontend (FlutterFlow)** 
 and
 **backend (Xano/APIs, databases)** 
 development workflows.
* Demonstrated ability to coordinate distributed teams and deliver against milestones.
* Strong communication and documentation skills, especially in fast\\-moving startup environments.
* Ability to balance hands\\-on problem solving with leadership and oversight.



  




 Nice to Have
 * Experience in property\\-tech, workflow SaaS, or fintech platforms.
* Background in compliance, payments, or integrations with external APIs (i.e. Stripe Payments)
* Exposure to scaling systems across multiple regions or jurisdictions.
* Comfort with DevOps basics (CI/CD, environments, monitoring).
* Previous early\\-stage startup experience, ideally building MVPs that scaled into production.



  




 Why Join ReadyOS
 * Early impact: shape product decisions and architecture.
* Lean, execution\\-focused culture.
* Opportunities to grow into leadership as the company scales.
* Competitive contract rate and potential for equity bonus.



  




 Compensation \\& Incentives
 * **Primary structure:** 
 Contract\\-based, with base pay plus milestone bonuses (e.g., architecture, API specs, integrations, compliance modules). Payments are tied to milestone completion:



 Weekly base: ₹15,000
 



 Per milestone: ₹20,000 (×4 \\= ₹80,000\\)
 



 \\- Architecture \\& Plan Approval
 



 \\- Ongoing Review \\& Integration
 



 \\- Issue Resolution \\& QA Oversight
 



 \\- Final Acceptance
 



 8 weeks: ₹105,000 base \\+ ₹80,000 milestones \\=
 **₹200,000 total** 



* **Bonus Equity option:** 
 For the right candidates, we are open to granting a small equity stake (up to 0\\.05% \\~5,000 shares) as an on\\-time/quality bonus.
* **Future potential:** 
 Strong performers may transition into a longer\\-term or leadership role as the backend team expands, but no ongoing commitment is guaranteed at this point.","Real Estate","https://www.linkedin.com/company/readyos","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQH56axQL0Q-9w/company-logo_100_100/B4EZljbDVnHEAQ-/0/1758309660662?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=1V2XSPPZtngX7fLLGDbynyqwDVXhNe7-5ebHwOuGMZk","","","","","","","","","","",""
