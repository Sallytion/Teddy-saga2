 Walker Digital Table Systems (WDTS) is the global leader in smart table gaming technology. Our patented
 **PJM3\\.0™ RFID platform** 
 , combined with real\\-time software, analytics, and AI\\-driven capabilities, transforms live casino table games into secure, data\\-rich environments.
 



 Our products —
 **Perfect Pay™, Perfect Table™, and Perfect Cage™** 
 — are deployed in high‑volume, regulated casino environments worldwide. These systems operate in mission‑critical conditions where
 **accuracy, reliability, and release confidence are non‑negotiable** 
 .
 



  





**Role Purpose** 




 The Director of Quality Engineering is a
 **senior technology leader accountable for product quality, release confidence, and quality‑related risk across the WDTS platform** 
 .
 



 This role exists to address
 **systemic quality challenges and scale quality through platform evolution and AI‑driven automation** 
 , not to manage test execution alone. The Director defines and leads a
 **modern Quality Engineering operating model** 
 that:
 


* scales with architectural change,
* supports complex release types (major releases, feature sets, patches, hotfixes), and
* treats quality as a
 **business and operational risk** 
 , not merely a testing activity.



 A
 **core mandate of this role** 
 is to transform Quality Engineering into an
 **AI‑first discipline** 
 , where intelligent agents generate the majority of automated test cases, and QE leadership focuses on
 **risk modeling, test intent, governance, and release decisioning** 
 .
 



 The Director partners closely with
 **Architecture, Engineering, Product, DevOps, PMO, and Support** 
 to ensure quality readiness is
 **designed in, measured consistently, and clearly communicated at release decision points** 
 .
 



  





**Key Responsibilities** 




**1\\. Quality Strategy, Operating Model \\& Governance** 



* Define and own the
 **Quality Engineering operating model** 
 across all release types, ensuring it scales with architectural change and platform evolution.
* Establish a shared, defensible definition of
 **quality readiness** 
 , incorporating change impact, regression risk, defect exposure, environment readiness, and architectural dependencies.
* Shift quality from reactive testing to a
 **risk‑based, preventative discipline** 
 , treating quality as a business and operational risk.
* **What success looks like:**
* Quality decisions are predictable, risk‑informed, and consistently understood across the organization.



**2\\. AI‑First Quality Engineering Transformation** 



* Lead the transformation of QE into an
 **AI‑first discipline** 
 , with agent‑driven test generation producing the majority of new automated coverage.
* Define where AI is trusted end‑to‑end versus where
 **human oversight and explicit quality gates** 
 remain required.
* Establish governance standards for AI‑generated tests, including framework conformity, correctness, coverage, stability, and maintainability.
* Champion
 **agentic testing workflows** 
 (planning, generation, execution, healing) as a first‑class QE capability.
* **What success looks like:**
* QE effort shifts from test execution to
 **test intent, risk analysis, and quality governance** 
 , while automation scales sustainably.



**3\\. Test Architecture, DevOps \\& Continuous Quality** 



* Define and oversee
 **end‑to‑end test strategies** 
 spanning embedded RFID hardware, firmware, real‑time backend systems, data integrity, UI/UX, and cross‑system integrations.
* Ensure test architecture is
 **stable, scalable, and agent‑friendly** 
 , with automation treated as a platform capability rather than a coverage metric.
* Embed quality into
 **CI/CD pipelines** 
 , defining release‑readiness standards, quality KPIs, and regression frameworks.
* Own production quality feedback loops, including observability, post‑release metrics, incident RCA, and continuous improvement.



**4\\. Release Readiness, Compliance \\& Executive Leadership** 



* Act as the
 **single accountable leader for quality readiness at release time** 
 , ensuring decisions are driven by risk and impact rather than test counts.
* Identify and escalate quality risks early, clearly articulating
 **business, customer, and operational impact** 
 .
* Partner with Compliance and Regulatory teams to ensure readiness for
 **gaming lab certifications and regional regulatory requirements** 
 , with full traceability from requirements to validation.
* Lead and develop the Quality Engineering organization as a
 **strategic partner** 
 , representing quality and release risk credibly at senior leadership and executive forums.



  





  





**What This Role Is Not:** 



* Not a manual testing manager role
* Not a tooling‑only automation lead
* Not a role measured by test counts alone



**This role is accountable for:** 



* quality outcomes,
* AI‑first QE transformation,
* automation as an engineering system,
* and release confidence.



  





**Ideal Candidate Profile** 




**Required Experience** 



* 10\\+ years in Quality Engineering, with 5\\+ years in senior leadership roles.
* Proven experience leading quality in
 **complex, distributed, high‑reliability systems** 
 .
* Strong understanding of:
* release management and regression strategy
* automation frameworks and CI/CD integration
* architecture‑driven quality risk
* Experience operating credibly with architects, senior engineers, and executives.



**Strongly Preferred** 



* Experience operationalizing
 **AI‑assisted or agent‑driven test generation** 
 beyond experimentation.
* Experience defining
 **governance and evaluation frameworks** 
 for AI outputs.
* Background in regulated or high‑stakes environments (gaming, fintech, medical, aerospace, defense).
* Familiarity with embedded systems, real‑time transaction platforms, or hybrid edge environments.



  





**Why This Role Exists** 




 WDTS is evolving its platform architecture while supporting complex, regulated deployments worldwide. This role ensures that
 **quality scales with that change** 
 , leveraging AI to improve coverage and speed
 **without increasing risk** 
 , and that release decisions are made with clarity, consistency, and executive confidence.","Software Development and Gambling Facilities and Casinos","https://www.linkedin.com/company/walker-digital-table-systems","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQEU2okCFGEfAw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1631309595601?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=j1Xh4gdHuCbfHk4tQPVV9Y-1_bNYAqF1u8rseBR7-Wc","","","","","","","","","","",""
