* Work closely with our research team and product engineers to translate cutting edge research into incredible products
* Build highly parallel, high quality data processing and evaluation infrastructure for foundation model training


 You'll have significant autonomy to shape our products and directly impact how cutting\\-edge AI is applied across various devices and applications.
   

  

**What You'll Bring**
 Given the scale and difficulty of problems we work on, we value strong engineering skills at Cartesia.
   

  

* Strong engineering skills, comfortable navigating complex codebases and monorepos.
* An eye for craft and writing clean and maintainable code.
* You're comfortable diving into new technologies and can quickly adapt your skills to our tech stack (Go and Python on the backend, Next.js for the frontend).
* Experience building large\\-scale distributed systems with high demands on performance, reliability, and observability.
* Technical leadership with the ability to execute and deliver zero\\-to\\-one results amidst ambiguity.
* \\[bonus] Background in or experience working with machine learning and generative models.
