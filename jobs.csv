* Hands\\-on expertise in MID Server Installation, Upgrades \\& Troubleshooting.
* Integration Experience: Proven ability to integrate ServiceNow with other platforms and other in\\-house monitoring tools and applications via flow designers, web services and OOTB plugins and configurations. (Ex \\- MS Teams, JIRA, Workday, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Gitlab, IIQ)
* Continuous Improvement \\& Platform Maintenance: Ability to support and develop new features, maintain platform functionality, carry out annual ServiceNow upgrades, and troubleshoot technical/process issues reported by process governors or end users adhering to stringent SLAs and have a strong focus on ongoing process optimization and ensuring seamless integration across various modules.
