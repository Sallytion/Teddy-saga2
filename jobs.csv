**About Matrimony.com** 




 Matrimony.com Ltd is India’s largest WedTech company and the first pure\\-play consumer internet business in the category to be publicly listed. What started as matchmaking has evolved into a multi\\-vertical consumer platform that supports people across the entire marriage and relationship journey.
 



  





 Today, our ecosystem spans: \\- Matchmaking platforms (BharatMatrimony, CommunityMatrimony, EliteMatrimony) \\- Marriage \\& wedding services marketplaces (Mandap.com, WeddingBazaar) \\- Assisted services \\& concierge\\-led offerings \\- Jobs \\& livelihood platforms (ManyJobs) \\- AI\\-led
 



 discovery, guidance and support experiences cutting across these verticals.
 



 We operate at significant scale, solving complex problems across marketplaces, trust \\& safety, monetisation, growth, supply–demand balance, and AI\\-assisted decision\\-making. Our ambition is to build a category\\-defining, enduring consumer internet institution.
 



  





**The Opportunity** 




 We're not maintaining legacy systems or gluing SaaS tools together. We're building intelligent, AI\\-first products from the ground up — systems that process language, operate at massive scale, and solve problems that actually matter. If you want to write code that ships to millions, this is where you should be.
 



  





**What You'll Do** 



* Write clean, production\\-grade code across the stack — backend services, APIs, web, and mobile
* Build and ship features end\\-to\\-end, from database schema to pixel\\-perfect UI
* Work with distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines
* Collaborate closely with designers, product, and fellow engineers to solve real user problems
* Continuously raise the bar on code quality, performance, and reliability



  





**What You Bring** 



* **5\\+ years of hands\\-on software engineering** 
 — you write code every day and love it
* The kind of engineer whose code others learn from — readable, well\\-structured, and thoughtful
* Strong proficiency in
 **Node.js, React, and TypeScript**
* **Experience with React Native or Flutter** 
 is a plus
* Solid understanding of
 **distributed systems, APIs, and databases**
* **Comfortable with Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)**
* **Genuinely passionate about building systems — you dig into the ""why"" behind architecture decisions**
* **A fast learner who stays curious — you pick up new tools, languages, and frameworks because you want to, not because you have to**
* **You bring energy, ownership, and a bias for action — waiting for instructions isn't your style**



  





**Why This Role Is Different** 




 You're not inheriting a legacy system and keeping the lights on. You're building something new — with real AI use cases, a greenfield architecture, and the autonomy to make impactful technical decisions. If you've been waiting for a role where engineering leadership means actually engineering, let's talk.
