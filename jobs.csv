 At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.
 



 To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.
 



 Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.
 



 While many roles at Coinbase are remote\\-first, we are not remote\\-only. In\\-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company\\-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.
 



 The mission of the Platform Product Group engineers is to build a trusted, scalable and compliant platform to operate with speed, efficiency and quality. Our teams build and maintain the platforms critical to the existence of Coinbase. There are many teams that make up this group which include Product Foundations (i.e. Identity, Payment, Risk, Proofing \\& Regulatory, Finhub), Machine Learning, Customer Experience, and Infrastructure.
   

  

 Finance Engineering team is building Coinbase’s financial nervous system: a unified, automated reconciliation and payments\\-data platform that Finance relies on to close the books with precision, speed, and audit‑grade controls. In 2026, we’re making daily, transaction‑level cash reconciliation the standard across our businesses, shipping a unified recon interface that spans cash and crypto, standardizing external bank and processor data with enforceable quality contracts, and compressing finance reviews to a single clean iteration.
 



 As a Senior Software Engineer at Coinbase,  you will join our team to build out the next generation of crypto\\-forward products and features. You will solve unique, large scale, highly complex technical problems, bridging the constraints posed by web\\-scale applications and blockchain technology. You will help build the next generation of systems to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone across the globe, operating real\\-time applications with high frequency, low latency updates, and managing the most secure, dockerized infrastructure running in the cloud.
   

  





**What you’ll be doing** 
 :
 


* Build new services to meet critical product and business needs using Golang.
* Design scalable systems to solve novel problems with modern cloud technology and industry best practices.
* Articulate a long term vision for maintaining and scaling our backend systems and the teams running them.
* Work with engineers, designers, product managers and senior leadership to turn our product and technical vision into a tangible roadmap every quarter.
* Write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers. Debugging extremely difficult technical problems, and making systems and products both work better and are easier to deploy, own, operate and diagnose.
* Review all feature designs within your product area and across the company for cross\\-cutting projects. Be an owner of the security, safety, scale, operational integrity, and architectural clarity of these designs.
* Streamline processes in accounting, tax, treasury, and finance operations.
* Reduce reliance on manual tools by implementing AI/ML\\-driven automation



**What we look for in you:** 



* You have at least 5\\+ years of experience in software engineering.
* You’ve designed, built, scaled and maintained production services, and know how to compose a service oriented architecture.
* You write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers.
* You’re passionate about building an open financial system that brings the world together.
* You possess strong technical skills for system design and coding
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, and a bias toward open, transparent cultural practices.



**Nice to haves** 
 :
 


* You have gone through a rapid growth in your company (from startup to mid\\-size).
* Experience with  growth experiments or A/B testing frameworks.
* You have experience with Blockchain technology (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc..)
* You’ve worked with Golang, Docker, Rails, Postgres, MongoDB or DynamoDB.
