In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

* TimeBack: An educational platform that supports Alpha School's 2\\-hour learning model (achieving 99th percentile test outcomes).
* Incept: A content generation platform producing all personalized educational materials for multiple learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
* Crossover: An AI\\-powered hiring platform that processes tens of thousands of candidates monthly, staffing schools and organizations worldwide.


 You will take ownership of one of these platforms and dedicate the majority of your time to constructing the most complex components of the codebase with a compact team (3\\-5 experienced engineers, no junior members). The architectural choices you make will dictate whether other teams can quickly develop new applications, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Correct decisions unlock enormous leverage. Poor decisions generate integration chaos and erode velocity across numerous teams.
   

  

 You design, build, and operate. You define quality standards and technical patterns for your platform. Our approach is specification\\-driven: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. You will work with high autonomy—no committees, no approval boards. This is a small, cohesive team where accountability for what you deliver is direct.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Define strategic architectural choices and set technical patterns for the team's execution.
* AI Leadership: Champion the adoption of emerging AI workflows and develop high\\-impact playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the complex, mission\\-critical sections of the codebase in collaboration with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Validate that your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality benchmarks.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Serving as an architect in theory without hands\\-on implementation
* Spending time trapped in continuous meetings
* Managing personnel (this role focuses on technical leadership, not people management)
* Maintaining legacy systems or handling internal IT infrastructure


**Basic Requirements**
**Senior Software Architect key responsibilities**
* A minimum of 5 years of professional software development experience delivering software products
* A minimum of 3 years in a role as either a lead engineer (conducting code reviews) or architect (making critical technical decisions)
* Proven experience developing platform\\-level products where APIs you built were consumed by other teams
* Strong engagement with AI tools, consistently experimenting and exploring new possibilities


**About LearnWith.AI**
 LearnWith.AI is an edtech startup that leverages AI and subject matter experts to cultivate a new way of learning. Our unique approach leverages 50\\+ years of learning science, cutting\\-edge data analytics and AI\\-powered coaching. In doing so, we can help students learn more, learn faster, and learn better \\- and have fun while doing it. We are a remote\\-first company that hires globally via Crossover.

**Working with us**
 This is a full\\-time (40 hours per week), long\\-term position. The position is immediately available and requires entering into an independent contractor agreement with Crossover as a Contractor of Record. The compensation level for this role is $100 USD/hour, which equates to $200,000 USD/year assuming 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. The payment period is weekly.
