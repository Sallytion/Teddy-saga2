 **Retell AI Voice Agent Developer Intern (Full\\-Time)** 




**Company name : AI Handles Calls** 




**Company Website** 
 : https://www.aihandlescalls.com
 



  





**About the Role** 




 We are looking for a hands\\-on Retell AI Voice Agent Developer who enjoys building real, production\\-grade voice agents end\\-to\\-end. This role is ideal for someone who has already experimented, shipped, and iterated on AI voice agents — especially for US\\-based businesses.
 



 This is not a research or theory\\-heavy role. You will be building, testing, and improving live voice agents that handle real customer calls.
 



  





**What you’ll do** 



* Build and deploy production\\-ready voice agents using Retell AI
* Design multi\\-prompt and multi\\-intent conversation flows
* Integrate voice agents with n8n for workflows like:
* Scheduling \\& rescheduling
* CRM updates
* Notifications and webhooks
* Work with US phone systems (e.g. RingCentral or similar) for:
* Call forwarding
* Call transfer to human agents
* Test, debug, and iterate on voice agents using structured scenarios
* Improve agent reliability, latency, and conversation quality



  





**What we’re looking for** 



* Experience with Retell AI (hands\\-on, not just tutorials)
* Experience using n8n for backend automation
* Comfort working with voice, prompts, and real user conversations
* Ability to think in terms of edge cases and failure scenarios



 We care more about what you’ve built than years of experience or degrees.
 



  





**Nice to Have (Not Mandatory)** 



* Experience building for US customers or businesses
* Multi\\-lingual voice agents
* Experience with call routing, transfers, and fallbacks
* Prior exposure to testing frameworks or scenario\\-based testing



  





**Please note:** 
 This role is open to college students and recent graduates who want hands\\-on experience building real production voice agents. The stipend is ₹10,000 per month, with an additional ₹5,000 bonus for every successful client implementation. We value practical building experience over formal credentials.","Human Resources Services","https://in.linkedin.com/company/hrgenie","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFnJFm2fiZh9w/company-logo_100_100/B56ZYBNy9LHEAQ-/0/1743777117245/hrgenie_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=mLsbO3c_xd2tIcqFlrxRU3Ysyc3qtLMDZRlUDoMiZhA","","","","","","","","","","",""
