 We are a growing tech startup based in Mangalore, Karnataka, focused on building cutting\\-edge AI solutions that solve real\\-world problems. Our mission is to bring world\\-class technology innovation to the coastal paradise of Mangalore, creating opportunities for talented professionals to build impactful careers in their hometown.
 



  





 The Opportunity
 



 We're looking for a passionate Junior AI Engineer to join our core team \\-
 **this role is open only to candidates based in or around Mangalore** 
 . This is an exceptional opportunity for recent graduates or early\\-career professionals to work on cutting\\-edge AI technology including agentic AI, vector search, and recommendation systems, while enjoying the quality of life that Mangalore offers.
 



  





 Startup Advantage: Accelerated Growth \\& Equity
 



 Unlike traditional corporate roles, joining our early\\-stage startup offers unique advantages that can supercharge your career:
 



 •Accelerated Learning: In our startup environment, you'll gain experience across multiple domains in months that might take years in larger companies. You'll work directly with founders and senior engineers, participating in key decisions and seeing how all aspects of a tech business operate.
 



 •Broader Skill Development: Rather than being siloed into narrow responsibilities, you'll have exposure to the entire product development lifecycle—from ideation and architecture to deployment and customer feedback.
 



 •Private Equity Opportunity: We believe in sharing our success with the team that helps build it. As an early employee, you'll receive an equity package that gives you actual ownership in the company. As the company grows in value, so does your stake—potentially worth significantly more than your salary over time.
 



 •Direct Impact: Your code and contributions will directly impact the product and company trajectory. You'll see your work in production quickly and receive immediate feedback, creating a rewarding sense of ownership and accomplishment.
 



 •Career Fast\\-Track: The skills, responsibility, and experience you gain in our startup environment will position you years ahead of peers following traditional career paths, whether you choose to grow with us long\\-term or pursue other opportunities in the future.
 



  





 Role Overview
 



 As a Junior AI Engineer at our startup, you will work alongside experienced team members to develop and implement AI solutions. You'll have the opportunity to learn and grow in the exciting fields of agentic AI and recommendation systems while making meaningful contributions to our products.
 



 Your journey will begin with understanding our existing AI infrastructure and gradually taking on more responsibility as you develop your skills. You'll assist in implementing machine learning models, help optimize algorithms, and contribute to data processing pipelines. With guidance from senior team members, you'll gain hands\\-on experience with vector search technologies and recommendation systems, applying theoretical knowledge to real\\-world problems.
 



 This role offers a supportive learning environment where you can build practical experience in AI development while receiving mentorship from experienced professionals. As you grow, you'll have increasing opportunities to propose ideas, lead smaller projects, and develop specialized expertise in areas that interest you most.
 



  





 Qualifications and Experience
 



 The ideal candidate has recently completed a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, AI, Machine Learning, or a related field from a reputable institution. While extensive professional experience isn't required, we value candidates who have demonstrated their interest and aptitude for AI through:
 



 •Strong foundational knowledge in machine learning concepts and algorithms
 



 •Basic programming skills in Python
 



 •Familiarity with AI/ML frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow (even if only through academic projects)
 



 •Understanding of data structures and algorithms
 



 •Eagerness to learn new technologies and concepts quickly
 



 •Ability to work collaboratively in a team environment
 



 •Good communication skills for discussing technical concepts
 



**Projects or coursework related to natural language processing, recommendation systems, or AI agents would be particularly relevant, though not required. More important is your enthusiasm for AI and willingness to learn.** 




  





 Why Join Us?
 



 This position offers an exceptional opportunity for career growth in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. You'll gain hands\\-on experience with cutting\\-edge technologies while working in a supportive environment that encourages learning and development.
 



 We provide:
 



 •Equity package that gives you ownership in the company you're helping build
 



 •Structured mentorship from experienced AI professionals
 



 •A learning\\-focused environment that supports your professional growth
 



 •Exposure to the complete AI development lifecycle
