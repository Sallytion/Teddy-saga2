That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI.
   

  

 We’re looking for JavaScript coding specialists who live and breathe algorithms, data structures, software architecture, frontend and backend development, cloud infrastructure, and systems programming—and who can do so fluently using JavaScript. You’ll challenge advanced language models on topics like asynchronous programming, RESTful API integration, memory management, object\\-oriented design, secure coding practices, and debugging distributed systems—documenting every failure mode so we can harden model reasoning.
   

  

 On a typical day, you will converse with the model on software engineering tasks and technical scenarios using JavaScript, verify logical accuracy and coding fluency, assess code quality and clarity, capture reproducible error traces, and suggest improvements to our prompt engineering and evaluation metrics.
   

  

 A bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD in computer science, software engineering, or a closely related technical field is ideal; real\\-world JavaScript experience, technical writing, or open\\-source contributions signal fit. Clear, metacognitive communication—“showing your work”—is essential.
   

  

 Ready to turn your JavaScript coding expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world.
   

  

 We offer a pay range of $8‑to‑$65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above. As a contractor you’ll supply a secure computer and high‑speed internet; company‑sponsored benefits such as health insurance and PTO do not apply.

 If you're ready to make an impact and grow your career, Legion is where you belong. Join us in making hourly work rewarding and fulfilling.
   

  

**BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY**
 There are almost 75 million hourly workers in the United States, representing more than half of the entire workforce. Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees. The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig\\-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options. Legion's mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by Legion's Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously.
   

  

 Legion WFM was built for the cloud with AI at the core and is designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses and meet the needs of today's hourly employees. Our team is composed of dedicated individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, globally distributed across all time zones.
