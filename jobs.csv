 Crux was founded in 2017 to address the challenges organizations face when bringing in external data from disparate sources for analytics, data science, and business intelligence. The company has built a platform that automates key parts of the external data workflow: integrating third\\-party datasets, transforming them into useful formats, ensuring continuous data quality, and managing operational aspects like supplier contracts, data delivery, and observability.
 



 Many businesses depend increasingly on external data (market data, alternative data, etc.), but integrating that data reliably and tracking issues (data delays, format changes, missing values, etc.) is hard. Crux works as the bridge between data suppliers and consumers, helping to reduce manual work and risk. Its infrastructure is cloud\\-oriented and built for scale, supporting observability (so teams see when data is stale or wrong), transformation (cleaning, reshaping), and making data science\\-ready inputs.
 



  





 The company has raised venture funding (Series B) to accelerate its product development, expand its team, and deepen its capabilities. Investors include large financial \\& analytics\\-oriented firms. Crux is used by organizations that need trustworthy external data pipelines so they can focus more on insights than fixing data issues.

 CodeWiser is building the AI infrastructure for the next generation of engineering education. We are moving beyond standard LMS features to create an industrial simulation engine that tests students on latency, security, and system resilience. We are a high\\-velocity team building the tools that will define the future of technical hiring and training in India.
 



  




 The Projects
 
 You will not be fixing UI bugs. You will be assigned to one of two mission\\-critical backend systems:
 


1. **Sandboxed Code Execution Engine:** 
 You will help build a secure, isolated remote code execution service (microservice) that powers our integrated learning environment. This involves handling untrusted code and optimizing for sub\\-second latency.
2. **Code Analysis API:** 
 You will develop a rapid, high\\-throughput API designed to perform static analysis, linting, and logical validation on student submissions.



**The ""High\\-Performance"" Track:** 
 Interns who demonstrate exceptional understanding of systems will be invited to work on our
 **AI Layer** 
 . This involves distilling Large Language Models (LLMs) and fine\\-tuning domain\\-specific models for automated tutoring.
 



  




 The Tech Stack
 * **Core Framework:** 
 Next.js (Frontend \\& Backend orchestration).
* **Microservices:** 
 Node.js or Python.
* **Database:** 
 PostgreSQL.
* **Infrastructure:** 
 Serverless Functions (Vercel/Neon).



  




 Requirements
 * **Stack Proficiency:** 
 You must be comfortable with
 **Next.js** 
 for full\\-stack logic. For the microservices, deep knowledge of
 **Node.js** 
 or
 **Python** 
 is required.
* **Database Skills:** 
 Working knowledge of
 **PostgreSQL** 
 . You should understand relational schema design and basic query optimization.
* **API Design:** 
 Strong grasp of
 **REST API** 
 principles.
* **Serverless Architecture:** 
 Experience or strong conceptual understanding of deploying to serverless environments (handling cold starts, statelessness, limits).



  




 Bonus Points
 * **Distributed Systems:** 
 Understanding how to architect systems that communicate asynchronously and handle failures gracefully.
* **LLM Experience:** 
 Any exposure to training, fine\\-tuning, or implementing RAG pipelines.



  




 Logistics \\& Compensation
 * **Duration:** 
 1 Month (Winter Internship / December \\- January).
* **Location:** 
 100% Remote.
* **Compensation:** 
**Unpaid.** 
 This is a learning\\-intensive role designed for students who want to put a production\\-grade, distributed system on their resume.
* **Perks:** 
 Direct mentorship from the founder, potential for a Letter of Recommendation based on performance, and exposure to cutting\\-edge AI infrastructure.","Education","https://in.linkedin.com/company/code-wiser-io","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQGQejnw7ke54Q/company-logo_100_100/B4DZid9GbvHYAU-/0/1754996700186?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=jnwsO3_PEh9hK2w2EJspW9AVzLkmWYL1em_jwDHstKE","","","","","","","","","","",""
