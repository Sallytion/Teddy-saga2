 BT Group was the world’s first telco and our heritage in the sector is unrivalled. As home to several of the UK’s most recognised and cherished brands – BT, EE, Openreach and Plusnet, we have always played a critical role in creating the future, and we have reached an inflection point in the transformation of our business.

Together with our heavy investment in 5G, we play a central role in revolutionising how people connect with each other.
 



 While we are through the most capital\\-intensive phase of our fibre investment, meaning we can reward our shareholders for their commitment and patience, we are absolutely focused on how we organise ourselves in the best way to serve our customers in the years to come.

Together with our application of AI and technology, we are on a path to creating the UK’s best telco, reimagining the customer experience and relationship with one of this country’s biggest infrastructure companies.
 



 Change on the scale we will all experience in the coming years is unprecedented. BT Group is committed to being the driving force behind improving connectivity for millions and there has never been a more exciting time to join a company and leadership team with the skills, experience, creativity, and passion to take this company into a new era.

 Your primary customer initially will be
 **Flywheel** 
 , a US\\-based transportation technology company rebuilding regulated taxi infrastructure across major cities. The role will later expand into other AI\\-native platforms we build.
 



  





 We’re looking for a
 **senior backend engineer with strong Go expertise** 
 who thrives in fast\\-moving environments, picks up new tools instantly, and uses AI to multiply velocity by 10x–100x.
 



 This is not for average engineers. This is for builders who want to operate at the edge of product \\+ engineering \\+ AI.
 



  





**What You Will Do:** 




**Backend Ownership (Primary)** 



* Design, build, and maintain
 **Go\\-based microservices** 
 powering real\\-time, high reliability systems.

**End\\-to\\-End Ownership** 



* Architecture → implementation → testing → deployment → monitoring → iteration.
* Write clean Go code with clear abstraction boundaries.
* Debug complex distributed issues across logs, metrics, traces, and event streams.
* Improve engineering velocity, reliability, and system clarity.



  





**Core Technical Requirements:** 




**Must\\-Have** 



* **Strong proficiency in Go (Golang)** 
 — concurrency patterns, goroutines, channels, sync primitives, memory model.
* **Experience building and scaling marketplace or logistics platforms** 
 at companies like Uber, Lyft, Ola, Zepto, Swiggy, DoorDash, Dunzo, Meesho, or similar.
* Deep understanding of:

**4\\. Geospatial \\& Routing (Nice\\-to\\-Have but Relevant)** 



* Working with maps, ETA models, geofencing
* H3/geohash grids
* Real\\-time distance/time calculations



**5\\. Systems Thinking** 



* Rate limiting and throttling
* Multi\\-region scaling strategies
* Horizontal service decomposition



**6\\. Security and Compliance** 



* API authentication patterns
* Least\\-privilege data access
* Auditing and regulatory data retention
* (Especially relevant because Flywheel operates in regulated markets.)



  





**You’ll Succeed Here If You Are:** 



* A
 **Go expert** 
 who writes clean, elegant, battle\\-tested backend services.
* AI\\-native — you treat AI as a force multiplier, not a novelty.
* A builder who likes
 **ambiguity** 
 , takes ownership, and moves fast.
* Low\\-ego, highly collaborative, and motivated by the pursuit of mastery.
* Obsessed with reliability, correctness, and predictable system behavior.
* Able to work across backend, frontend, architecture, infra, and ops.
* Excited by hard engineering problems in mobility \\+ marketplaces.



  





 Years of experience don’t matter.
 **Output, clarity, and capability do.**

 SPAN develops products that accelerate the rapid adoption of renewable energy in the home. The flagship SPAN Smart Panel is the first true evolution for the traditional home electric panel, harnessing enhanced technology for metering, monitoring, and control. An expanded product suite of intelligent, integrated solutions radically lowers the cost and complexity of energy upgrades–including solar, batteries and EVs–empowering homeowners to be active, resilient and informed players in the energy market.
   

  

**The Team and Role**
 SPAN’s Device Software team is responsible for all of the software that is physically embodied in our hardware products. Our first product \\- the SPAN Panel \\- contains a complex network of microcontrollers and a single board computer that must work together to react quickly to changing conditions with impeccable reliability in order to perform its job. We look for friendly, excellent engineers who enjoy working with their peers to solve complex problems and prioritize trusting that the people we hire are capable of great things when well supported. Engineers work directly with the broader software, product, and hardware teams to ensure the right things get built at the right time.
   

  

 As an engineer on the Device Software team you will define and implement new features directly related to SPAN’s hardware products focusing on the lowest level \\- the microcontroller. This includes everything from bootloaders on systems without an OS up through applications in C and C\\+\\+ inside an RTOS. Hardware products are central to SPAN’s business and writing firmware for even our smallest microcontrollers means working on something that directly impacts the user experience. You will own large user\\-facing features from conception through implementation on future hardware products, working independently to bring them to completion.
   

  

**Representative Projects**
* Designing an OTA system that encompasses a variety of communication interfaces, processor types, and products, while achieving both secure goals for hardware\\-backed encryption and verification and high reliability.
* Working with system architects to invent a data steaming architecture for a new product family which can satisfy both the needs of the data science team to access high rate and quality data, as well as safety guarantees around consistency and accuracy.
* Representing the Device Software team in group settings and evangelizing engineering best practices. Participating in code and design reviews as well as authoring documents which further reinforce these goals, and supporting engineers across the org in hitting them.
