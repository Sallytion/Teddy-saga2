 Performance Engineering (PE) QA Lead Requirement
 



 Role Overview The PE QA Lead will own the performance engineering function (not just testing), driving end\\-to\\-end system performance improvements across front\\-end, API, and infrastructure layers. This role is not limited to scripting or SRE functions, but focuses on diagnosing and improving system performance, defining strategies, and mentoring a small technical team.
 



 Key Responsibilities
 



 Act as the technical owner for performance optimization across applications and platforms. Define performance strategy – identify metrics, bottlenecks, and optimization pathways. Review and contribute to performance scripts (e.g., JMeter, LoadRunner), but scripting is only \\~20–30% of responsibility. Analyze and correlate performance data from observability tools (e.g., DataDog, APM tools, Grafana, etc.) to pinpoint latency and load issues. Work closely with engineering and development teams to identify root causes and recommend architectural or code improvements. Establish performance baselines, KPIs, and best practices for consistent monitoring. Guide and mentor the existing team of 3 performance engineers (Rohit, Kartika, and Malit). Drive ownership, accountability, and performance advocacy across QA and engineering.
 



**Must\\-Have Skills** 




 Strong engineering mindset focused on performance optimization beyond scripting. Hands\\-on experience with tools like JMeter, LoadRunner, or Gatling. Solid understanding of observability and monitoring platforms (DataDog, AppDynamics, Dynatrace, etc.). Knowledge of web page performance optimization, API latency analysis, and microservices performance tuning. Ability to analyze front\\-end vs back\\-end performance gaps. Strong collaboration and communication skills to influence development teams. Preferred Qualifications Experience with site reliability engineering (SRE) principles (alerting, observability, error budgets).
 



 Familiarity with cloud performance monitoring (AWS/GCP/Azure). Proven experience in performance test strategy and governance. Excellent analytical and diagnostic problem\\-solving abilities.","IT Services and IT Consulting, Business Consulting and Services, and Information Services","https://in.linkedin.com/company/peopleprimeww","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFXMNnAtaU2qA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1738582300818/peopleprimeww_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=46Euex735XHnnSL-4JCCUWosRqNQHcuDHCtDgn3B-XU","","","","","","","","","","",""
