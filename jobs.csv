**We want all new Associates to succeed in their roles at Ensono. That's why we've outlined the job requirements below. To be considered for this role, it's important that you meet all Required Qualifications. If you do not meet all of the Preferred Qualifications, we still encourage you to apply.** 
  

  

**Required Skills \\& Experience**
* Strong programming skills in Python (must\\-have) and experience with additional languages such as C, C\\+\\+, Go, Javascript, etc is beneficial.
* Proven experience with API development (REST, GraphQL) and frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, or Spring.
* Familiarity with Snowflake and integrating with data\\-driven backends.
* Experience building front\\-end or dashboard solutions (Streamlit, React, NextJS, Tailwind or similar frameworks).
* Proficiency with Kubernetes, Docker, or other orchestration tools.
* Background in developing enterprise\\-grade, highly available software systems.
* Experience integrating with ServiceNow or other ITSM platforms is highly desirable.
* Expertise with Ansible and other automation platforms is a key requirement. You’ll be working closely with operations to turn AI/ML outputs to real world actions and playbooks.


**Mindset \\& Values**
* Get Stuff Done – You ship reliable code that drives business outcomes, not just prototypes.
* Builder Mentality – You take pride in designing elegant, scalable software solutions.
* Impact\\-Oriented – You measure success by the value your applications deliver to Ops teams and clients.
* Collaborative Developer – You work hand\\-in\\-hand with Data, ML, and Ops to turn AI into usable products.
* User\\-Focused – You design with the operator in mind, making AI transparent, explainable, and actionable.


**Success Looks Like**
* APIs that seamlessly deliver AI insights into ServiceNow and EnvisionOS workflows.

 With 9\\+ years of deep expertise, we build automation tools, lead complex migrations, and solve high\\-impact performance and database challenges. We are ISO and PCI\\-DSS certified, combining engineering excellence with enterprise\\-grade security and compliance.
   

  

**Role**
 You'll architect and build our frontend from the ground up, crafting a modern, production\\-ready agentic AI application that makes complex database insights clear, accessible, and actionable.

 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
