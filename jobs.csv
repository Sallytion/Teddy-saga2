We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.
 



 Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.
 



 While many roles at Coinbase are remote\\-first, we are not remote\\-only. In\\-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company\\-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.
 



 The mission of the Platform Product Group engineers is to build a trusted, scalable and compliant platform to operate with speed, efficiency and quality. Our teams build and maintain the platforms critical to the existence of Coinbase.

* Build new services to meet critical product and business needs using Golang / Java
* Design scalable systems to solve novel problems with modern cloud technology and industry best practices.
* Articulate a long term vision for maintaining and scaling our backend systems and the teams running them.
* Work with engineers, designers, product managers and senior leadership to turn our product and technical vision into a tangible roadmap every quarter.
* Write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers. Debugging extremely difficult technical problems, and making systems and products both work better and are easier to deploy, own, operate and diagnose.
* Review all feature designs within your product area and across the company for cross\\-cutting projects. Be an owner of the security, safety, scale, operational integrity, and architectural clarity of these designs.



**What we look for in you:** 



* You have at least 8\\+ years of experience in software engineering
* You’ve designed, built, scaled and maintained production services, and know how to compose a service oriented architecture.
* You write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers.

* Experience with  growth experiments or A/B testing frameworks.
* You have experience with Blockchain technology (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc..)
