 FlytBase is the Physical AI software platform powering autonomous drones and robots across industries globally. Our cloud, edge, and on\\-premise solutions enable autonomous systems to operate 24/7 at oil \\& gas sites, solar farms, rail yards, ports, mining operations, utilities, plantations, and smart cities—detecting threats, predicting failures, and keeping operations running smoothly.
 



  





 The FlytBase platform orchestrates fleets of third\\-party drones and robots, correlates data from multiple sensors, IoT devices, and enterprise systems, and applies AI/ML analytics to predict problems before they happen.
 



  





 Organizations across railroads, mining, energy, utilities, plantations, real estate, and public safety rely on FlytBase to run autonomous operations at scale.
 



  





 We’ve deployed at 300\\+ sites worldwide, built the largest partner \\& system integrator network (50\\+), and integrated with leading enterprise solutions including GIS, UAV/drone platforms, surveillance systems, mapping tools, and industrial analytics software—creating a unified operational brain for physical sites.
 



  





 FlytBase is redefining industrial automation and physical site monitoring through software.
 



  





**The Role** 




 This is not a typical software engineering role. We’re looking for builders who thrive at the intersection of AI, robotics, and industrial automation. You will be part of a high\\-performance team driving the future of autonomous operations globally. This role demands end\\-to\\-end ownership, from ideation and prototyping to production\\-grade deployment, across front\\-end, back\\-end, cloud, edge, and AI systems.
 



  





 You will work with cutting\\-edge AI/ML models, computer vision pipelines, autonomous fleet orchestration, real\\-time data streams, and industrial IoT integration. If you are someone who wants to leave a tangible impact on industries like energy, mining, logistics, utilities, plantations, and public safety, this is the role for you.
 



  





**What You'll Own** 




 •
 **Full\\-Stack Product Ownership** 
 → Design, implement, test, and deploy features across UI, backend, microservices, and cloud/edge platforms.

 → Design pipelines that collect, process, and visualize multi\\-source sensor data, enabling predictive maintenance and operational optimization.
 



**• Rapid Prototyping** 
 → Turn raw ideas into working prototypes, test them in real\\-world scenarios, iterate fast, and ship production\\-ready solutions.
 



 •
 **Cross\\-Functional Collaboration →** 
 Work with product, operations, and field teams to understand pain points and translate them into high\\-impact technical solutions.
 



 •
 **High\\-Velocity Execution →** 
 Operate at startup speed within an enterprise\\-grade environment, balancing speed, quality, and reliability.
 



  





**Best Suited For** 




**AI\\-Native** 
 → You leverage AI not as a buzzword, but as a core tool to enhance decision\\-making, automation, and operational efficiency.
 



**Full\\-Stack Builder** 
 → Comfortable working across front\\-end, back\\-end, cloud, edge, and embedded systems.
 



**Velocity\\-Oriented** 
 → You ship fast, iterate often, and always optimize for outcomes over perfection.
 



**Problem\\-First →** 
 Tool\\-agnostic mindset: you pick technology to solve problems, not follow trends.
 



**Ownership \\& Accountability →** 
 You own features, bugs, sprints, and outcomes end\\-to\\-end without handholding.
 



**Legacy\\-Minded** 
 → You are motivated by impact, war stories, and leaving a lasting mark on the future of industrial automation.
 



**Adaptable \\& Curiou** 
 s → Able to learn new frameworks, AI models, and industrial protocols quickly, and thrive in fast\\-changing environments.
 



  





**Our Stack (Sort Of)** 




  





 We don’t care about specific frameworks. What matters is your ability to learn, build, and adapt faster than most. Examples of technologies and domains you may work with:
 



  





 •
 **Frontend** 
 → React, Vue, Angular, or custom dashboards for autonomous systems
 



 •
 **Backend** 
 → Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, microservices, APIs
 



 •
 **Cloud \\& Edge** 
 → AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, edge computing, IoT integration
 



 •
 **AI \\& ML** 
 → Computer vision, deep learning frameworks, reinforcement learning, sensor fusion, predictive analytics
 



 •
 **Autonomous Systems** 
 → Drone/robot fleet orchestration, real\\-time telemetry, event\\-driven pipelines
 



 •
 **Key focus** 
 : Build fast, ship faster, iterate with AI\\-enhanced efficiency, and maintain enterprise\\-grade reliability.
 



  





**What Makes You a Flyter** 




**Ownership Without Oversight** 
 → We trust you to deliver measurable outcomes, not just follow instructions.
 



**High Trust, High Candor** 
 → You give and receive feedback openly, speak up early, and embrace transparency.
 



**Velocity Over Perfection** 
 → You experiment, ship, and refine, balancing risk and reward.
 



**Full\\-Stack Execution** 
 → Job descriptions are guidelines, not limits. You take initiative across the stack.
 



**Joy in Complexity** 
 → You enjoy navigating messy problems, designing clarity, and scaling solutions.
 



**AI\\-First Mindset** 
 → You use AI and automation tools to amplify productivity and achieve 5–10x speed gains.
 



**Global Impact** 
 → You want your work to transform industries and redefine autonomous operations worldwide.
 



  





**What We Don't Want** 




 • Code jockeys who measure success in lines written, not value shipped.
 



 • Engineers who avoid understanding the product or user context.
 



 • People waiting for perfect specs instead of creating clarity themselves.
 



 • Anyone who says “that’s not my job” when faced with cross\\-stack challenges.
 



 • Folks who confuse long hours with meaningful progress.
 



  





**Why FlytBase?** 




 Because here, you won’t just write code—you’ll shape the future of autonomous robotics. You’ll work alongside a high\\-trust, high\\-candor team that values speed, learning, and ownership above all else. You’ll see your work deployed in mission\\-critical, real\\-world environments that actually matter.
