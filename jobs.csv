A proven low\\-code foundation combined with agentic AI and AI app generation capabilities empowers teams to move up to 10x faster with the assurance of security, scalability, and governance built in.
   

  

 As the future becomes agentic, our customers need us now more than ever. AI has opened the door to extraordinary possibilities—but inside the enterprise, things are moving fast and feeling chaotic. Some early adopters are making progress in production, but for many, AI tools are sprawling without governance, data isn’t ready, and talent isn’t there yet. Enterprises are still drowning in application backlogs and struggling with legacy systems. But with the right platform, AI doesn’t have to add to the chaos. It can become the breakthrough that brings clarity—and drives real, enterprise\\-wide impact. At OutSystems, we’ve built that platform, providing the tools necessary for enterprises to overcome these hurdles.
   

  

 We are looking for passionate, talented, and motivated people to join us in helping our customers build, deploy, and scale apps and agents—fast, helping them accelerate innovation while enabling secure, governed human\\-AI collaboration.
   

  

 OutSystems is a truly global company, with more than 850,000 developer community members, 1,700 employees, more than 500 partners, and thousands of active customers in over 75 countries and across 21 industries. Founded in 2001, OutSystems has offices in the United States, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal, Germany, the UAE, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Singapore, and of course has a thriving, worldwide community of remote employees.
   

  

 Amongst our customers are some of the world's most recognizable brands across diverse industries—brands like Toyota, Heineken, Bosch, KeyBank, and UCLA. These customers are the reason we have a 4\\.6 star rating on G2\\. Their success is ours, and their stories demonstrate tangible ROI and transformational impact. We are a 9x Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader for Low\\-Code Application Platforms and a multi\\-year leader in the Forrester Wave. We’re recognized not just as leaders but as visionaries with a strong ability to execute, now extending our leadership into the AI and agentic application development arena.
   

  

**Working at OutSystems**
 Our goal is to ensure that OutSystems is a place for bright, happy, and motivated people who share a common purpose and take pride in doing excellent work to pursue our vision of providing the AI\\-powered low\\-code development platform enterprise leaders trust to build, secure, and evolve their business applications, agents, and core systems. Our culture is focused on our core values of trust, customer success, innovation, and alignment. Our team members operate with transparency, integrity, and accountability, define success through the lens of the outcomes we deliver for our customers, push the boundaries with excellence, and work together toward our shared vision to deliver on what matters most.
   

  

**What do we have to offer you?**
* A company that is always growing, changing, and innovating. We challenge each other to innovate in our products, in our team, and how we use our own technology. And we give our teams space to be proactive and creative.
* Real career opportunities. We care about growth and development. Yes, vertical career progression is a possibility, but it's not the only one. From lateral moves and joining different teams to mastering specialized skills, we support your growth no matter what your goals are.

* Partner with product engineering, security architecture, and cloud infrastructure teams to embed secure design patterns and automation across private, public, and emerging AI\\-native clouds.
* Build secure cloud architecture and implement full\\-stack solutions—from backend APIs (Java/Spring Boot, Python) to observability portals, and security action workflows—delivering reliability, scalability, and operational excellence.
* Foster process\\-as\\-code leadership to transform manual workflows into consumable, automated self\\-service subscriptions to reduce software vulnerability exposures.
* Together, we evaluate new CSP and third\\-party security offerings, prototype custom solutions aligned with NVIDIA’s global standards, and continuously supervise environment posture through industry standard benchmarks, logging, and alerting.
* Build vulnerability assessment platforms to automate discovery, prioritization, and remediation workflows, employing AI models with dynamic risk analysis.


**What We Need To See**
* Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field with 8\\+ years' software development experience.
* Proven experience designing, developing, and deploying services on public or hybrid private\\-public cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI).
* Proficiency in Java (Spring Boot) and Python, with a strong grasp of scalable REST API development. Experience building front\\-end applications using React / Angular, TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML5/CSS. Knowledge of connecting UI and API for secure, high\\-performing systems.
* Experience implementing Infrastructure\\-as\\-Code (IaC), securing containerised and K8S environments (EKS, AKS, GKE, OKE), and integrating monitoring and alerting systems (Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, PagerDuty) for operational visibility.
* Proven understanding of authentication and authorization protocols (SSO, SAML, Federated Identity, RBAC, IAM policies) in multi\\-cloud environments to implement secure identity management practices.
* Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively across global engineering teams, driving secure production\\-grade solutions through clear communication and cross\\-functional teamwork.


**Ways To Stand Out From The Crowd**
* Bring experience with AI or ML pipelines, especially integration of automated or intelligent security controls—using AI to improve detection, response, or compliance capabilities.
* Demonstrate hands\\-on work with security and asset platforms, event streaming (Kafka, Pub/Sub), or large\\-scale data ingestion and analytics (Databricks, Delta Lake).
* Show comfort operating across multiple cloud service providers and hybrid or private environments, applying sophisticated observability, telemetry, and alerting techniques to strengthen security at scale.


 Above all, show curiosity, creativity, and a drive to make security smarter—because that’s what we do every day at NVIDIA! We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
