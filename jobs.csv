 Step 3\\. Talk to Jack so he can understand your experience and ambitions.
   

  

 Step 4\\. Jack will make sure Jill (the AI agent working for the company) considers you for this role.
   

  

 Step 5\\. If Jill thinks you're a great fit and her client wants to meet you, they will make the introduction.
   

  

 Step 6\\. If not, Jack will find you excellent alternatives. All for free.
   

  

**We never post fake jobs**
 This isn't a trick. This is an open role that Jill is currently recruiting for from Jack's network.
   

  

 Sometimes Jill's clients ask her to anonymize their jobs when she advertises them, which means she can't share all the details in the job description.
   

  

 We appreciate this can make them look a bit suspect, but there isn't much we can do about it.
   

  

 Give Jack a spin! You could land this role. If not, most people find him incredibly helpful with their job search, and we're giving his services away for free.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/jackandjillai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQHpkjLSnrBsZQ/company-logo_100_100/B4EZme9iNtIwAQ-/0/1759308555479/jackjill_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=fTtFR78cPwHzl-J8kEotEphWT8XfHVQJkBcyqrmkfQE","","","","","","","","","","",""
