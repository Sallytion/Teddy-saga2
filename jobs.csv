"li-4324325821","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4324325821","","PlayOps OpenGrid Fellowship (Dev)","PlayOps","Gurugram, Haryana, India","","fulltime","","","","","",True,"mid-senior level","Research, Analyst, and Information Technology","","","**The Invitation** 




 The Feed erased effort. The Grid was left unfinished — fragments of a code base buried in the collapse. Whoever built it didn’t leave instructions, only proof that it could be rebuilt through action.
 



 The Open Grid Fellowship is a selective 12\\-week program for experienced full\\-stack and open source developers. It begins inside the PlayOps ARG: daily missions in Telegram, 30–60 minutes a day, XP receipts for every proof of action. By the second month, your contributions evolve into real system builds — open validators, prototypes, and templates that define how the Grid works.
 



 This is not a job. It’s authorship in a system that outlives résumés. XP is sweat equity. Your receipts today become your stake tomorrow.
 



  





**What You’ll Do** 



* Enter the daily rhythm: 30–60 min Telegram missions, proof submissions, XP multipliers.
* Transition into system building: sketches → prototypes → working validators.
* Collaborate globally with players, storytellers, and builders.
* Leave behind open source templates used worldwide.



  





**Who We’re Looking For** 




 This track is not entry\\-level. It’s for builders who already ship code and contribute in the open.
 


* Full\\-stack developers comfortable moving between front\\-end, back\\-end, and data.
* Open source contributors who understand authorship \\+ collaboration.
* Devs who can translate fragments into systems with minimal guidance.
* Problem\\-solvers who thrive in ambiguity and want to author infrastructure, not just features.



  





**Why Join** 



* Your builds are featured in a global documentary \\+ Roku episodic series.
* Your validators launch as open templates used worldwide.
* Every action is logged as a receipt of authorship.
* XP is sweat equity in the Grid — unlocking future token rewards.
* Build inside a living ARG where story and system are inseparable.



  





**Requirements** 



* Demonstrated experience in full\\-stack development (front\\-end \\+ back\\-end).
* Prior contributions to open source projects.
* Strong command of JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, and one major framework (React, Node, or equivalent).
* Must have Telegram \\+ LinkedIn accounts.
* Comfortable reading \\+ typing in English (all text\\-based).
* Commit 30–60 minutes daily for 12 weeks (remote \\+ global).



  





**Compensation** 




 This is a fellowship, not a salary role. You’ll leave with:
 


* Authorship in validators and open templates.
* A builder profile with XP, badges, and skill scores.
* Credit in the PlayOps documentary.
* XP receipts that unlock tokenized rewards later.

**What’s MyARC?**
 The future of fitness is creator centric and MyARC is building the operating system for it.
   

  

 The online fitness market is set to hit $60bn by 2027, and fitness content creators with their huge fan bases are best positioned to capture this. They just don’t have
   

  

 the tools for it.
   

  

 A creator with 100k\\+ followers can only train \\~30 clients using today’s solutions, because they need to manually personalise each workout for each client. That’s
   

  

 why online coaching costs anywhere between $500\\-$1,000/month for consumers. It’s not scalable for creators as assistant coaches need to be hired nor
   

  

 is it affordable for fans. That’s where MyARC comes in.
   

  

 We automatically personalise generic training plans to any individual user’s needs. This means one creator can now train unlimited fans, providing creators with a scalable business model that doesn’t require an army of coaches, and fans get affordable personalised fitness with price coming down from $1,000/month to $20/month.
   

  

 Already, we’ve taken creators from minimum wage to 6\\-figure earnings and we’re on track to create MyARC millionaires on the platform. There are 1000s of users
   

  

 around the world with serious health transformations ranging from users overcoming obesity and coming out of a diabetic state, to cancer survivors
   

  

 gaining muscle for the first time.
   

  

 MyARC democratises personalised fitness for consumers and economically empowers creators.
   

  

**What’s my part in this?**
 TLDR \\- we are growing rapidly and have an ambitious roadmap to build an industry leading product.
   

  

 We’re looking for a full stack engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset to join the mission on a long\\-term basis. You’ll play a key role in the development and
   

  

 maintenance of our mobile and web apps. The ideal candidate will have expertise in Expo React Native, React, and Next.js, along with experience in building
   

  

 consumer\\-facing media\\-rich applications. If you’ve got experience with Django, DRF, and Python, that’s a bonus.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
 🔑 Building Great Products at Lightning Speed: Show initiative and take pride in completely owning your work. You’ll be on the front line, writing code that will be
   

  

 directly deployed to production in days, not weeks, and directly contributing to thousands of users’ lives.
   

  

 🔑 Working Autonomously in an Unstructured Team: Working directly with the founders and the rest of the engineering team to build scalable product and
   

  

 execute on the ambitious roadmap. You’ll need to be comfortable working in small, unstructured teams with changing priorities.
   

  

 🔑 Uphold Quality Standards: Write clean, maintainable, testable code that can easily be refactored and extended as business requirements adapt.

**What’s MyARC?**
 The future of fitness is creator centric and MyARC is building the operating system for it.
   

  

 The online fitness market is set to hit $60bn by 2027, and fitness content creators with their huge fan bases are best positioned to capture this. They just don’t have
   

  

 the tools for it.
   

  

 A creator with 100k\\+ followers can only train \\~30 clients using today’s solutions, because they need to manually personalise each workout for each client. That’s
   

  

 why online coaching costs anywhere between $500\\-$1,000/month for consumers. It’s not scalable for creators as assistant coaches need to be hired nor
   

  

 is it affordable for fans. That’s where MyARC comes in.
   

  

 We automatically personalise generic training plans to any individual user’s needs. This means one creator can now train unlimited fans, providing creators with a scalable business model that doesn’t require an army of coaches, and fans get affordable personalised fitness with price coming down from $1,000/month to $20/month.
   

  

 Already, we’ve taken creators from minimum wage to 6\\-figure earnings and we’re on track to create MyARC millionaires on the platform. There are 1000s of users
   

  

 around the world with serious health transformations ranging from users overcoming obesity and coming out of a diabetic state, to cancer survivors
   

  

 gaining muscle for the first time.
   

  

 MyARC democratises personalised fitness for consumers and economically empowers creators.
   

  

**What’s my part in this?**
 TLDR \\- we are growing rapidly and have an ambitious roadmap to build an industry leading product.
   

  

 We’re looking for a full stack engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset to join the mission on a long\\-term basis. You’ll play a key role in the development and
   

  

 maintenance of our mobile and web apps. The ideal candidate will have expertise in Expo React Native, React, and Next.js, along with experience in building
   

  

 consumer\\-facing media\\-rich applications. If you’ve got experience with Django, DRF, and Python, that’s a bonus.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
 🔑 Building Great Products at Lightning Speed: Show initiative and take pride in completely owning your work. You’ll be on the front line, writing code that will be
   

  

 directly deployed to production in days, not weeks, and directly contributing to thousands of users’ lives.
   

  

 🔑 Working Autonomously in an Unstructured Team: Working directly with the founders and the rest of the engineering team to build scalable product and
   

  

 execute on the ambitious roadmap. You’ll need to be comfortable working in small, unstructured teams with changing priorities.
   

  

 🔑 Uphold Quality Standards: Write clean, maintainable, testable code that can easily be refactored and extended as business requirements adapt.
