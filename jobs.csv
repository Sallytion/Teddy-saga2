**About Rippling Payroll** 




 Rippling Payroll is redefining how companies pay their people across the world — turning payroll from a cost center into a strategic advantage. Built on Rippling Unity — our unified workforce platform — Payroll connects HR, IT, and Finance so every policy, approval, and pay calculation automatically stays in sync across systems and countries.
 



 With $750M\\+ ARR, \\>23,000 customers, and \\>$70B in annualized payroll volume, we’re building the most intelligent, automated, and compliant payroll infrastructure on the planet.
 



  





**The Opportunity** 




 We’re looking for a
 **Principal Engineer (P10\\)** 
 to help architect and scale Rippling’s
 **next\\-generation Global Payroll Platform** 
 — a system that powers payments, compliance, and computation for millions of employees across 50\\+ countries.
 



 This role sits at the intersection of
 **AI\\-powered automation** 
 ,
 **compliance\\-as\\-code** 
 , and
 **massive scale** 
 — with direct ownership over core systems that define how Rippling processes global payroll, taxes, and payments at sub\\-second latency and near\\-zero error tolerance.
 



  





**What You’ll Own** 



* **Architect Rippling’s next\\-gen Payroll computation engine** 
 — modular, extensible, and capable of encoding multi\\-jurisdictional compliance logic declaratively.
* **Design data models and pipelines** 
 that handle versioned pay runs, audit trails, retroactive corrections, and time\\-based computations at global scale.
* **Build scalable rules engines** 
 to automate ever\\-changing tax, benefits, and labor laws across jurisdictions, ensuring compliance through dynamic, AI\\-generated logic.
* **Modernize global payment infrastructure** 
 for real\\-time or near\\-instant disbursements while balancing reconciliation, fraud detection, and regulatory constraints.
* **Evolve reporting and permissions systems** 
 to deliver real\\-time insights and granular access controls for complex, multi\\-entity organizations.
* **Partner with Product, Compliance, and Finance** 
 teams to convert ambiguous regulatory specs into clear, deterministic system behavior.
* **Lead high\\-impact initiatives** 
 like sandboxed “simulation” payrolls, AI\\-powered paystub explainability, and what\\-if analysis for enterprises.
* **Shape the long\\-term platform vision** 
 , influencing 150\\+ engineers across Finance and HR Infrastructure as a multiplier, mentor, and architectural authority.



  





**What Success Looks Like** 



* **System Reliability:** 
 Sub\\-second computation accuracy for global pay runs, with zero critical compliance defects.
* **Extensibility:** 
 New countries, pay types, and tax rules added with minimal engineering overhead.
* **Performance:** 
 Orders of magnitude improvement in latency and cost efficiency across distributed computation.
* **Developer Velocity:** 
 Simplified APIs, testing frameworks, and onboarding for internal and partner developers.
* **Business Impact:** 
 Reduction in country onboarding time, payroll failure rates, and manual compliance interventions.



  





**What We’re Looking For** 



* 18\\+ years of experience building large\\-scale distributed systems in high\\-compliance or high\\-integrity domains (Finance, Payroll, Tax, Insurance, etc.).
* Deep expertise in
 **data architecture** 
 ,
 **domain\\-driven design** 
 , and
 **rule\\-based / event\\-driven systems** 
 .
* Experience scaling
 **compliance\\-heavy, multi\\-country systems** 
 — ideally payroll, tax, or financial computation platforms.
* Proficiency in designing
 **modular service boundaries** 
 , ensuring backward compatibility and auditability.
* Strong understanding of
 **computation correctness** 
 ,
 **versioned state** 
 ,
 **precision handling** 
 , and
 **retroactive adjustments** 
 .
* Proven ability to partner across functions — translating legal/compliance constraints into elegant, maintainable systems.
* A strong architectural voice who can both
 *design systems* 
 and
 *mentor teams* 
 to scale them sustainably.



  





**Bonus Points** 



* Experience with
 **AI\\-driven system automation** 
 or
 **compliance\\-as\\-code** 
 frameworks.
* Hands\\-on work with
 **global payroll systems** 
 ,
 **real\\-time payments** 
 , or
 **statutory tax logic** 
 .
* Familiarity with
 **event sourcing** 
 ,
 **CQRS** 
 ,
 **streaming pipelines** 
 , and
 **immutable data stores** 
 .
* Contributions to open\\-source distributed computation frameworks or rule engines.



  





**Why Rippling** 



* Backed by
 **world\\-class investors (Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, Bedrock, GIC, Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs)**
* Valued among the
 **fastest\\-growing SaaS companies** 
 in history
* Build at the heart of Rippling’s
