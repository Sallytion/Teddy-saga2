Headquartered in California with a fast\\-moving engineering base in Pune, FlytBase is redefining how the physical world is monitored and managed. The company operates at AI speed, with autonomy and intelligence at its core. At FlytBase, teams work in a high\\-agency, high\\-velocity environment where AI isn’t a side project—it’s the operating system for how they think, build, and grow.
 



  





 With 300\\+ global deployments and 50\\+ partners in our ecosystem, FlytBase is powering the shift from human\\-operated to self\\-driven skies. Our platform transforms off\\-the\\-shelf drones into intelligent systems that sync effortlessly with enterprise infrastructure.
 



  





**The Role** 




 We’re not looking for “traditional” developers.
 



 We’re looking for AI\\-native builders who leverage modern dev tools to ship in weeks what used to take months.
 



 This role is about building real products—front\\-end, back\\-end, cloud, edge—using AI copilots, automation pipelines, and rapid prototyping workflows. You won’t be training ML models, but you’ll be using AI to code smarter, faster, and better.
 



 If you thrive on velocity, ownership, and creating software that actually runs on robots and drones in the real world, this role is for you.
 



  





**What You'll Own** 




**2\\+ Years of experience in Full\\-Stack Product Developmen** 
 t → Build, test, and ship features end\\-to\\-end across UI, backend, and cloud/edge.
 



**AI\\-Native Coding** 
 → Use AI tools to accelerate development, reduce boilerplate, and focus on high\\-value problem solving.
 



**Rapid Prototyping** 
 → Turn ideas into working prototypes fast, iterate with feedback, and ship production\\-ready solutions.
 



**Cross\\-Stack Problem Solving** 
 → Jump between frontend, backend, edge, and integrations without silos.
 



**High\\-Velocity Execution** 
 → Operate at startup speed while maintaining enterprise\\-grade reliability.
 



  





**Best Suited For** 



* **AI\\-First Developer** 
 → You already use tools like Cursor, Copilot, Replit, or Lovable daily to accelerate shipping.
* **Full\\-Stack Builder** 
 → Comfortable moving across frontend, backend, cloud, and integrations.
* **Problem\\-First, Tool\\-Agnosti** 
 c → You pick the right tool for the job, not the trendy one.
* **Outcome\\-Oriented** 
 → You measure success in features shipped, not hours logged.
* **Owner’s Mindset** 
 → You own your code, bugs, and features end\\-to\\-end.



  





**Our Stack (Flexible)** 




  





 We don’t care about rigid tech stacks—we care about velocity. You’ll likely touch:
 


* **Frontend** 
 → React, Vue, Angular, or custom dashboards
* **Backend** 
 → Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, microservices, APIs
* **Cloud \\& Edge** 
 → AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, IoT integration
* **Workflows** 
 → AI coding assistants, automation pipelines, testing frameworks



  





**What Makes You a Flyter** 




 • You code with AI tools by default, not as an afterthought
 



 • You thrive on speed: prototype → feedback → production
 



 • You don’t say “that’s not my stack”—you cross boundaries
 



 • You prefer messy, high\\-impact problems over neat, trivial ones
 



 • You want your work running on fleets of drones \\& robots worldwide
 



  





**What We Don't Want** 




 • Code jockeys who measure success in lines written, not value shipped.
 



 • Engineers who avoid understanding the product or user context.
 



 • People waiting for perfect specs instead of creating clarity themselves.
 



 • Anyone who says “that’s not my job” when faced with cross\\-stack challenges.
 



 • Folks who confuse long hours with meaningful progress.
 



  





**Why FlytBase?** 




 • Because here, you won’t just “write code.”
 



 • You’ll redefine what it means to develop software in the AI\\-native era.
 



 • You’ll see your work deployed in mission\\-critical, real\\-world operations across industries. And you’ll do it with a team that values ownership, candor, and velocity.
 



  





**The Perks** 




 • Competitive compensation and performance bonuses.
 



 • AI\\-first workflows and cutting\\-edge dev tools.
 



 • Flexible work hours with core on\\-site collaboration in Pune.
 



 • Direct impact on a product used globally in high\\-stakes operations.
 



 • Unlimited paid time off.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/flytbase","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQGcBC7oUTRGLg/company-logo_100_100/B4DZq1OZZzIEAQ-/0/1763977044434/flytbase_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0qaVV6Na6WsZW_-hiu7GgGpm6PKQZqS1BhrSKl8SpC4","","","","","","","","","","",""
