 Roku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension).

**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

**Procedure is hiring for Drover.**
*This is not a DevOps/SRE/cloud\\-migration role — this is a hands\\-on backend engineering and architecture role where you build the platform powering our hardware at scale.*
**About Drover**
 Ranching is getting harder. Increased labor costs and a volatile climate are placing mounting pressure to provide for a growing population. Drover is
 *empowering ranchers to efficiently and sustainably feed the world* 
 by making it cheaper and easier to manage livestock, unlock productivity gains, and reduce carbon footprint with rotational grazing. Not only is this a $46B opportunity, you'll be working on a climate solution with the potential for real, meaningful impact.
   

  

 We use
 ***patent\\-pending low\\-voltage electrical muscle stimulation (EMS)***
 to steer and contain cows, replacing the need for physical fences or electric shock. We are building something that has never been done before, and we have hundreds of ranches on our waitlist.
   

  

 Drover is founded by
 **Callum Taylor** 
 (ex\\-Harvard), who comes from 5 generations of ranching, and
 **Samuel Aubin** 
 , both of whom grew up in Australian ranching towns and have an intricate understanding of the problem space. We are well\\-funded and supported by Workshop Ventures, a VC firm with experience in building unicorn IoT companies.
   

  

 We're looking to assemble a team of exceptional talent with a high eagerness to dive headfirst into understanding the challenges and opportunities within ranching.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As our
 **founding cloud engineer** 
 , you will be responsible for building and scaling the infrastructure that powers our IoT platform, connecting thousands of devices across ranches nationwide.
   

  

 Because we are an
 *early\\-stage startup* 
 , you will have
 **high levels of ownership** 
 in what you build. You will play a pivotal part in architecting our cloud infrastructure, building robust APIs, and ensuring our systems can scale reliably. We are looking for someone who is excited about solving complex technical challenges at the intersection of IoT, agriculture, and cloud computing.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* Develop Drover IoT cloud architecture from the ground up (it’s a green field project)
* Design and implement services to support wearable devices, mobile app, and backend API
* Implement data processing and storage pipelines
* Create and maintain Infrastructure\\-as\\-Code
* Support the engineering team across all aspects of early\\-stage development \\-\\- after all, this is a startup


**Requirements**
* 5\\+ years of experience developing cloud architecture on AWS
* In\\-depth understanding of IoT domain
* Expertise in cloud\\-hosted, event\\-driven, serverless architectures
* Expertise in programming languages suitable for AWS micro\\-services (ex: TypeScript, Python)
* Experience with networking and socket programming
* Experience with Kubernetes or similar orchestration platforms
* Experience with Infrastructure\\-as\\-Code tools (e.g., Terraform, AWS CDK)
* Familiarity with relational databases (PostgreSQL)
