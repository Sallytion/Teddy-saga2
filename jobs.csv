 via the
 **Model Context Protocol (MCP).**
* **Deploy at scale** 
 — design serverless agent platforms using
 **AgentCore/Gateway** 
 , integrate tools (REST APIs, MCP servers), and build event\\-driven systems with
 **API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and Kinesis.**

* You think beyond code — about latency, cost, observability, and performance — and you design systems that are as elegant as they are efficient
* You understand that great agents don't just
 *work* 
 — they
 *improve* 
 . You know how to design feedback loops, fine\\-tune reasoning, and measure outcomes.
* You have implemented
 **RAG pipelines** 
 ,
 **knowledge graphs** 
 ,
 **vector stores** 
 to power contextual memory and smarter decision\\-making into Agentic AI solution

* **Collaborate \\& Ideate:**
 If selected, you'll join a
 **live workshop** 
 with our AI leadership team to explore a real\\-world
 **agent architecture scenario** 
 — we'll look for your ability to reason, design, and iterate under open\\-ended, high\\-impact conditions
