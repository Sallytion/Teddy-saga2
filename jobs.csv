At Atlan, we’re changing that. As the world’s first active metadata platform, we help organisations transform data chaos into clarity and seamless collaboration.
   

  

 From Fortune 500 leaders to hyper\\-growth startups, from automotive innovators redefining mobility to healthcare organisations saving lives, and from Wall Street powerhouses to Silicon Valley trailblazers — we empower ambitious teams across industries to unlock the full potential of their data.
   

  

 Recognised as leaders by Gartner and Forrester and backed by Insight Partners, Atlan is at the forefront of reimagining how humans and data work together. Joining us means becoming part of a movement to shape a future where data drives extraordinary outcomes.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Atlan is building the next generation of its
 **App Framework** 
 , a foundation for developers to orchestrate the extraction, transformation, and loading of metadata from diverse data sources into Atlan’s context store. This modern platform is powered by intelligent apps for publishing, lineage computation, and state diffs, so developers building source\\-specific apps can focus on what truly matters: extracting and enriching metadata from sources..
   

  

 As an
 **App Developer** 
 , you’ll be at the heart of this evolution. You’ll collaborate closely with product managers to understand source\\-specific requirements, curate sandbox environments for development and testing, and use Python to build robust, high\\-quality metadata extraction apps. You’ll dive deep into APIs, protocols, and schemas to surface metadata efficiently, whether via batch jobs or event\\-driven flows.
   

  

 In addition to source apps, you’ll also have the opportunity to work on intelligent apps themselves — the building blocks that power publishing, lineage computation, and state diffing across our ecosystem. Looking ahead, we’re also building AI agents on top of the app framework, unlocking automation and intelligence for metadata ingestion.
   

  

 This is your chance to shape how metadata from hundreds of tools flows into Atlan, while contributing to a PaaS\\-enabled SaaS ecosystem built for developer delight.
   

  

**What will you do? 🤔**
* Build metadata extraction apps for a wide range of databases, SaaS tools, and data systems using Atlan’s App Framework.
* Work with product managers to refine requirements and define what metadata should be extracted and how it’s modeled.
* Explore and connect to sources via APIs, SDKs, and database connectors.
* Write clean, maintainable Python code, leveraging framework abstractions for publishing, lineage computation, and state diffing.
* Test and validate extraction logic using sandboxes and mock environments.
* Contribute to a culture of observability, logging, and structured debugging to ensure metadata flows are reliable.
* Collaborate with the App Framework team to suggest improvements, spot abstraction gaps, and shape the developer experience.


**What makes you a match? 😍**
* Strong fluency in databases — comfortable writing SQL across multiple dialects, with a solid grasp of NoSQL concepts and how schemas evolve across systems.
* A strong grasp of APIs and protocols — HTTP/REST fundamentals, authentication (OAuth2, API keys), pagination, and working with JSON/XML payloads; familiarity with GraphQL is a plus.
* Solid programming skills — writing clean, maintainable scripts and modules, using async patterns where needed, and incorporating tests and logging into your work.
* Good habits around testing, debugging, and observability — writing unit tests, using structured logs, and validating extraction logic in sandboxed environments.
* Curiosity around AI tools — willing to leverage AI to accelerate coding, debugging, and documentation.
* Collaborative mindset to work closely with product managers to clarify requirements and ensure metadata extraction aligns with product goals.


**Why Is Atlan for You?**
 At Atlan, we believe the future belongs to the humans of data. From curing diseases to advancing space exploration, data teams are powering humanity's greatest achievements. Yet, working with data can be chaotic—our mission is to transform that experience. We're reimagining how data teams collaborate by building the home they deserve, enabling them to create winning data cultures and drive meaningful progress.
   

  

**Joining Atlan Means**
* Ownership from Day One: Whether you're an intern or a full\\-time teammate, you’ll own impactful projects, chart your growth, and collaborate with some of the best minds in the industry.
* Limitless Opportunities: At Atlan, your growth has no boundaries. If you’re ready to take initiative, the sky’s the limit.
* A Global Data Community: We’re deeply embedded in the modern data stack, contributing to open\\-source projects, sponsoring meet\\-ups, and empowering team members to grow through conferences and learning opportunities.


 As a fast\\-growing, fully remote company trusted by global leaders like Cisco, Nasdaq, and HubSpot, we’re creating a category\\-defining platform for data and AI governance. Backed by top investors, we’ve achieved 7X revenue growth in two years and are building a talented team spanning 15\\+ countries.
   

  

 If you’re ready to do your life’s best work and help shape the future of data collaboration, join Atlan and become part of a mission to empower the humans of data to achieve more, together.
   

  

**We are an equal opportunity employer**
 At Atlan, we’re committed to helping data teams do their lives’ best work. We believe that diversity and authenticity are the cornerstones of innovation, and by embracing varied perspectives and experiences, we can create a workplace where everyone thrives.
