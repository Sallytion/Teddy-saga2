**About Drover**
 Ranching is getting harder. Increased labor costs and a volatile climate are placing mounting pressure to provide for a growing population. Drover is
 *empowering ranchers to efficiently and sustainably feed the world* 
 by making it cheaper and easier to manage livestock, unlock productivity gains, and reduce carbon footprint with rotational grazing. Not only is this a $46B opportunity, you'll be working on a climate solution with the potential for real, meaningful impact.
   

  

 We use
 ***patent\\-pending low\\-voltage electrical muscle stimulation (EMS)***

**About The Role**
 As our
 **founding cloud engineer** 
 , you will be responsible for building and scaling the infrastructure that powers our IoT platform, connecting thousands of devices across ranches nationwide.
   

  

 Because we are an
 *early\\-stage startup* 
 , you will have
 **high levels of ownership** 
 in what you build. You will play a pivotal part in architecting our cloud infrastructure, building robust APIs, and ensuring our systems can scale reliably. We are looking for someone who is excited about solving complex technical challenges at the intersection of IoT, agriculture, and cloud computing.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* Develop Drover IoT cloud architecture from the ground up (it’s a green field project)
* Design and implement services to support wearable devices, mobile app, and backend API
* Implement data processing and storage pipelines
* Create and maintain Infrastructure\\-as\\-Code
* Support the engineering team across all aspects of early\\-stage development \\-\\- after all, this is a startup


**Requirements**
* 5\\+ years of experience developing cloud architecture on AWS
* In\\-depth understanding of various AWS services, especially those related to IoT
* Expertise in cloud\\-hosted, event\\-driven, serverless architectures
* Expertise in programming languages suitable for AWS micro\\-services (ex: TypeScript, Python)
* Experience with networking and socket programming
* Experience with Kubernetes or similar orchestration platforms
* Experience with Infrastructure\\-as\\-Code tools (e.g., Terraform, AWS CDK)
* Familiarity with relational databases (PostgreSQL)
