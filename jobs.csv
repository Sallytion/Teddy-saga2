 AED 15,000 \\- AED 20,000 per month \\+ Up to 10% Performance Bonus
 



**Total Annual Package:** 
 Up to AED 282,000 (Tax\\-Free)
 



**The Reality:** 
 Dubai \\= 0% personal income tax. Your offer is your take\\-home.
 



 (In most major markets, 30\\-50% goes to taxes. Here, 100% of what we offer is what you keep)
 



**Location:** 
 Dubai, UAE (On\\-site) with relocation assistance and visa support
 



  





**Role Overview** 




 We're seeking an innovative AI Workflow Specialist to join our dynamic team at the forefront of internal innovation.
 



  





 You'll design and deploy high\\-impact AI projects to optimize and automate workflows across the entire organization. You'll work cross\\-functionally to identify automation opportunities, translate business needs into powerful AI solutions, and empower teams to work more efficiently—driving operational excellence and leveraging cutting\\-edge AI to solve real\\-world business problems.
 



  





**The Career Accelerator** 




 You'll build more end\\-to\\-end workflow automations in your first few months than most specialists build in several. You'll design systems that touch every department—finance, marketing, operations, HR—building execution instincts through sheer volume that takes others years to develop. This pace energizes impatient high\\-performers. If you get frustrated when you're not learning fast enough, you'll thrive here.
 



  





**What Is In It For You:** 




 This isn't just another workflow automation role. This is your chance to become a true industry architect.
 



  





**1\\. Become the AI Automation Architect for an Entire Organization** 




 Most automation specialists optimize one department or maintain existing systems. You'll architect AI\\-powered workflows across the entire company—finance, marketing, operations, HR, customer service. You'll conduct discovery sessions with department heads, translate complex business needs into AI configurations, and deploy solutions that transform how teams work. You'll master Claude projects, n8n, make.com, and emerging AI platforms in production environments. While others debate AI's potential, you'll be building the automation infrastructure that becomes the competitive advantage.

Enjoy premium healthcare, annual flights home, international team collaboration across multiple nationalities, and a lifestyle that blends career acceleration with quality of life. Dubai isn't just a location—it's a competitive advantage for your career and finances.
 



  





**4\\. Build the Automation Playbook Others Will Study** 




 You're not inheriting workflows to maintain—you're creating the automation frameworks that define how modern organizations operate. Your workflow templates become company\\-wide standards. Your AI integrations solve problems other companies haven't even identified yet. Your documentation trains entire teams on AI\\-native work. In two years, operations leaders will be studying the systems you built here.
 



  





**What You'll Need:** 



* 2\\-3 years of experience in workflow automation, process optimization, operations, or a similar role focused on systematic problem\\-solving
* Proven experience designing and building complex workflows using AI\\-native or no\\-code/low\\-code platforms (e.g., Claude, n8n, make.com, Zapier)
* Exceptional logical reasoning and problem\\-solving abilities, with a proven talent for translating business needs into technical solutions
* A high degree of curiosity for AI and a passion for finding innovative solutions to business challenges
* Excellent communication and documentation skills, with the ability to effectively train and support non\\-technical teams



  





**Good\\-to\\-Have:** 



* A knack for identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues within automated workflows
* Basic understanding of how APIs and webhooks work to connect different applications
* Experience creating diagrams or flowcharts to map out a process before building it
