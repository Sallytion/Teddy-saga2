You understand and apply best practice within Tesco and across the industry.
   

  

**You will be responsible for**
 My impact reaches across the team in which I work. I provide technical leadership of medium to large features, participating in their design and taking accountability for their delivery. I am comfortable implementing and shipping end\\-to\\-end stories and am starting to understand the deeper problems in my part of the business. I am likely to be considered an expert in a specific part of my domain.
   

 This is the first level at which I do more than complete the work that’s been assigned to me: I am starting to build and prioritise my own work by understanding the problems my team faces and proposing, implementing, and delivering solutions to them. I am aware of the short\\-term and long\\-term goals across my product. I work within my team, utilising data driven decision making techniques, to encouraging optimal outcomes whilst accepting appropriate trade\\-offs.
   

 I am comfortable both supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on major components or small services as appropriate. At this level I display a degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team and am experienced enough to know when I need support. I am able to identify risks and raise these as appropriate.
   

 At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team.
   

 I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code.
   

 I have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing these within my team.
   

 I am comfortable working in a group context and am capable of communicating technical concepts to key stakeholders.

 You can read code to understand where the bugs are likely hiding.
* **You are a Quality Advocate:** 
 You are comfortable challenging implementations when quality or user experience is at risk.
* **You are AI\\-Curious:** 
 You stay updated on the latest in LLMs and agentic frameworks.
