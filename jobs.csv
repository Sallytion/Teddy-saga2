* Improving performance on current and next\\-generation GPU architectures by conducting in\\-depth analysis and end\\-to\\-end optimization of AI models, data processing pipelines, and inference runtime features.
* Identifying, evaluating, and implementing compute and memory optimization techniques—such as quantization, distillation, and pruning—for large AI models; fine\\-tuning and compressing models to fit edge devices.


**What We Need To See**
* Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Mathematics, or a related field (or equivalent experience).
* Excellent C\\+\\+ programming and debugging skills with a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms.
* 5\\+ years of experience with proficiency in AI inferencing pipelines and applications using ML/DL frameworks like ONNX RT, DirectML, PyTorch, Tensor RT.
* Strong analytical and problem\\-solving abilities, with the ability to multitask effectively in a dynamic environment.
* Outstanding written and oral communication skills enabling effective collaboration with management and engineering teams.


**Ways To Stand Out From The Crowd**
* Understanding modern techniques in Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks, and Generative AI with relevant contributions to major open\\-source projects will be a plus.
* Consistent track record of delivering end\\-to\\-end products with geographically distributed teams in multinational product companies.
