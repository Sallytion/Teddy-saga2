**About the Role** 




 We are looking for a highly skilled
 **Senior AI Platform QA Engineer** 
 to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and performance of our AI\\-based patent platform. You won't just follow test cases; you will ""break"" systems, analyze Next.js code flows, and validate complex LLM agentic workflows.
 



 This role requires a unique blend of
 **Full\\-Stack technical QA** 
 (Next.js, APIs, Databases) and
 **AI/LLM testing** 
 (RAG, Prompt Engineering, Hallucination detection). You will act as a quality gatekeeper, thinking like a developer to identify architectural flaws before they reach production.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities** 




**1\\. Full\\-Stack \\& Architecture Testing** 



* **Next.js Frontend:** 
 Perform deep functional and integration testing. Analyze components, hooks, and state management to identify SSR/CSR edge cases and performance bottlenecks.

**2\\. AI \\& LLM Module Validation** 



* **Patent Search \\& RAG:** 
 Validate relevancy ranking, vector search accuracy, and the quality of retrieved context.
* **Agent Workflows:** 
 Test LLM\\-powered multi\\-step agents for autonomy behaviors, ""looping"" issues, and edge\\-case handling.
* **Model Evaluation:** 
 Evaluate outputs for hallucinations, factual accuracy (specifically for patent law), and consistency using tools like OpenAI/Ollama.
* **Fine\\-Tuning Pipelines:** 
 Validate datasets and monitor training runs to benchmark model performance.



**3\\. Quality Ownership \\& Engineering** 



* **Code Review:** 
 Review frontend and backend code from a testability perspective, identifying anti\\-patterns and suggesting better error handling.
* **Test Design:** 
 Write scalable, reusable test cases for complex multi\\-user workflows.
* **Production Readiness:** 
 Validate logging, monitoring, and failover recovery. Analyze real\\-world failure scenarios and production bugs.

* **Experience:** 
 3–6 years in QA Engineering, with significant experience in
 **Full\\-Stack web applications.**
* **Frontend Mastery:** 
 Deep understanding of
 **Next.js/React**

* **Backend \\& API:** 
 Expert at testing APIs (Postman, curl) and understanding
 **Node.js/Python** 
 logic.
* **AI Knowledge:** 
 Hands\\-on experience with:
* **LLMs:** 
 OpenAI API, Ollama, or local model orchestration.
* **Vector Tech:** 
 RAG pipelines and vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.).
* **Prompt Engineering:** 
 Ability to identify issues with prompts and agentic logic.
* **Testing Mindset:** 
 Proven ability to test for concurrency, race conditions, and system\\-level failures.
* **Tools:** 
 Proficiency in Jira/TestRail and exposure to automation frameworks like
 **Playwright, Cypress, or PyTest.**
* **JIRA \\+ Confluence exposure must.**

* Experience with
 **Docker, CI/CD pipelines,** 
 and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP).
* Experience with
 **LLM evaluation frameworks** 
 (e.g., RAGAS, DeepEval).
* Performance/Load testing exposure using tools like k6 or Locust.



  





**What We Expect From You** 



* **You are a System Breaker:** 
 You don't just test features; you look for ways the system might fail under stress.
* **You Think Like a Developer:** 
 You can read code to understand where the bugs are likely hiding.
* **You are a Quality Advocate:** 
 You are comfortable challenging implementations when quality or user experience is at risk.
* **You are AI\\-Curious:** 
 You stay updated on the latest in LLMs and agentic frameworks.



  





**What We Offer** 



* Opportunity to work at the intersection of
 **Generative AI** 
 and
 **LegalTech.**
* A highly technical environment where QA is treated as an engineering discipline.
* Freedom to explore and implement new testing methodologies for AI.","IT Services and IT Consulting, IT System Testing and Evaluation, and IT System Data Services","https://in.linkedin.com/company/meril","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQHdsSopU_HYFw/company-logo_100_100/B4DZn2FzI9HsAQ-/0/1760770343571/meril_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Ylwcf2aozsk0MoH-UBD1myyk8wm3X5G2EzwnjRmWjeM","","","","","","","","","","",""
