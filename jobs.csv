 At DevRev, we’re building the future of work with
 **Computer** 
 – your AI teammate.
   

  

 Computer is not just another tool. It’s built on the belief that the future of work should be about genuine human connection and collaboration – not piling on more apps.
   

  

 Computer is the best kind of teammate: it amplifies your strengths, takes repetition and frustration out of your day, and gives you more time and energy to do your best work.
   

  

 How?
   

  

 Easy: it’s the only platform capable of…
   

  

**Complete data unification**
 Most AI products focus on either structured data (like CRM records and support tickets), or unstructured data (like documents and emails). Computer AirSync connects everything, unifying all your data sources (like Google Workspace, Jira, Notion) into one AI\\-ready source of truth: Computer Memory.
   

  

**Powerful search, reasoning, and action**
 Once connected to all your tools and apps, Computer is embedded in your full business context. It can find and summarize, sure. Even more impressive: it offers employees insights, strategic and proactive suggestions, plus powerful agentic actions.
   

  

**Extensions for your teams and customers**
 Computer doesn’t make you choose between new software and old. Its AI\\-native platform lets you extend existing tools with sophisticated apps and agents. So your teams – and your customers – can take action, seamlessly. These agents work alongside you: updating workflows, coordinating across teams, and syncing back to your systems.
   

  

 This isn’t just software. Computer brings
 *people* 
 back together, breaking down silos and ushering in the future of teamwork, through human\\-AI collaboration. Stop managing software. Stop wasting time. Start solving bigger problems, building better products, and making your customers happier.
