* Collaborate closely with product, design, and AI teams to ensure experiences feel safe, calm, and human.
* Test, iterate, and refine UI interactions to reduce friction and hesitation for users.
* Participate in reviews focused on clarity, accessibility, and emotional impact, and not just functionality.

* Exposure to AI products, conversational interfaces, or community platforms.
* Understanding of accessibility, UX writing, or human\\-centered design.
* Interest in products that focus on emotional experience, not just features.
* Familiarity with Agile or iterative development workflows.



  





**How We Work at Kai** 



* We value clarity over speed.
* We avoid performative work and unnecessary complexity.
* We believe kindness and boundaries are design decisions.
* We build tools that help people connect, and not replace connection.
* Learning is encouraged. Asking questions is expected.



  





**Who This Role Is For** 




 This role is for you if:
