**Job Description**
 Mid\\-level Generative AI Application Developer:
   

  

 We are looking for an experienced Generative AI Application Developer to join our team and lead the design and implementation of AI\\-powered internal applications such as chatbots, copilots, and workflow automations. You will be responsible for building, integrating, and evolving generative AI applications that connect to Experian's internal systems and APIs, using modern Python frameworks and large language models. You will work with engineers, product, and partners to deliver, secure and scalable AI solutions that create value across the organisation.
   

  

 What you'll need to bring to the role \\& Experian
   

  

* A Bachelor's degree in computer science, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).
* 3–5 years of experience in software development, with at least 1–2 years hands\\-on building generative AI or ML\\-create applications.
* Programming skills in Python, including writing clean, modular, testable code; use virtual environments, dependency management, and packaging; debugging, logging, and error\\-handling in production services.

* I have over 1 year of experience with Python\\-based generative AI frameworks, such as LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, or similar orchestration frameworks. I can choose and structure frameworks appropriately, rather than using them as black boxes.
* Working knowledge of Model Context Protocol (MCP), tools/plugins, or equivalent connector patterns, and how agents securely call external systems.
* An understanding of how applications and APIs work end\\-to\\-end is important. This includes designing and consuming REST/HTTP APIs, which involves authentication, pagination, rate limiting, and error handling. Additionally, it involves building backend services or microservices, such as those using FastAPI, Flask, or similar technologies.
* Hands\\-on experience with databases and data access (ex: relational databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and ORMs/Query builders) and basic schema design and query optimisation for application workloads.
* Practical exposure to cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure), especially for hosting APIs and services, using managed databases, queues, and storage. Basic security, networking, and secrets management concepts.
* Experience working in Agile teams (Scrum/Kanban), using Git and CI/CD pipelines; comfortable participating in code reviews and improving engineering practices.

* Use frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI Agents / Assistants SDK to orchestrate prompts, tools, and agents.
* Shape and evolve RAG architectures, including document ingestion, embeddings/vector stores and retrieval flows, to improve relevance and quality.
* Implement guardrails, safety controls and fallbacks to ensure secure, reliable and compliant AI behaviour in production.
* Contribute to standards, documentation and mentoring, helping junior developers and the wider team adopt good practices in generative AI development.
* Participate in testing and evaluating AI applications to ensure they are, in consideration of our requirements, and safe to use (including checking prompts, guardrails, and failure modes).
* Collaborate with product and partners to understand use cases, define solutions, estimate effort and iterate based on feedback and metrics.


 More about you
   

  

* With a willingness to prototype by doing.
* Curiosity about how things work end\\-to\\-end: from the UI, through backend APIs, to the underlying models and data.
* Experience communicating updates and resolutions to customers and other partners and the ability to work collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team environment.
* Comfortable explaining technical concepts in simple terms to non\\-technical stakeholders.
* Team\\-oriented mindset, working closely with business users, analysts, developers, and other stakeholders.
* Experience reviewing code to find and address potential issues and defects, especially when testing and validating AI behaviour.
* Experience weighing specific technical tradeoffs to maximize impact for effort when designing prompts, tools, and user flows.
* Ethically aware of bias, hallucinations, privacy, and misinformation risks when designing and deploying AI solutions.


 Why this role is important to us

 JD Jones is a 100\\-year\\-old manufacturing company. We’re building internal products, dashboards, and digital tools from scratch and we need someone who can design and build clean, functional front end components using AI.
 



 This role requires equal parts design ability and front end development skill. You should be able to look at a rough requirement, design a proper interface for it, and build it — fast — using AI tools.
 



**WHAT YOU’LL DO** 



* Design and build UI components, pages, and interactive elements for internal products
* Take rough ideas or verbal descriptions and turn them into polished, functional interfaces
* Create reusable component libraries and design patterns that keep our products consistent
* Work with the AI \\& coding team to integrate front end with backend systems and APIs
* Use AI tools to prototype and iterate on designs quickly
* Improve how we present data, workflows, and dashboards to factory teams and management



**REQUIREMENTS** 




**Design Skills (Non\\-Negotiable):** 



* Strong visual design sense — colour, typography, spacing, hierarchy, layout
* Experience with Figma, Adobe XD, or similar design tools
* Ability to design responsive, mobile\\-first interfaces
* Understanding of UX principles — how people actually use interfaces, not just how they look



**Technical Skills:** 



* HTML, CSS, JavaScript — clean, semantic, well\\-structured code
* React or Next.js — component\\-based development, state management
* Tailwind CSS or equivalent utility\\-first framework
* Basic understanding of APIs and how front end connects to backend systems



**AI Tools:** 




**You must be actively using AI to design and code. This is a requirement, not a preference. You should be familiar with at least one of the following:** 



* Claude / Claude Code / Claude Artifacts
* Cursor
* v0 by Vercel
* Bolt / Lovable / Replit Agent
* GitHub Copilot



**Portfolio (Required):** 




**You need to show us things you’ve actually designed and built. Live sites, component demos, Figma files, GitHub repos — anything that demonstrates your design ability and front end skills. We want to see your work, not your certificates.** 




**WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR** 



* Attention to detail at the pixel level
* Someone who suggests better designs, not just builds what they’re told
* Genuine interest in AI\\-powered design and development workflows
* Clear communication — you can explain your design decisions
* Ability to move fast without compromising on quality



**WHAT WE DON’T CARE ABOUT** 



* Your degree, college name, or CGPA
* Whether you’re a student, dropout, or self\\-taught
* How many certifications or online courses you’ve completed



 Show us what you’ve built. That’s what matters.
 



**WHAT YOU’LL GET** 



* Real products to design and build — not mockups that sit in a folder
* Full creative freedom over the visual identity of our digital tools
* Direct collaboration with operations, manufacturing, and management teams
* Exposure to industrial automation and manufacturing
* Access to AI tools and resources
* A path to a full\\-time role if you deliver","Industrial Machinery Manufacturing","https://in.linkedin.com/company/jdjones","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C510BAQGg6tW34nRgYA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630566198924?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=O1Uw8wYM-rss81Cutv3JQKrbjf6Ja00e1x-G7Rp2idE","","","","","","","","","","",""
