**Responsibilities**
**Details on the opening**
 Database Test and Tools Development team is looking for bright and talented engineers from top tier institutes to apply their ingenuity to test Oracle’s flagship product. It is an opportunity to demonstrate your skills as a Test Development Engineer for Oracle’s cloud enabled platforms by developing cloud enabled tests for various features in Database, Cloud services and Engineered systems.
   

  

 We need to develop tools/ framework and test applications/scripts and automate the test setup needed for the features of Oracle Kernel code we are testing and often would need to simulate functionality in a regular Linux machine to run functional tests.
   

  

 This is a programming position as all the tests/frameworks are applications which should exercise a feature in the yet to be released version of Oracle product. These test programs runs fully automated on a server farm \\- so our test framework need to configure, run test applications/inject failures, and verify results by itself. Most of the features would need very specific test programs/frameworks.
   

  

 The opening is for an individual contributor position in Database test and tools development team. In this position, you will be working very closely with the feature development team to create a test plan/tools/infrastructure needed for the feature.
   

  

 You will also be reviewing the feature specifications (Functional \\& Design spec) before it is finalized as your inputs from a customer perspective might be important in the implementation.
   

  

 Our primary development platform is Linux, and depending on the area you work on the coding would involve Perl, Python, C or Java to develop test programs. The challenge and the advantage is in understanding the technology and apply it in a practical setup.
   

  

**What You Gain**
* Exposure to cutting edge technologies/products in database/cloud space
* Work with core team of people from top colleges to build best in class Database products
* Deep dive into Database/Cluster/Cloud services domains
* Exposure to Open source technologies Docker, Jira, Kafka, ML


**The group**
 'Database test \\& tools development' group (part of the database server group of Server Technologies Division) works on the upcoming releases of Oracle database server, Database cloud services \\& Engineered systems enveloping a wide range of technologies. The group with its state of the art development infrastructure and practices helps shape technology that has been important for a large number of Fortune 2000 and other companies. The group foresees product usage scenarios, simulates real life problems, tests the forthcoming releases of Oracle products and services to ensure that customers receive them with the highest quality.
   

  

**Position Overview**
 The .NET team is responsible for Oracle Database integration with the Microsoft .NET platform.
