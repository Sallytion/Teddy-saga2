 We are hiring full\\-time Full Stack (AI) Engineering interns. You will have several questions. Let us try to answer some.
   

  

**What does the Intern work on?**
 The intern will be a junior engineer in the team working on several aspects of data engineering \\- data collection, data transformation and data analysis; you will also work on some front\\-end aspects \\- making you a full\\-stack engineer. You will work with senior engineers in the team who are very helpful \\- so you will learn a lot. This means you will need to be strong in your fundamental programming skills and data structures.
   

  

 You should have an awareness of what Machine Learning is and how one can leverage AI to solve problems; we do not build foundational models but use them. Above anything else, you must be able to write solid code \\- and we make no compromise in that.
   

  

**What is the platform and language on which we write code?**
 We write code on Linux based systems and write some code in Java and most code in Python. We expect the intern to have coded on Linux for some time and have basic knowledge in Unix command line as you will have to write Unix shell scripts quite often. Since we play with large datasets, we expect you to know SQL really well (simple SELECT statements will not make the cut) and more so the fundamentals of databases.
   

  

**How long is the internship?**
 For a period of 6 months. This is a full\\-time internship, that means it is not 2 days a week or half day every day. At present it is remote but you have to be in the India time zone.
