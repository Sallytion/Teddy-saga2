**About the role:**




 As a Principal Software Engineer at Cimpress Technology, you will play a pivotal role in creating innovative software solutions that drive success for both our customers and Cimpress\\-owned businesses. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to design and architect systems that are scalable, reliable, and secure, leveraging both the MCP Platform and cutting\\-edge industry technologies.
 



 In this role, you will have the unique opportunity to collaborate directly with customers, gaining insights into their challenges and goals. Your expertise will enable you to craft tailored solutions while promoting best practices across teams. You’ll also be instrumental in gathering and validating critical product feedback, ensuring that our platforms evolve in ways that deliver maximum value.
