 We are looking for
 **Senior Java Developer** 
 for one of our exciting project.
 



  





**Work Expectations** 




  





 We are looking for a strong Java Backend Engineer with AWS experience who can operate confidently in a fast\\-paced, security\\-first delivery environment. The ideal candidate will bring at least 5\\+ years of hands\\-on experience building, maintaining, and enhancing Java\\-based backend systems deployed on cloud platforms, primarily AWS.
 



  





 A key focus of this role will be identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities highlighted by automated security scans and tools such as Wiz. This includes analyzing findings, prioritizing remediation, upgrading dependencies, and ensuring fixes are implemented without impacting application stability or performance. The engineer will work within a structured yet rapid deployment cycle, with production releases occurring every two weeks, requiring discipline, speed, and attention to detail.
 



  





 This role demands end\\-to\\-end ownership—from making code changes and validating fixes to deploying updates into production and monitoring post\\-release behavior. Proactivity is critical; the engineer should be comfortable taking responsibility, anticipating issues, and collaborating with security, DevOps, and platform teams to ensure smooth releases.
 



  





**Technical Skills \\& Expertise** 




  





 The candidate must have a strong command of the Java ecosystem, including Spring Boot and commonly used supporting libraries and frameworks. Hands\\-on experience upgrading libraries, frameworks, and dependencies—while maintaining backward compatibility and minimizing regression risks—is essential.
 



  





 A solid understanding of AWS services, deployment processes, and environment configurations is required, along with familiarity in navigating cloud\\-native architectures. Exposure to security scanning tools such as Wiz and the ability to quickly learn and adapt to new security and compliance requirements will be a strong advantage.
 



  





 Overall, we are looking for a dependable Java backend professional with AWS expertise, strong problem\\-solving skills, and high learnability to thrive in a continuously evolving engineering landscape.","IT Services and IT Consulting, Information Services, and Technology, Information and Media","https://se.linkedin.com/company/tarento-group","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQGrBQNtZz4pxA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630670724920/tarento_group_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7tOeTEpBymMHQOaquH1lqZVbcL1n-FPZksKLLTKDSeo","","","","","","","","","","",""

 We are looking for a hands\\-on Tech Lead / Senior Backend Engineer to take end\\-to\\-end ownership of our Lighthouse platform used by enterprise industrial clients (including large manufacturing deployments). This is a high\\-ownership role in a lean team where the engineer is expected to operate across backend services, real\\-time systems, cloud infrastructure, and production operations.
 



 The platform integrates with on\\-ground hardware (RFID readers and related devices), processes high\\-frequency events, and powers dashboards, attendance/location workflows, and alerting. The engineer should be comfortable working with multiple languages and diagnosing real production issues under real client constraints.
 



  




 Why This Role Exists
 
 The current system has grown with significant responsibilities concentrated in a single owner. We need a senior engineer who can
