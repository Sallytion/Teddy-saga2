 THE MISSION — READ THIS OR SCROLL PAST
 
 We’re building a
 **B2B HR Tech product from ZERO to REVENUE in 30 days** 
 .
 



 If you think frontend is just “making things look pretty,” stop reading now.
 



 This is
 **not a frontend internship** 
 .
 



  





 This is a
 **production battlefield** 
 where UI, backend, APIs, chatbots, and real users collide.
 



 We’re looking for
 **1–2 absolutely insane frontend engineers** 
 who can turn raw logic, APIs, and chaos into a working product that businesses actually use.
 



  





 👉 This includes
 **shipping installable desktop applications** 
 that enterprise users can download and run on their machines.
 



  




 WE’RE NOT OFFERING
 * Money (we’re bootstrapped and honest about it)
* Perfect Figma files or pixel\\-perfect hand\\-holding
* Time to “learn slowly”
* Fake internships with no real responsibility



  




 WE
 *ARE* 
 OFFERING
 * Real\\-world frontend experience most engineers don’t get till 2–3 years into a job
* Direct work on a
 **live B2B SaaS product**
* Deep experience integrating frontend with backend systems
* Exposure to

* Experience shipping

 Frontend MVP that actually works, not just looks good
 


* Convert rough ideas into real UI
* Integrate frontend with backend APIs (Supabase / Node / FastAPI)
* Build core flows: dashboards, forms, chatbot UI, notifications
* 👉 Package the web app into a

 when required



  




 PHASE 2: FIRE MODE
 
**Goal:** 
 Keep the UI usable when real users start breaking things

 PHASE 3: SCALE MODE
 
**Goal:** 
 Make frontend enterprise\\-ready

 WHAT YOU’LL ACTUALLY DO
 * Build frontend using
 **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React**
* Integrate frontend with backend APIs (this is critical)
* Work on
 **chatbot UI** 
 , notifications, dashboards
* Turn ideas into working applications fast
* 👉 Package the React app into
 **installable desktop apps** 
 (Mac / Windows)
* Debug frontend–backend integration issues
* Push code to production and hope nothing breaks (then fix it)



  




 NON\\-NEGOTIABLE TECH STACKYou MUST be good at:
 * **HTML / CSS** 
 (real layouts, not tutorial stuff)
* **JavaScript** 
 (logic, async, API handling)
* **React** 
 (components, state, hooks)
* **Frontend–Backend integration** 
 (this matters more than design)



  




 You’ll work with:

* Authentication flows
* Chatbots, notifications, and dynamic UI states
* 👉 Desktop app frameworks like
 **Electron or Tauri** 
 (we’ll guide you if needed)

 **making things work** 
 , not just look good

 We’ll give you a small real frontend task involving
 **API integration and/or desktop packaging** 
 .
 



  




 Step 3: Reality Check
 
 We’ll explain how intense this is.
 



 If you’re still excited — welcome aboard.
 



  




 THE HARD TRUTH
 
 This will not be easy.
 



 You will:
 


* Debug UI issues caused by backend changes
* Fix things at odd hours
* Learn more in 6 months than most internships teach in 2 years



 But you’ll also:
 


* Build a
 **real SaaS product**
* Ship
 **installable desktop applications**
* Gain confidence that you can ship production frontend
* Stand out massively in placements and interviews



  




 HOW TO APPLY
 
 If you’re still reading and thinking

 :
 



  





 Send:
