 We’re in the midst of the transformation from legacy monoliths to an event\\-driven cloud architecture. You wouldn’t have dealt with as many orders as go through our system (and if you have – talk to me!), so scalability becomes second nature, for both performance and cost.There are heaps of challenges in front of us, but we’re prepared and look forward to becoming truly agile with modern architecture – and maybe with your help. We’re not chasing shareholder value; we want to help the many people to have a better everyday life. Order Management – you might know it, or you might have no clue! Either is fine, as we’ll help you to get an understanding and find your ways around creating, executing, releasing, and deviating orders. This won’t get boring thanks to the many different flows and integrations in our omni\\-channel setup! We aim to have driven, empowered agile teams who understand priorities and how to come to agreements with other teams and domains. We’re all in this together and we try to help others and share our knowledge often. We want to become the best in class – yes, that’s a lofty goal, but why aim for less? If you feel the same then you’ll fit right in, come and help us push boundaries! We have values and we live them – they’re all important and I’m happy to share them with you in more detail, but these stand out for me:
   

 Togetherness, Simplicity, leading by example, and different with a meaning – get in touch and I can explain in detail!
