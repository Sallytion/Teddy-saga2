 –    Pinterest, Snap, Reddit, TikTok Ads — ongoing integration expansion as Adrsta's publisher network grows.
 



 –    Design a unified integration layer so new publisher APIs can be added quickly with standardized authentication (OAuth2, system tokens), rate\\-limiting, retry logic, and error handling.
 



  
 



**3 · Agentic AI Workflows** 




 Design and build autonomous AI agents that run as scheduled or event\\-driven workflows, producing recommendations and taking actions on behalf of advertisers:
 



  
 



 –    Bid Agent — analyzes real\\-time campaign performance data and adjusts bids programmatically across Meta, Google, and other platforms to maximize incremental ROAS within advertiser\\-defined constraints.
 



 –    MMM Agent — orchestrates Marketing Mix Modeling pipelines end\\-to\\-end: data ingestion, model training, scenario simulation, and budget recommendation delivery to media buyers.
 



 –    Geo Lift Agent — designs, launches, and reads out synthetic control geo lift experiments; surfaces causal incrementality estimates and confidence intervals without requiring holdout group revenue sacrifice.
 



 –    Predictive CAPI Agent — enriches server\\-side conversion events with ML\\-derived signals (Predicted LTV, purchase propensity scores, churn risk) before transmission to Meta and Google to improve value\\-based bidding and audience quality.
 



  





**What we are looking for:** 




 –    5–10 years of professional software engineering experience, ideally in ad tech, marketing technology, or data\\-driven SaaS.

 –    Cloud \\& Infra: AWS or GCP — Lambda/Cloud Run, S3/GCS, IAM, basic Terraform or CDK. Docker and CI/CD pipelines.
 



 –    AI/ML integration: Experience calling LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic), building prompt pipelines, and working alongside data scientists to productionize statistical or ML models.
 



 –    Ad Platform APIs: Awareness and knowledge of at least two of — Meta Graph API / CAPI, Google Ads API, GA4, Shopify Admin API, or similar publisher APIs.
 




 –    
 
 Security: OAuth2 flows, token management, API key rotation, and basic AppSec best practices.
 



  





**What we offer:** 




 –    Competitive salary and meaningful early\\-stage equity — you are joining a team building something from the ground up.
 



 –    Fully remote with a strong preference for EST\\-aligned availability.
 



 –    Direct access to leadership: you will work with the leadership and partners.
 



 –    Work with some of the largest advertisers and publishers in the world — real scale, real stakes.

 Type: Full\\-time Reports to:
 



 Project Manager / Operating Partner
 



  





 The Company We are building a vertically integrated, AI\\-native operating platform for institutional real estate investment. The platform automates and connects every stage of the investment lifecycle — from acquisition through renovation, leasing, and refinance — replacing manual processes with code, AI, and SaaS integrations. Remote\\-first, no on\\-ground employees.
 



  





 How We Build Software We follow an automation\\-first hierarchy: code first, then specialized AI, then LLMs, then offshore humans, then US contractors. Humans are the last resort, not the first option. All feature work follows a spec\\-driven development approach. You write specs, orchestrate Claude Code agents, review output, and iterate. You are an engineer who directs AI, not a typist who writes every line by hand. If you think what took an hour still takes an hour or AI coding tools are a gimmick, this is not the role.
 



  





 Role Summary Build and scale the platform across core operational modules: deal intake, underwriting, renovation tracking, property management, and refinance workflows. You own end\\-to\\-end features across frontend, backend, data, and integrations. The work involves financial models and real estate analytics, not just web forms.
 



  





 Responsibilities
 



  





 1\\. Full\\-Stack Feature Delivery
 



  





 Build production features across the wholesaler portal and internal back\\-office platform. Translate product specs into shipped software with minimal supervision.
 



  





 • Deal submission, tracking, and offer management workflows
 



 • Underwriting dashboards with financial calculation displays
 



 • Renovation data aggregation and progress views
 



 • Property performance and portfolio analytics
 



  





 2\\. Integrations \\& Data Orchestration
 



  





 The architecture aggregates data from multiple SaaS modules into one unified platform intelligence layer. You build and maintain these integration pipelines.
 



  





 • Integrate third\\-party SaaS systems via APIs (CRM, construction management, property management, inspection, valuation, and finance tools)
 



 • Build data pipelines into the central repository (Aurora \\+ S3\\)
 



 • Normalize external data into platform schemas with clean domain boundaries
 



  





 3\\. Backend Services \\& AI Layer
 



  





 Underwriting and intelligence engines run as backend services integrated with AI models. Primary backend is Node.js/Next.js server components, with Python/FastAPI for calculation\\-heavy and AI services.
 



  





 • Build Node.js APIs and Next.js server components for core platform logic
 



 • Implement calculation engines for underwriting and financial analysis
 



 • Integrate AI/RAG services (AWS Bedrock, SageMaker) where Python services are required • Design event\\-driven workflows across platform modules
 



  





 4\\. Frontend Platform UX:
 



  





 The platform runs on Next.js with server components. You build responsive dashboards, portals, and internal tools.
 



 • Build responsive dashboards and portals (Next.js / React / TypeScript)
 



 \\-Implement authentication flows (AWS Cognito), forms, and analytics views
 



 • Connect frontend to backend microservices and SaaS APIs
 



 • Maintain clean, reusable component architecture
 



  





 5\\. System Architecture \\& Scalability
 



  





 • Design modular services aligned to platform domains (acquisitions, renovation, PM, refinance)
 



 • Maintain clean boundaries between modules so SaaS tools are replaceable
 



 • Optimize performance and cost on AWS (Amplify, Aurora, S3, Cognito, SES)
 



 • Ensure reliability across multiple third\\-party integrations
 



  





 6\\. AI\\-Native Development Workflow This is not a bolt\\-on. It is how we work daily.
 



  





 • Use Claude Code as primary development tool for task execution
 



 • Follow spec\\-driven development: write specs first, then orchestrate AI agents to implement
 



 • Work within agentic coding teams under Claude orchestration
 



 • Continuously improve prompts, specs, and agent workflows for higher output quality
 



  





  





 Tech Stack
 







 Layer Technologies
 



  





 Frontend:
 

 Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
 



  





 Backend (Primary): Node.js, Next.js Server Components
 



  





 Backend (AI/Calc): Python, FastAPI (for AI and calculation services)
 



  





 Data \\& Cloud: AWS Amplify, Aurora (PostgreSQL), S3, Cognito, SES
 



  





 AI / Analytics: AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, RAG pipelines
 



  





 Integrations: CRM, construction management, property management, inspection, valuation, and finance SaaS tools via REST APIs and more.
 



  





 Dev Tooling: Claude Code, Jira/Azure devops, spec\\-driven workflows, agentic teams
 



  





 Requirements
 



  





 Must\\-Have:
 



 4\\+ years full\\-stack production experience
 



 • Strong Next.js and React production experience (this is the primary framework)
 



 • Node.js backend API development
 



 • AWS production deployment experience
 



 • SQL and data modeling (PostgreSQL preferred)
 



 • Experience integrating third\\-party SaaS APIs
 



 • Proficiency with AI\\-assisted development (Claude Code, Cursor, or similar), or demonstrated ability to adopt new tooling fast
 




 • Experience with spec\\-driven or AI\\-orchestrated development workflows
 




  





  





 Strong Plus :
 



 • Python/FastAPI for calculation or AI service layers • Workflow/automation system design
 



 • Data pipelines and ETL experience
 



 • AI/LLM integration in production • Dashboard, ERP, or fintech\\-style application development
 



  





  





 What Success Looks Like:
 



  





 60 Days: Shipping MVP features end\\-to\\-end using the Claude Code workflow.
 



  





 6 Months: Owning a full platform domain end\\-to\\-end. Writing high\\-quality specs that agents can execute reliably. Operating within multi\\-agent development workflows and improving them.
 



  





 Candidate Profile:
 



  





 Builder mindset. Ships fast within structured systems. Comfortable across the full stack. API\\-first thinker. Systems thinker who sees patterns and designs for repeatability. Adopts AI\\-native development as a force multiplier, not a threat.","Wellness and Fitness Services","https://kw.linkedin.com/company/masaj-co","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQED1zQkkWdGIg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1655373729137?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7wAKeOsHd-vxgZbT19vXDabzUqdTKgtXysQfxLQ07b8","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2015, we’ve lent over $18 billion across the UK and US, helped create more than 58,000 new homes and 36,000 new jobs, and supported hundreds of thousands of personal savers — all while fuelling the UK economy.
   

  

 OakNorth is a profitable business that has supported the growth of thousands of entrepreneurs with a new standard of business lending. We're looking for people to join our Engineering team in building upon this success, as we grow to play a key part in redefining the future of business banking with next generation financial tools and products.
   

  

 This is a fantastic opportunity to join a fast\\-paced, growing bank with a reputation for doing things differently. We don’t want another cog in the machine, we’re looking for self\\-starters and bold thinkers who want to pave their own career paths.
   

  

**The role 👋**
* Have a strong technical background, including 5\\-6 \\+ years of experience designing and engineering large scale systems
* Strong experience in either backend (Python) or frontend (React) in enterprise\\-class applications, with a pragmatic attitude to tech and a willingness to grow into full stack over time
* Architecture and system design knowledge (prefer in Domain\\-driven Design, Event design)

* Care deeply about mentorship and growing your colleagues

* 🎨 TypeScript, React, styled\\-components
* 🔧 Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, pytest
* ☁️ AWS, GCP
* 🚀 ECS Fargate, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions


**How We Expect You To Work 👷‍♀️**
* We expect you to work in these ways, as well as encouraging and enabling these practices from others:
* Collaborate 💬 \\- We work in cross\\-functional, mission driven, autonomous squads that gel over time. We pair program to work better through shared experience and knowledge.
* Focus on outcomes over outputs ✅ \\- Solving a problem for users that translates to business results is our goal. Measurements focused on that goal help us to understand if we are succeeding.
* Practice continuous improvement 💡 \\- We optimise for feedback now, rather than presume what might be needed in the future and introduce complexity before it will be used. This means we learn faster. We share learnings in blame\\-free formats, so that we do not repeat things that have failed, but still have confidence to innovate.
* Seek to understand our users 👂 \\- We constantly seek understanding from data and conversations to better serve our users' needs, taking an active part in research to hear from them directly and regularly.
* Embrace and enable continuous deployment 🤖 \\- Seamless delivery of changes into an environment \\- without manual intervention \\- is essential for us to ensure that we are highly productive; consider resiliency; and practice security by design.
* Test outside\\-in, test first 🚦 \\- TDD keeps us confident in moving fast, and deploying regularly. We want to solve user problems, and so we test with that mindset \\- writing scenarios first, then considering our solution; coupling tests to behaviour, rather than implementation.
* You build it, you run it ⚙️ \\- We embrace DevOps culture and end\\-to\\-end ownership of products and features. Every engineer, regardless of their role, has the opportunity to lead delivery of features from start to finish.
* Be cloud native ☁️ \\- We leverage automation and hosted services to deliver resilient, secure services quickly and consistently. Where SaaS tools help us achieve more productivity and better\\-quality results for a cheap price, we use these to automate low value tasks.

We want to be able to bring our whole selves to work, have our own perspectives and know that we belong.

**About Us**
 We’re OakNorth Bank and we embolden entrepreneurs to realise their ambitions, understand their markets, and apply data intelligence to everyday decisions to scale successfully at pace.
   

  

 Banking should be barrier\\-free. It’s a belief at our very core, inspired by our entrepreneurial spirit, driven by the unmet financial needs of millions, and delivered by our data\\-driven tools.
   

  

 And for those who love helping businesses thrive? Our savings accounts help diversify the high street and create new jobs, all while earning savers some of the highest interest on the market.
   

  

 But we go beyond finance, to empower our people, encourage professional growth and create an environment where everyone can thrive. We strive to create an inclusive and diverse workplace where people can be themselves and succeed.
   

  

***Our story***
 OakNorth Bank was built on the foundations of frustrations with old\\-school banking. In 2005, when our founders tried to get capital for their data analytics company, the computer said ‘no’. Unfortunately, all major banks in the UK were using the same computer – and it was broken.
   

  

 Why was it so difficult for a profitable business with impressive cashflow, retained clients, and clear commercial success to get a loan?
   

  

 The industry was backward\\-looking and too focused on historic financials, rather than future potential.
   

  

 So, what if there was a bank, founded by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs? One that offered a dramatically better borrowing experience for businesses?
   

  

 No more what ifs, OakNorth Bank exists.
