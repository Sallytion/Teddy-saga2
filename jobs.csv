 In\\-office expectations
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in\\-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in\\-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

 is building the Human Body API — a non\\-invasive technology that reads and interprets brain and
   

  

 body signals in real time. Founded in 2020, we create biosignal\\-powered infrastructure enabling applications
   

  

 across health, performance, research, and human–computer interaction. Backed by global partners and
   

  

 recognized by leading platforms, we’re making the human body machine\\-readable and accessible to the
   

  

 world.
   

  

**Role: Principal Architect Engineer — Systems, Compiler \\& OS\\-Level**
 Location: Bangalore
   

  

**About the Role:**
 As part of our mission to democratize neurotechnology, we are seeking a Principal Architect Engineer to
