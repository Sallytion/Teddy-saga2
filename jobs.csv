Organizations still depend on oversized teams and aging tools to manually produce content, facilitate moderation, and pull actionable insights from fragmented user interactions. Even with AI technology widely available, deploying a simple automation typically requires weeks of effort, often resulting in pilots that never reach production. The consequences include lost revenue opportunities, exhausted personnel, and technology infrastructures unable to match the pace of contemporary commerce.
   

  

 IgniteTech is dismantling this paradigm. We replace human\\-intensive processes with adaptive, AI\\-driven systems capable of operating at 10x the traditional scale and velocity. Picture a marketing apparatus that generates and publishes material in response to live trend data, or a community infrastructure that aggregates, moderates, and distributes insights within seconds—all built, launched, and refined by a compact team of AI\\-fluent engineers working in 24\\-hour cycles. We don't stop at prototypes; we deliver functioning tools that immediately reshape operational workflows.
   

  

 This position is not suited for someone interested in managing Jira backlogs within conventional DevOps cycles. You will not receive a requirements document to implement. You will instead assume full ownership of intelligent systems designed to automate and advance our client operations. Your work will involve diagnosing friction points, designing AI\\-centric architectures, delivering MVPs in less than a day, and hardening them into robust production engines with measurable outcomes. If you seek a sandbox for GenAI experimentation, look elsewhere. If you intend to deploy GenAI as a strategic advantage, this is the right opportunity.
   

  

 You will become part of a compact, high\\-caliber team reconstructing the operational framework of entire business domains using AI as the foundation. You will engage directly with leadership, operate at speed, and evaluate success by tangible business results. If this aligns with your professional aspirations, submit your application today.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Design and deliver working AI prototypes within 24 hours that instantly automate genuine business processes
* Take complete ownership of AI solutions from conception through deployment and monitoring, operating autonomously without dependency on external approvals or support
* Propel ongoing automation efforts throughout the organization by surfacing new use cases and refining existing solutions to align with shifting business demands and technological advances


**Technical Lead Key Responsibilities**
* Construct an entirely redesigned, AI\\-enabled infrastructure that converts manual marketing workflows and community systems into intelligent platforms generating 10x operational value


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your default approach involves writing code manually before applying AI tools for validation or improvement, rather than leveraging AI from the outset, this role is not appropriate)
* A minimum of 5 years in full\\-stack software engineering (proficiency in both front\\-end and back\\-end development is mandatory)
* Hands\\-on experience embedding AI/LLMs (through API integration, prompt engineering, or workflow automation) into production applications
* Competence with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and constructing scalable, distributed architectures
* Knowledge of how to select appropriate LLM models for varying use cases and objectives
* Proven familiarity with and practical use of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

These improvements are essential because they directly impact how quickly products reach the market and how satisfied customers ultimately become. Historically, software deployment cycles have been prolonged by conventional coding methods, with approximately 30% of projects running over schedule due to inefficiency and error.
   

  

 IgniteTech is at the forefront of this shift, leveraging advanced GenAI technologies to fundamentally reshape how software is architected and built. This position is distinct from roles focused on incremental optimization—it provides the opportunity to spearhead transformative, AI\\-powered initiatives. You will play a central role in applying AI to not merely improve, but to fundamentally reinvent development processes and results, delivering substantial gains in efficiency and strategic advantage.
   

  

 This is a role suited to individuals who are committed to operating at the leading edge of technology. It is not an operational or execution\\-focused position; rather, it is strategic in nature, encompassing extensive research and development, prototyping, and the deployment of AI to create next\\-generation software. The ideal candidate combines deep expertise in AI and software architecture with a visionary mindset that drives business innovation through technology.
   

  

 In this capacity, you will guide our team in defining the architectural foundations and strategies that embed AI within our software offerings. Your contributions will be critical to our mission, directly shaping the productivity and quality of what we deliver. We seek candidates who are passionate about expanding the limits of what technology can achieve and are motivated to create measurable impact within the software industry.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Architect comprehensive frameworks for AI\\-powered systems that automate sophisticated elements of software development, including architecture generation, dependency management, and advanced predictive coding capabilities.
* Engage deeply with emerging trends in AI and software engineering through research and development activities, conference participation, and active involvement in both academic and professional networks. When new AI technologies emerge, we must be among the earliest to understand and evaluate them.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Routine Code Maintenance: Performing regular updates or debugging of existing codebases to address minor bugs or incremental functionality improvements.
* Standard Software Development: Executing basic coding tasks or building straightforward features that do not involve AI integration or advanced architectural considerations.

**Description**
 Prime Video is disrupting traditional media with an ever\\-increasing selection of movies, TV shows, Emmy Award winning original content, add\\-on subscriptions including HBO, and live events like Thursday Night Football. Our architecture operates at Amazon\\-scale and raises the bar for playback reliability, video start time, and image quality. Prime Video runs on thousands of device types in over 200 territories worldwide.
   

  

 The mission of the Content Localization \\& Accessibility team in Prime Video is to ""Delight Prime Video customers world\\-wide with relevant language options and accessibility assists from Day 1"".
   

  

 With Prime Video's 3Y goal to acquire and retain the next 100MM customers from international territories, it is imperative that our selection is made available to international customers in their preferred language. Generating such assets using Localization Service Providers (LSPs) takes multiple weeks to turn around and becomes cost prohibitive when scaled to our entire Catalog across the breadth of languages we support (32 UI languages). We obsess over making Prime Video the most inclusive streaming platform, providing content with accessibility assists like closed captions, audio description, and an industry\\-first Dialogue boost assist. With increased focus from regulatory bodies from several territories and mandating minimum bar for accessibility in terms of closed captions \\& audio descriptions coverage, the team is propelled to innovate for the customers in need. The Content Localization \\& Accessibility team drives this innovation by leveraging state of the art GenAI solutions to generate these multi\\-lingual and accessibility assets at scale, as well as building supply\\-chain automation, workflow management tooling and optimized human\\-in\\-the\\-loop solutions.
   

  

**Basic Qualifications**
* 5\\+ years of non\\-internship professional software development experience
* 5\\+ years of programming with at least one software programming language experience
* 5\\+ years of leading design or architecture (design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and existing systems experience
* Experience as a mentor, tech lead or leading an engineering team


**Preferred Qualifications**
* 5\\+ years of full software development life cycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, testing, and operations experience
* Bachelor's degree in computer science or equivalent
