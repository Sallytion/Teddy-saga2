 In\\-office expectations
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in\\-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in\\-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.

 We understand that software is living and needs investment. The challenge is making the right tradeoffs, communicating those decisions effectively, and crisp execution.
   

  

 We need engineers who can build services that handle millions of requests per second. We need engineers who can figure out how we can survive regional data center outages and protect our customers. We need engineers who can build services that enable us to offer even more options to customers and contribute to the overall growth of Oracle Cloud.

**Company:** 
**Location:** 
 Remote (Global)
 



**Job Type:** 
 Internship (Volunteer / Learning\\-Phase)
 



**Sector:** 
 Game Development, Computer Software, Systems Engineering
 



  




**About the Project: Net3\\.js** 

 Web\\-based 3D applications and games are a
 **$225B\\+ global market** 
 , yet developers still lack a unified, high\\-performance networking framework for the Three.js and React Three Fiber (R3F) ecosystems. At, we are building
 **Net3\\.js** 
 —a next\\-generation networking engine that bridges this gap by integrating
 **WebRTC** 
 for ultra\\-low latency,
 **WebAssembly (WASM)** 
 for near\\-native performance, and declarative React patterns.
 



  





  




**About the Founders \\& Studio** 

 We are a specialized tech studio led by developers with deep expertise in high\\-frequency systems:
 


* **Architecture Lead:** 
 Expert in Three.js, Unity (Mirror), and Netcode synchronization.
* **Networking Lead:** 
 Specialist in WebRTC, Mediasoup, and low\\-latency infrastructure.
* **Track Record:** 
 While our primary portfolio is currently confidential under
 **NDA** 
 , we have successfully delivered complex 3D multiplayer architectures and real\\-time gaming solutions for private enterprise clients.


**The Opportunity: Move Beyond ""Basic Projects""** 

 Most internships involve building simple CRUD apps or portfolio sites. Here, you will contribute to a
 **real\\-world core infrastructure product** 
 . You will work on technical challenges that have rarely been solved in the browser:
 


* **3D Scene Replication:** 
 Building delta\\-compression algorithms for Three.js object properties.
* 
* **Low\\-Latency Transport:** 
 Implementing WebRTC DataChannels that are
 **1\\.5x to 2\\.5x faster** 
 than standard WebSockets.
* 
* **Performance Offloading:** 
 Writing Rust\\-compiled WASM modules to handle heavy serialization and physics.
* 
* **Advanced Netcode:** 
 Developing client\\-side prediction and ""Time Rewind"" lag compensation logic.


- 

- 

**Who We Are Looking For** 

 We are seeking
 **5\\-7 Founding Interns** 
 who are passionate about learning and want to show
 **Open Source (OSS) contributions** 
 on their profiles.
 


* **Interest Areas:** 
 Three.js, React Three Fiber, WebRTC, Rust, WASM, or Node.js.
* **Mindset:** 
 You are a self\\-starter who wants to master high\\-end 3D networking and systems design.
* **Status:** 
 Students (Juniors/Seniors) or early\\-career devs looking for an ""Elite"" portfolio piece.


**⚠️ Transparency \\& Compensation** 
* **Phase:** 
 This is an early\\-stage,
 **zero\\-budget bootstrapping initiative** 
 .
* **Immediate Pay:** 
 There is
 **no immediate salary or profit\\-sharing** 
 . Revenue generation and salaries are planned for the v2\\.0/v3\\.0 rollout after securing funding (SSIP 2\\.0 / i\\-Hub) or achieving market adoption.
* **The Reward:** 
 You gain direct mentorship from industry experts, academic research credit (where applicable), and a ""Founding Member"" status that carries significant weight for future equity and career growth.


**Why Join Us?** 
1. **Elite Portfolio:** 
 Showcase a contribution to a complex networking engine, not just another app.
2. **Expert Mentorship:** 
 Work directly with founders who have mastered Unity Mirror and Mediasoup.
3. **Industry Standard:** 
 Be part of the squad that defines how multiplayer is done on the web for years to come.
