Founded in 2014 by Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar with a simple vision — to simplify payments for Indian businesses — we’ve since grown into a fintech powerhouse driving India’s digital payment revolution.
 



  





 Razorpay powers millions of businesses with a smarter, scalable stack that goes beyond transactions to help them truly build and grow.
 



  





 From seamless checkouts to payroll automation, across India, Singapore, and Malaysia, we’ve been engineering a fintech ecosystem that’s redefining how money moves across Asia — and we’re just getting started.
 



  





 Today, that ecosystem supports everyone from early\\-stage startups to some of India’s largest enterprises, enabling them to accept, process, and disburse payments at scale while expanding into new ways of managing money more efficiently.
 



  





 Our scale speaks volumes: Razorpay processes $180\\+ billion in annualized transactions, powering leading businesses like Airbnb, Facebook, WhatsApp, Airtel, CRED, BookmyShow, Zomato, Swiggy, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme — and over 100 of India’s unicorns. With strong roots in India and growing operations in Southeast Asia, we are shaping the next chapter of financial technology across the region.
 



  





 We are backed by global investors including GIC, Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India \\& SEA), Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, MasterCard, and Salesforce Ventures, having raised over $740 million to date. Strategic acquisitions — including Ezetap (POS and offline payments), Curlec (Malaysia expansion), BillMe (digital invoicing), and POP (rewards\\-first UPI) — along with earlier moves in fraud prevention, payroll, and lending, have further strengthened our platform and widened our footprint across Asia.
 



  





 But what truly sets Razorpay apart is our culture. At Razorpay, ownership is our oxygen — you own what you build, with no micromanagement or red tape, just the runway to make your ideas fly.

 Meion builds AI agents that sit on top of existing business systems and workflows to automate high\\-friction, manual operations. We work primarily with SMBs and mid\\-market companies, helping them save time and cost without forcing them to rip and replace their current tools.

 * Strong experience as a backend or full\\-stack engineer (startup or early\\-stage experience is a big plus)
* Comfortable working with APIs, integrations, and distributed systems
* Experience building with or around AI/LLMs (prompting, orchestration, tooling, not just calling an API)

 Turing is one of the world’s fastest\\-growing AI companies accelerating the advancement and deployment of powerful AI systems.
 



  





**Turing helps customers in two ways:** 
 Working with the world’s leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, multilinguality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and leveraging that work to build real\\-world AI systems that solve mission\\-critical priorities for companies.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 This position is within a project with one of the foundational LLM companies. The goal is to assist these foundational LLM companies in enhancing their Large Language Models.
 



  





 One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high\\-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine\\-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.
 



  





 For example, in the case of Agent Completion (AC) data generation, your task will be to simulate high\\-quality multi\\-turn conversations between a user and a smart assistant that utilizes function\\-calling tools to accomplish user goals. You will craft these dialogues by playing both the assistant and the user, while simulating tool use where necessary to guide the assistant through complex decision\\-making and real\\-world reasoning scenarios.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day look like:** 



* Design multi\\-turn conversations that simulate real interactions between users and AI assistants using apps like calendar, email, maps, and drive.
* Emulate both the
 **user** 
 and the
 **assistant** 
 , including the assistant's tool calls (only when corrections are needed).
* Carefully select when and how the assistant uses available tools, ensuring logical flow and proper usage of function calls.
* Craft dialogues that demonstrate natural language, intelligent behavior, and contextual understanding across multiple turns.
* Generate examples that showcase the assistant’s ability to gracefully complete feasible tasks, recognize infeasible ones, and maintain engaging general chat when tools aren’t required.
* Ensure all conversations adhere to defined formatting and quality guidelines, using an internal playbook.
* Iterate on conversation examples based on feedback to continuously improve realism, clarity, and value for training purposes.
* Collaborate with peers and reviewers to maintain consistency and high standards in deliverables.



  





**Requirements:** 



* Strong general
 **technical reasoning skills** 
 and the ability to model real\\-world assistant behavior using tool\\-based APIs.
* Ability to break down complex tasks and simulate realistic dialogues that reflect user expectations and assistant limitations.
* Experience in
 **any programming language or tech stack** 
 is acceptable; a strong grasp of APIs, data formats (e.g., JSON), and logical thinking is more critical than specific toolsets.
* Excellent written communication skills in English, with a focus on clarity, tone, and instructional coherence.
* Creativity and attention to detail in crafting realistic scenarios and responses.
* Experience working with or around LLMs, virtual assistants, or function\\-calling frameworks is a plus.
* Ability to follow detailed guidelines and formatting standards with high consistency.
* 3\\+ years of overall professional experience in a technical or analytical field.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing:** 



* Work in a fully remote environment.
* Opportunity to work on cutting\\-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.



  





**Offer Details:** 



* **Commitments Required** 
 : At least 4 hours per day and minimum 20 hours per week with overlap of 4 hours with PST. (We have 3 options of time commitment: 20 hrs/week, 30 hrs/week or 40 hrs/week)

 Turing is one of the world’s fastest\\-growing AI companies accelerating the advancement and deployment of powerful AI systems.
 



  





**Turing helps customers in two ways:** 
 Working with the world’s leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, multilinguality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and leveraging that work to build real\\-world AI systems that solve mission\\-critical priorities for companies.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 This position is within a project with one of the foundational LLM companies. The goal is to assist these foundational LLM companies in enhancing their Large Language Models.
 



  





 One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high\\-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine\\-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.
 



  





 For example, in the case of Agent Completion (AC) data generation, your task will be to simulate high\\-quality multi\\-turn conversations between a user and a smart assistant that utilizes function\\-calling tools to accomplish user goals. You will craft these dialogues by playing both the assistant and the user, while simulating tool use where necessary to guide the assistant through complex decision\\-making and real\\-world reasoning scenarios.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day look like:** 



* Design multi\\-turn conversations that simulate real interactions between users and AI assistants using apps like calendar, email, maps, and drive.
* Emulate both the
 **user** 
 and the
 **assistant** 
 , including the assistant's tool calls (only when corrections are needed).
* Carefully select when and how the assistant uses available tools, ensuring logical flow and proper usage of function calls.
