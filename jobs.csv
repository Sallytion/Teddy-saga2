+ Engage with manufacturing partners to validate capabilities, pricing, and delivery timelines.

* Risk Identification \\& Mitigation
+ Detect potential manufacturing challenges early, reducing costly rework or delays.
+ Recommend alternative manufacturing processes, tolerances, or materials when required.

* Platform\\-driven Quoting Solutions

 Prefer saying “let’s try it out!” instead of “it’s been done, and it doesn’t work”.
   

  

 Plan ahead and stay on top of things, but don’t get flustered if it doesn’t go as planned (predicting the future is hard, we tried it).
   

  

 Are curious, love to learn, and love to share your knowledge.
   

  

 Must have demonstrated interest in crypto although no professional experience in the area is required.

The basic architecture is already set up, we need help building out and expanding our coverage of blockchains and various protocols. You will also have significant input on how the product will evolve. But please, leave your ego at the door (we have no doors, so you’ll have to be creative about it).
   

  

**Culture**

 Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.
   

  

 Rippling Payroll is redefining how companies pay their people across the world — turning payroll from a cost center into a strategic advantage. Built on Rippling Unity — our unified workforce platform — Payroll connects HR, IT, and Finance so every policy, approval, and pay calculation automatically stays in sync across systems and countries.
   

  

 With $750M\\+ ARR, \\>23,000 customers, and \\>$70B in annualized payroll volume, we’re building the most intelligent, automated, and compliant payroll infrastructure on the planet.
   

  

****The Opportunity****
 We’re looking for a
 ****Senior Staff Software Engineer (P9\\)****
 to help architect and scale Rippling’s
 ****next\\-generation Global Payroll Platform****
 — a system that powers payments, compliance, and computation for millions of employees across 50\\+ countries.
   

  

 This role sits at the intersection of
 ****AI\\-powered automation****
 ,
 ****compliance\\-as\\-code****
 , and
 ****massive scale****
 — with direct ownership over core systems that define how Rippling processes global payroll, taxes, and payments at sub\\-second latency and near\\-zero error tolerance.
   

  

**What You’ll Own**
* Architect Rippling’s next\\-gen Payroll computation engine — modular, extensible, and capable of encoding multi\\-jurisdictional compliance logic declaratively.
* Design data models and pipelines that handle versioned pay runs, audit trails, retroactive corrections, and time\\-based computations at global scale.
* Build scalable rules engines to automate ever\\-changing tax, benefits, and labor laws across jurisdictions, ensuring compliance through dynamic, AI\\-generated logic.
* Modernize global payment infrastructure for real\\-time or near\\-instant disbursements while balancing reconciliation, fraud detection, and regulatory constraints.
* Evolve reporting and permissions systems to deliver real\\-time insights and granular access controls for complex, multi\\-entity organizations.
* Partner with Product, Compliance, and Finance teams to convert ambiguous regulatory specs into clear, deterministic system behavior.
* Lead high\\-impact initiatives like sandboxed “simulation” payrolls, AI\\-powered paystub explainability, and what\\-if analysis for enterprises.
* Shape the long\\-term platform vision, influencing 150\\+ engineers across Finance and HR Infrastructure as a multiplier, mentor, and architectural authority.


**What Success Looks Like**
* System Reliability: Sub\\-second computation accuracy for global pay runs, with zero critical compliance defects.
* Extensibility: New countries, pay types, and tax rules added with minimal engineering overhead.
* Performance: Orders of magnitude improvement in latency and cost efficiency across distributed computation.
* Developer Velocity: Simplified APIs, testing frameworks, and onboarding for internal and partner developers.
* Business Impact: Reduction in country onboarding time, payroll failure rates, and manual compliance interventions.


**What We’re Looking For**
* 14\\+ years of experience building large\\-scale distributed systems in high\\-compliance or high\\-integrity domains (Finance, Payroll, Tax, Insurance, etc.).
* Deep expertise in data architecture, domain\\-driven design, and rule\\-based / event\\-driven systems.
* Experience scaling compliance\\-heavy, multi\\-country systems — ideally payroll, tax, or financial computation platforms.
* Proficiency in designing modular service boundaries, ensuring backward compatibility and auditability.
* Strong understanding of computation correctness, versioned state, precision handling, and retroactive adjustments.
* Proven ability to partner across functions — translating legal/compliance constraints into elegant, maintainable systems.
* A strong architectural voice who can both design systems and mentor teams to scale them sustainably.


****Bonus Points****
* Experience with AI\\-driven system automation or compliance\\-as\\-code frameworks.
* Hands\\-on work with global payroll systems, real\\-time payments, or statutory tax logic.
* Familiarity with event sourcing, CQRS, streaming pipelines, and immutable data stores.
* Contributions to open\\-source distributed computation frameworks or rule engines.


****Why Rippling****
* Backed by world\\-class investors (Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, Bedrock, GIC, Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs)

**What’s MyARC?**
 The future of fitness is creator centric and MyARC is building the operating system for it.
   

  

 The online fitness market is set to hit $60bn by 2027, and fitness content creators with their huge fan bases are best positioned to capture this. They just don’t have
   

  

 the tools for it.
   

  

 A creator with 100k\\+ followers can only train \\~30 clients using today’s solutions, because they need to manually personalise each workout for each client. That’s
   

  

 why online coaching costs anywhere between $500\\-$1,000/month for consumers. It’s not scalable for creators as assistant coaches need to be hired nor
   

  

 is it affordable for fans. That’s where MyARC comes in.
   

  

 We automatically personalise generic training plans to any individual user’s needs. This means one creator can now train unlimited fans, providing creators with a scalable business model that doesn’t require an army of coaches, and fans get affordable personalised fitness with price coming down from $1,000/month to $20/month.
   

  

 Already, we’ve taken creators from minimum wage to 6\\-figure earnings and we’re on track to create MyARC millionaires on the platform. There are 1000s of users
   

  

 around the world with serious health transformations ranging from users overcoming obesity and coming out of a diabetic state, to cancer survivors
   

  

 gaining muscle for the first time.
   

  

 MyARC democratises personalised fitness for consumers and economically empowers creators.
   

  

**What’s my part in this?**
 TLDR \\- we are growing rapidly and have an ambitious roadmap to build an industry leading product.
   

  

 We’re looking for a full stack engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset to join the mission on a long\\-term basis. You’ll play a key role in the development and
   

  

 maintenance of our mobile and web apps. The ideal candidate will have expertise in Expo React Native, React, and Next.js, along with experience in building
   

  

 consumer\\-facing media\\-rich applications. If you’ve got experience with Django, DRF, and Python, that’s a bonus.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
 🔑 Building Great Products at Lightning Speed: Show initiative and take pride in completely owning your work. You’ll be on the front line, writing code that will be
   

  

 directly deployed to production in days, not weeks, and directly contributing to thousands of users’ lives.
   

  

 🔑 Working Autonomously in an Unstructured Team: Working directly with the founders and the rest of the engineering team to build scalable product and
   

  

 execute on the ambitious roadmap. You’ll need to be comfortable working in small, unstructured teams with changing priorities.
   

  

 🔑 Uphold Quality Standards: Write clean, maintainable, testable code that can easily be refactored and extended as business requirements adapt.
   

  

**Minimum Requirements:**
 ✅ Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field
   

  

 ✅ 5\\+ years of experience
