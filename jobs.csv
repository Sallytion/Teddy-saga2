 Why This Internship?
   

  

 This isn’t your average “do tasks \\& get a certificate” internship. This is your chance to join a stealth\\-mode AI startup gearing up for
 **Y\\-Combinator** 
 . You’ll be part of a small, fast\\-paced team building something that has the potential to change industries. Think of this as a real\\-world startup bootcamp—where every line of code, every idea, and every push forward matters.
   

  

 If you’ve ever wanted to experience the intensity of Silicon Valley without being there, this is it.
   

  

 What You’ll Do :
   

  

 Work directly with founders and core team on real product features.
   

  

 Get hands\\-on exposure to AI, product development, and startup hustle.
   

  

 Take ownership of projects that will actually go live, not “dummy work.”
   

  

 Brainstorm, experiment, fail fast, and learn faster.
   

  

 Contribute ideas that shape the company’s future (yes, your voice matters here).
   

  

  

 Who Should Apply :
   

  

 Students who want to do more than just learn theory, you want to build.
   

  

 Curious minds obsessed with AI, product design, or coding.
   

  

 Hustlers who are not afraid of hard problems, late\\-night brainstorms, and “figure it out” energy.
   

  

 Dreamers who want to see what it takes to
 **prepare for Y\\-Combinator** 
 .
   

  

  

 What You’ll Gain :
   

  

 A life\\-changing experience of being part of an early\\-stage startup.
   

  

 Mentorship directly from founders.
   

  

 A chance to add real product experience to your portfolio.
   

  

 Exposure to startup culture, investor pitch prep, and growth mindset.
   

  

 An unfair advantage over your peers, because you didn’t just intern, you built.
   

  

  

 This internship is not for everyone. It’s for the ambitious ones who want to see how the next wave of AI startups are built—up close and personal. If that sounds like you, then this is your calling.
