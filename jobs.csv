 A day in the life
   

  

 As a software engineer on the Prime Video team, my day starts with diving into hands\\-on coding and technical problem\\-solving.

The challenges are unique, especially when it comes to managing the sheer scale of requests we handle daily. To tackle these, I leverage AWS technologies like EC2, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, and CloudFront.
   

  

 Collaboration is a significant aspect of my role. I collaborate with a cross\\-functional team to align our technical strategies and define our long\\-term roadmap. It’s exhilarating to influence decisions that will shape the future of Prime Video. Throughout the day, I alternate between deep focus on coding and brainstorming sessions with my teammates to tackle novel challenges.
   

  

 Beyond the technical work, I also play a key role in mentoring junior engineers. Sharing my knowledge and seeing others grow is incredibly fulfilling. I’m always encouraged to push the boundaries of what’s possible, and I have the freedom to explore new ideas that can elevate our service to the next level.
