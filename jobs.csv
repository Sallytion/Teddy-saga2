* Cluster\\-to\\-cluster
* Service\\-to\\-service communication
* Collaborating closely with control\\-plane engineers to expose:
* Declarative APIs
* GitOps\\-friendly configuration
* Making pragmatic performance vs cost tradeoffs in real cloud environments



  





 Required Skills \\& Experience:
