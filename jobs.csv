With high\\-quality expert training data, tomorrow’s AI can better design, evaluate, and operate complex software systems at scale. That training data begins with you.
   

  

 We’re looking for SWE Infrastructure Specialists fluent in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python who specialize in systems thinking, software and infrastructure architecture, performance optimization, and quality engineering. You’ll challenge advanced language models on realistic infrastructure and platform scenarios involving cloud design, Infrastructure\\-as\\-Code abstractions, deployment workflows, scalability constraints, and failure modes. This work focuses on evaluating how models reason about architectural tradeoffs, abstraction layers, environment isolation, state management, and reliability across distributed systems.
   

  

 On a typical day, you will converse with the model on infrastructure and platform engineering tasks using JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, verify architectural soundness and logical correctness, assess code quality and testing strategies, analyze performance bottlenecks and deployment risks, capture reproducible failure cases, and suggest improvements to prompt design and evaluation metrics to strengthen model reasoning.
   

  

 A bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD in computer science, software engineering, or a closely related technical field is ideal. Real\\-world experience in cloud platforms, infrastructure engineering, platform or DevOps roles, performance analysis, or QA practices strongly signals fit. Clear technical communication and the ability to clearly articulate system\\-level reasoning and tradeoffs are essential.
   

  

 Ready to turn your engineering expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world.
   

  

 We offer a pay range of $80\\-to\\-$150 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above. As a contractor you’ll supply a secure computer and high\\-speed internet; company\\-sponsored benefits such as health insurance and PTO do not apply.
