 The Feed erased effort. The Grid was left unfinished — fragments of a code base buried in the collapse. Whoever built it didn’t leave instructions, only proof that it could be rebuilt through action.
 



 The Open Grid Fellowship is a selective 12\\-week program for experienced full\\-stack and open source developers. It begins inside the PlayOps ARG: daily missions in Telegram, 30–60 minutes a day, XP receipts for every proof of action. By the second month, your contributions evolve into real system builds — open validators, prototypes, and templates that define how the Grid works.
 



 This is not a job. It’s authorship in a system that outlives résumés. XP is sweat equity. Your receipts today become your stake tomorrow.
 



  





**What You’ll Do** 



* Enter the daily rhythm: 30–60 min Telegram missions, proof submissions, XP multipliers.
* Transition into system building: sketches → prototypes → working validators.
* Collaborate globally with players, storytellers, and builders.
* Leave behind open source templates used worldwide.



  





**Who We’re Looking For** 




 This track is not entry\\-level. It’s for builders who already ship code and contribute in the open.
 


* Full\\-stack developers comfortable moving between front\\-end, back\\-end, and data.
* Open source contributors who understand authorship \\+ collaboration.
* Devs who can translate fragments into systems with minimal guidance.
* Problem\\-solvers who thrive in ambiguity and want to author infrastructure, not just features.



  





**Why Join** 



* Your builds are featured in a global documentary \\+ Roku episodic series.
* Your validators launch as open templates used worldwide.
* Every action is logged as a receipt of authorship.
* XP is sweat equity in the Grid — unlocking future token rewards.
* Build inside a living ARG where story and system are inseparable.



  





**Requirements** 



* Demonstrated experience in full\\-stack development (front\\-end \\+ back\\-end).
* Prior contributions to open source projects.
* Strong command of JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, and one major framework (React, Node, or equivalent).
* Must have Telegram \\+ LinkedIn accounts.
* Comfortable reading \\+ typing in English (all text\\-based).
* Commit 30–60 minutes daily for 12 weeks (remote \\+ global).



  





**Compensation** 




 This is a fellowship, not a salary role. You’ll leave with:
 


* Authorship in validators and open templates.
* A builder profile with XP, badges, and skill scores.
* Credit in the PlayOps documentary.
* XP receipts that unlock tokenized rewards later.

* Integrations fluency: Practical experience with client/server patterns and APIs (SOAP, REST, GraphQL, XML/JSON), auth, rate limits, retries, and data mapping which drive exceptional customer outcomes.
