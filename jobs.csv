**About Destro AI:** 




 Destro AI is building the global intelligence layer for robotics — the agentic decision\\-making brain that tells any robot 
 *what to do, when, and why* 
  across complex warehouse workflows. While most robotics companies focus on autonomy and sensors, Destro solves the real bottleneck: robots don’t understand workflows.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 





 We’re looking for a Founding Software Engineer who can take ownership of our fragmented codebases — and productionize, integrate, and harden it into a robust, scalable, enterprise\\-ready solution that can run in both cloud and on\\-prem environments. This is a mission\\-critical role where you’ll work directly with the founding team, own deployment architecture, and prepare the stack for live enterprise pilot launches.
 





  
 




**What You’ll Own:** 



* Refactor MVP codebases into a unified, modular platform
* Build backend APIs, scalable services, and data flows using Python
* Own DevOps, CI/CD, and infrastructure for on\\-prem and cloud\\-native deployments
* Containerize everything (Docker, Kubernetes)
* Build secure auth, RBAC, and observability for production readiness
* Implement real\\-time data processing, MQTT/gRPC APIs, Redis streams, etc.



  





**Tech Stack (you should be fluent with most):** 



* Backend: Python, Node.js
* Frontend: React, TypeScript
* DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes
* Cloud: AWS, GCP
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions or similar
* Infra: Linux, Postgres, MQTT, gRPC, Redis, APIs
* Bonus: Robotics/IoT deployments, RTLS integration, or wearable UX



  





**What We’re Looking For:** 



* Have 2 \\- 4 years of experience in full stack/backend/devops roles
* Have shipped real enterprise or infra products — bonus if in hybrid or on\\-prem setups
* Know how to write good code across microservices and edge devices
* Be excited to work on AI for the physical world, not just cloud dashboards
* Care deeply about reliability, observability, and uptime
* Be able to move fast, own outcomes, and work independently



  





**Why Join Destro:** 



* Real\\-world AI \\+ Robotics
* Global Tech Exposure: Work with ex\\-Dexterity, ex\\-HAI Robotics, and NYU alumni, alongside top US retailers and 3PLs
* Equity \\+ Ownership: As a founding engineer, you’ll earn meaningful equity and have massive technical say
