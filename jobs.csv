 You’ll join as one of the first engineers, work directly with the CTO, and do what senior engineers rarely get to do in big teams: turn clear product direction into shipped production features at high speed. You’ll work across Python/FastAPI, React, Postgres, Azure, Docker, and async systems to build an enterprise AI platform with live customers. This is a high\\-ownership, low\\-process environment for engineers who value execution, judgment, and real impact. Bangalore\\-based role with regular in\\-person collaboration.
 




  





**Role Overview** 



* Location: Bangalore
* Team: One of the first 2–3 engineers
* Reports to: CTO
* Customers: Enterprise



  





**About PANTA** 





 PANTA builds enterprise AI systems that integrate into real production workflows, particularly in creative and publishing domains. We already have customers live and are in an active build\\-and\\-ship phase.
 




  





**The Role** 





 Work directly with the CTO as part of the founding engineering team. You will design, build, and ship production features end to end with a high degree of ownership and autonomy. This role is for engineers who want impact, speed, and accountability—not narrow scope.
 




  





**Responsibilities** 



* Ship end\\-to\\-end features used by enterprise customers
* Work across the stack: Python/FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Azure, Docker, GitHub
* Build integrations with AI platforms (Gemini, Azure OpenAI)
* Make pragmatic engineering decisions that balance speed and quality
* Own the reliability and correctness of what you ship



  





**What Success Looks Like** 



* You ship independently and consistently
* You require minimal context to be effective
* You remove execution bottlenecks
* The product moves faster because you are here



  





**What We’re Looking For** 



* 4\\+ years building and shipping production full\\-stack software
* Strong backend fundamentals and practical frontend ability
* Sound engineering judgment, high ownership, and execution speed
* Comfortable in early\\-stage, low\\-process environments



  






 We don’t hire for syntax memorization or framework loyalty. We hire engineers who can reason about systems and deliver outcomes. We actively use AI\\-assisted development tools (e.g. Claude, Gemini) to increase leverage—but you are expected to understand, review, and fully own the code that runs in production.

* Reduce flaky tests, long execution times, and false failures that erode trust in automation.
* Identify high\\-risk system areas (integration boundaries, asynchronous workflows, data transformations) and define targeted test strategies.
* Investigate test failures and escaped defects, perform root cause analysis, and drive durable fixes.
* Define and promote testing standards, automation best practices, and quality strategies across teams.


**What You Bring**
* 7\\+ years of experience as an SDET, Software Engineer in Test, or Software Engineer with significant test automation ownership.
* Strong proficiency in TypeScript and/or JavaScript.
* Hands\\-on experience with modern test automation frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium\\-based frameworks, or similar).
* Experience testing APIs, distributed systems, and asynchronous workflows.

* Experience supporting enterprise or B2B products with complex configurations and long\\-lived customers.


**Why Join US**
* Work on mission\\-critical systems used by utilities and public\\-sector organizations.
* Solve complex, real\\-world integration problems where quality genuinely matters.
* Operate in an engineering culture that values ownership, pragmatism, and outcomes over process.

**How do we do this:**
 Using Python we integrate with 10\\+ Accounting, CRM, and payment platforms, we run asynchronous ELT tasks. Storing the data, normalizing the data so we can work with data from separate systems like they are the same, and build smart automations on top of this. These automations vary from NLP to extract dates from documents, using elastic search to match separate data sources together, or building time based schedules from multiple data sources. Since there are a lot of variables, edge cases, and complex domain knowledge, we heavily rely on automated testing.

 Django, Celery, Postgres, Docker, Terraform, AWS, Integrating 3rd party APIs, building APIs, Unit \\& Integration testing.
   

  

**We''''''''re Looking For Someone Who Has An End\\-to\\-end Mindset.**
* You can take ownership of a task, propose a solution and plan, involve the right parties, ask the right questions, and can deliver independently if necessary.
* Preferably you''''''''re someone that understands no one person knows everything, and is willing to learn, but also explain and teach others.
