 Just like a baby’s brain, CynLr Visual Intelligence stack makes Robots to instinctively see \\& pick any object under any ambience, without any training. (a demo video link).
 



 Today, a robot that can fit a screw into a nut without slipping a thread, doesn’t exist. Imagine what it would take for a robot to assemble a Smartphone or a car by putting together 1000s of parts with varied shapes and weights, all in random orientations. Thus, factories become complex, needing heavy customization of their environment.
 



 CynLr\\-enabled visual robots
 *intuitively learn to handle even unknown objects, on\\-the\\-fly,* 
 eliminating the need for rigid fixtures, pre\\-training, or environment customization. This enables an universal alternative to custom automation thus simplifying factory lines into
 *modular LEGO\\-like micro\\-factories* 
 that can be rapidly reconfigured as products change.
 



 At the core of CynLr lies a fundamentally new approach to machine vision. Unlike conventional vision systems that rely on image recognition and heuristics, CynLr’ s Vision and ML stacks are
 *deeply inspired by neuroscience,* 
 modelling how biological vision understands shape, geometry, and interaction rather than appearance alone. To support this, CynLr builds its hardware, sensors, compute pipelines, and learning stacks from scratch, tightly coupling perception, decision\\-making, and action.
 



 This integration allows CynLr to operate in conditions that defeat traditional automation: variable lighting, cluttered environments, unknown objects, and high precision manipulation, unlocking automation use cases that have remained unsolved for decades. By rethinking vision as an intelligent, adaptive sense rather than a static tool, CynLr is redefining how robots perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world.
 



  





**About the Role:** 




 Product Design begins as a hypothetical concept. Transforming that concept into a functional Product is a highly creative and experimental process that requires a strong understanding of system\\-level fundamentals and application\\-driven trade\\-offs.
 



 In FPGA\\-based embedded systems, the utility and limitations of a product are defined by how effectively the FPGA platform is configured, integrated, and used at the system and application level. Performance, latency, determinism, and I/O capability depend on IP selection, configuration, firmware integration, and system architecture.
 



 You will be responsible for the application\\-level design, integration, validation, and deployment of FPGA\\-based embedded systems. The Product Design team will be your internal customer.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities:** 



* Supporting CynLr’s Product Design team with all FPGA application and system\\-level activities.
* FPGA platform configuration and integration using vendor\\-provided IP cores and reference designs.
* System bring\\-up, validation, and debugging of FPGA\\-based hardware platforms.
* Verification \\& Validation (V\\&V)
* Defining test procedures for FPGA\\-based systems and firmware
* Executing tests and validating manufactured PCBs and assemblies
* Interfacing with vendors (FPGA vendors, IP providers, PCB manufacturers, component suppliers, simulation and service providers) to plan and coordinate successful project execution.
* Acting as the FPGA application and system knowledge base for design engineers and freshers joining the organization.



  





**Team Structure \\& Career Path:** 




 This role resides in the Electronics team and is part of the larger hardware team. The role has touchpoints with other teams most notably the Product Design team. We are a startup and there is a tremendous potential to build your own team or grow into a principal engineer role over time in the space or expand into other areas.
 



  





**Job Requirements** 




 Below are some key requirements. We expect working knowledge in most areas and deep hands\\-on expertise in either FPGA or SoC
 



**A. Electronics \\& System Fundamentals:** 



* Strong understanding of digital electronics and system\\-level architecture.
* Solid understanding of register\\-based systems and memory architectures (DDR, SRAM, Flash).
* Working knowledge of power distribution and sequencing for FPGA\\-based systems.
* Understanding of processor and accelerator architectures (ARM\\-based SoC FPGAs).



**B. FPGA Application \\& Platform Development:** 



* Hands\\-on experience with FPGA or SoC\\-FPGA.
* Strong familiarity with FPGA vendor toolchains (Vivado, Quartus, Libero).
* Experience configuring and integrating:
* Vendor\\-provided IP cores
* Memory controllers
* Communication and data\\-movement IP Blocks
* Ability to generate FPGA bitstreams using existing IP and reference designs.



**C. Embedded Firmware Design \\& Development:** 



* Strong experience in embedded firmware development using C/C\\+\\+.
* Experience developing firmware for ARM cores inside FPGA SoCs
* Experience with bare\\-metal or RTOS\\-based systems.
* Ability to develop and debug drivers for memory\\-mapped peripherals.
* Good understanding of boot flows, BSPs, and build systems.



**D. Interfaces \\& Communication:** 



* Strong working knowledge of communication protocols:
* UART, SPI, I2C, AXI
* Ethernet, USB
* Experience debugging data flow, latency, and performance issues at the system level.



**E. Verification and Validation:** 



* Adept in using JTAG\\-based debugging tools.
* Experience with system bring\\-up and validation of FPGA\\-based boards.
* Experience using:
* Logic analyzers
* Oscilloscopes
* Vendor\\-provided tools (Vivado, Quartus, Libero)
* Ability to create and execute test procedures and validation plans.
* Ability to debug data flow and performance bottlenecks at the system level.



**F. Behavioural Tendency:** 




 Critical Thinking, Available, Responsible, Versatile, Resourceful, Thorough, Attention to Details \\& “Humble”.
 



  





**What Will You Do:** 




 CynLr’ s vision system is central in the control loop of the vision guided manipulation platform. The stereo vision system is acquiring at 75 FPS and this means processing must also happen at this speed or higher and the processing method based on neural network is computationally intensive as it involves a high level of successive matrix multiplication. For this the processing is split between multiple processing units FPGA, GPU and CPU based on the type of processing that is required. Your focus will be majorly on the FPGA, working closely with the Product Design team to build and deploy FPGA\\-based embedded systems at the application and system level. This includes configuring FPGA platforms using vendor tools and IP, developing embedded firmware to control and interface with FPGA logic, bringing up and validating hardware, and debugging system\\-level issues involving interfaces, memory, and peripherals. You will define and execute verification and validation procedures, support prototypes and manufacturing builds, and ensure reliable system behaviour in real\\-world use. This role focuses on integration, firmware, and system validation
 



  





**How Will You Do:** 




 Though confined to a focused area, the work is pretty much expected to be entrepreneurial with the exact advantages and difficulties of a startup. Since this is a startup and the product will evolve at a rapid pace, the contours of the technology, toolchain \\& Process will have to constantly adapt to the changes. You will participate in actively contributing in building the process \\& tool chain too. You will have complete freedom here, but you will be subjected to reviews.
