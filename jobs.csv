The team’s responsibilities span request/response\\-based metadata distribution for various financial products (bonds, futures, options, FX spots/forwards, deposits, swaps, commodities, swaptions, cdx, cds, equities, etc), dealing with batch and on\\-demand security creation and updates, building infrastructure for keeping the metadata current and accurate, and providing multiple means of dissemination to downstream systems (such as analytics, risk, and trader systems). While not a low\\-latency system, it is perceived as a high availability cluster capable of serving both existing securities and securities created upon request based on external metadata.
   

  

 Team members interact directly with operations teams and other technology teams, so solid communication skills are essential. The team owns the entire software lifecycle, from requirements and design, through implementation, to production releases and support. Release cycles are tight, so in addition to strong development skills, you must have demonstrated the ability to adapt to changing conditions and learn quickly.
   

  

 There are no business analysts on the team, so we expect developers to have sufficient business and product knowledge to understand the requirements on their own. That being said, this is not a particularly Quantitative role – there is a separate Analytics team that undertakes valuation and related work. We focus more on building up and supporting the technical infrastructure.

Our invention of the GPU sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics, and revolutionized parallel computing. Today, research in artificial intelligence is booming worldwide, which calls for highly scalable and massively parallel computation horsepower that NVIDIA GPUs excel. NVIDIA is a “learning machine” that constantly evolves by adapting to new opportunities that are hard to solve, that only we can address, and that matter to the world. This is our life’s work , to amplify human creativity and intelligence. As an NVIDIAN, you’ll be immersed in a diverse, supportive environment where everyone is inspired to do their best work. Come join our diverse team and see how you can make a lasting impact on the world!
   

  

 On this team, you will use your passion for software engineering to design, implement, and debug the next generation of our GPU, SOC, and system simulation environments. This position involves crafting the core verification infrastructure in the development of a full\\-system platform for discrete graphics and computing chips. This object\\-oriented C\\+\\+ and System\\-C simulation infrastructure allows us to efficiently model and verify the world's largest chips using a sophisticated distributed\\- computing\\-based execution and triage environment. Come to NVIDIA and join our diverse, international, and fast\\-paced team to produce next\\-generation products following the highest production\\-quality standards.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* In this position, you will develop the environments to model and simulate next\\-generation GPU and SoC systems, and add features long before they are built into a product or implemented in driver software. You will also support the architecture and engineering teams that use this environment. Bring your love for solving meaningful problems, as every day will be different!
* You will work alongside colleagues from architecture, hardware, and software to unlock the functionality and performance of next\\-generation NVIDIA chips.
* Our team participates in the entire chip development and release lifecycle, starting from the architectural specification through to verification, and finally to production


**What We Need To See**
* Bachelors or Masters in computer science/computer engineering or equivalent experience
* 4 or more years of professional object\\-oriented C\\+\\+ programming and System\\-C simulation/modeling experience
* Experience with Transaction Level Modeling a plus
* Background with Verilog, System Verilog, or other forms of RTL simulation is a plus
* Experience in software development lifecycle on Linux\\-based platforms preferred
* Understanding of computer and memory system architecture
* Excellent communication skills. We work with colleagues from around the world every day


 NVIDIA offers highly competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package. We have some of the most talented and hard\\-working people in the world working for us and, due to unprecedented growth, our extraordinary engineering teams are growing fast. If you're a creative and autonomous engineer with a real passion for technology, we want to hear from you.
