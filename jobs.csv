**Roku is changing how the world watches TV** 

 Roku is the \\#1 TV streaming platform in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and we've set our sights on powering every television in the world. Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.
 



 From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable \\- and valued \\- contribution. We're a fast\\-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.
 



  
 


**About the team**


 The observability team is an integral part of Roku’s central Infrastructure Engineering team, which oversees the service mesh hosting architecture and observability platform that lives on that platform. Together, we are tasked with developing and scaling both the Platform (Kubernetes, Istio, Envoy, operators, etc.) and the Observability stack (OSS/CNCF\\-supported observability projects). Our goal is to facilitate Roku’s shift towards a unified, cloud\\-agnostic infrastructure where all teams benefit from a common framework with out of the box features.
 





 Within the observability team, we are dedicated to creating a world\\-class observability platform. We customize and optimize OSS projects to meet our needs and actively contribute to upstream projects, promoting positive changes and engaging with the broader ecosystem. We even write software ourselves when there isn’t a good OSS option.
 




  
 


**About the role**

  
 


 Do you want to help build the next generation of Roku’s observability platform? Are you familiar with the CNCF open\\-source ecosystem of observability tools for metrics, logs, and tracing? Do you enjoy collaborating with other teams to enhance their observability experience, while handling large\\-scale operations to manage high\\-volume data and requests across multiple regions and clusters? If so, this role is for you!
 





  
 



**What you’ll be doing:**
* Work closely with the Service Mesh team to identify and standardize on existing and new observability tools as part of a holistic solution.
* Work on, enhance, and expand our diverse stack of components that operate across multiple clouds, regions, and clusters, managing all observability data.
* You will have the freedom and tools to drive improvements and make changes.
* Perform feature/functionality/usability trials of new observability tools that can benefit Roku.
* Contribute new open\\-source tools and/or improvements to existing open\\-source tools back to the CNCF ecosystem.
* Design and build automation and/or custom features in and around the chosen tools to make onboarding new services easy, improve UIX and the general
 

 experience for developers.
* Demonstrate great communication skills in working with technical and non\\-technical audiences.




  
 



**We’re excited if you have:**
* 8\\+ years of experience in either Infrastructure engineering, DevOps and/or Software Engineering.
* Recent experience designing and building unified observability platforms that enable companies to use the sometimes\\-overwhelming amount of available data (metrics, logs, and traces) to determine quickly if their application or service is operating as desired.
* Expertise in deploying and using open\\-source observability tools in large scale environments, including Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Thanos, or similar tools such as Cortex, Mimir, ELK (Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana) stack, etc.
* Expertise in at least one of the observability pillars; (distributed) tracing, logs, metrics, profiling/APM.
* Familiarity with the open standard OpenTelemetry.
* Familiarity with Kubernetes and Istio as the architecture on which the observability platform runs, and how they integrate and scale. Additionally, the ability to contribute improvements back to the joint platform for the benefit of all teams.
* Demonstrated customer engagement and collaboration skills to curate custom dashboards and views, and identify and deploy new tools, to meet their requirements.
* The drive and self\\-motivation to understand the intricate details of a complex infrastructure environment.
* Hands on experience working with AWS and/or GCP.
* Experience with Go.
* B.S. or M.S. degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or equivalent experience.
* You have either tried Gen AI in your previous work or outside of work or are curious about Gen AI and have explored it.


  
 

**Benefits** 

 Roku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter.
 



  
 


**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.
