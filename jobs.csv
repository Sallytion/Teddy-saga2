* Ability to work with codebases in Bash, TypeScript and Go.
* Excellent debugging skills.
* Source control experience including branching, merging and rebasing.
* The ability to break down complex problems into smaller pieces, provide options, talk through trade\\-offs and drive the effort to solve the problem.


**Bonus Points**

**Athenian Project** 
 : In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.
   

  

**1\\.1\\.1\\.1** 
 : We released 1\\.1\\.1\\.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy\\-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use \\- it is the first consumer\\-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal \\- we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
