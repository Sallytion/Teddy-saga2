In 2026, we’re making daily, transaction‑level cash reconciliation the standard across our businesses, shipping a unified recon interface that spans cash and crypto, standardizing external bank and processor data with enforceable quality contracts, and compressing finance reviews to a single clean iteration.
 



 As a Senior Software Engineer at Coinbase,  you will join our team to build out the next generation of crypto\\-forward products and features. You will solve unique, large scale, highly complex technical problems, bridging the constraints posed by web\\-scale applications and blockchain technology. You will help build the next generation of systems to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone across the globe, operating real\\-time applications with high frequency, low latency updates, and managing the most secure, dockerized infrastructure running in the cloud.

 You’re a frontend engineer who knows how to ship clean, fast, and reliable user experiences. You build components that scale, automate your testing, and care deeply about accessibility, performance, and maintainability. You’re collaborative, direct, and unafraid to ask questions or challenge assumptions. You help others level up, and you’re driven by delivering value, not chasing perfection for its own sake.
   

 You’ll work deeply within one core portal, so you need to understand its users, its flows, and its constraints. You make clear decisions, align with the right stakeholders, and communicate your reasoning so the portal keeps moving forward with purpose.
   

 Preferred technical skills
   

 5\\+ years of professional experience building modern web applications
   

 Deep expertise in React, component architecture, state management (Redux, Zustand, Recoil, or similar), and hooks
   

 Strong command of TypeScript and clean, maintainable frontend code
   

 Solid experience with design systems, reusable components, and accessibility standards (WCAG)
   

 Modern styling approaches (CSS Modules, Tailwind, Styled Components, etc.)
   

 Proven ability to build high\\-performance UIs
   

 Experience consuming and designing REST and GraphQL APIs
   

 Automated testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright/Cypress
   

 CI/CD pipelines and modern deployment workflows
   

 Knowledge of edge runtimes, CDN optimisations, caching strategies
   

 Comfortable with observability: logging, monitoring, debugging client issues
   

 Understanding of security best practices for frontend apps (XSS, CSP, OAuth flows, etc.)
   

  

 A day in your life with us
   

  

 We’re a unique company that gives you space to fit in and enables you to make use of your skills. Our systems are being used by over 170,000 co\\-workers and serve over 4 billion customers globally!
   

 We’re in the midst of the transformation from legacy monoliths to an event\\-driven cloud architecture. You wouldn’t have dealt with as many orders as go through our system (and if you have – talk to me!), so scalability becomes second nature, for both performance and cost.There are heaps of challenges in front of us, but we’re prepared and look forward to becoming truly agile with modern architecture – and maybe with your help. We’re not chasing shareholder value; we want to help the many people to have a better everyday life. Order Management – you might know it, or you might have no clue! Either is fine, as we’ll help you to get an understanding and find your ways around creating, executing, releasing, and deviating orders. This won’t get boring thanks to the many different flows and integrations in our omni\\-channel setup! We aim to have driven, empowered agile teams who understand priorities and how to come to agreements with other teams and domains. We’re all in this together and we try to help others and share our knowledge often. We want to become the best in class – yes, that’s a lofty goal, but why aim for less? If you feel the same then you’ll fit right in, come and help us push boundaries! We have values and we live them – they’re all important and I’m happy to share them with you in more detail, but these stand out for me:
   

 Togetherness, Simplicity, leading by example, and different with a meaning – get in touch and I can explain in detail!
