 Turing is seeking experienced Rust developers to partner with a leading AI research lab in building safer, more reliable coding workflows. In this role, you’ll work on real\\-world Rust codebases to implement new features, debug ownership and concurrency issues, and design comprehensive tests that stress memory safety and correctness.
 



  





 This is a
 **fully remote, highly flexible opportunity — work from anywhere** 
 , on your own schedule. It’s a chance to apply your Rust expertise to frontier AI research, shaping how AI learns to generate and reason about systems\\-level code.
 



  





**What You’ll Do:** 



* Implement and refine features in production\\-grade Rust codebases.
* Diagnose, debug, and resolve ownership, borrowing, and concurrency challenges.
* Design comprehensive tests (unit, integration, property\\-based) to enforce safety.
* Improve development environments, dependencies, and performance.
* Document trade\\-offs and guide architectural decisions.



  





**What We’re Looking For:** 



* 2\\+ years of professional Rust within 3\\+ years total industry experience.
* Strong grasp of ownership, lifetimes, async/multithreading, and memory safety.
* Skilled in Rust testing frameworks, profiling, and debugging.
* Ability to refactor and improve large Rust codebases.
* Excellent problem\\-solving skills and clear English communication.



  





**Why You'll Love This Role:** 



* **Remote \\& Flexible** 
 → Work from anywhere, on your schedule.
* **Career Edge** 
 → Build deep Rust expertise at the intersection of systems and AI.
* **High\\-Impact Work** 
 → Shape how frontier AI models learn safe, concurrent Rust.



  





**About Turing:** 




 Based in San Francisco, California, Turing is the world’s leading research accelerator for frontier AI labs and a trusted partner for global enterprises deploying advanced AI systems.
 



  





**Turing supports customers in two ways:** 
 first, by accelerating frontier research with high\\-quality data, advanced training pipelines, plus top AI researchers who specialize in software engineering, logical reasoning, STEM, multilinguality, multimodality, and agents; and second, by applying that expertise to help enterprises transform AI from proof of concept into proprietary intelligence with systems that perform reliably, deliver measurable impact, and drive lasting results on the P\\&L.
