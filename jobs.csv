 Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.
   

  

 Since 2012, we have built the market\\-leading cloud security company and an award\\-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Paris, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive. Visit us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter@Netskope.

 As a Staff Engineer, you will design and implement sophisticated systems that leverage cutting\\-edge AI/ML techniques, graph\\-based analytics, and real\\-time data processing to solve critical security challenges. You will work on problems spanning threat detection, risk assessment, behavioral analytics, and intelligent automation—building the systems that help security teams at the world's largest enterprises detect and respond to threats.
   

  

 This role requires deep technical expertise with strong hands\\-on implementation skills. You will collaborate closely with Distinguished Engineers, Senior engineers, Product managers, and security researchers to deliver production\\-quality solutions that operate at massive scale. Your code and architectural decisions will directly impact how thousands of organizations protect their critical assets.
   

  

**What’s In It For You**
 We are looking for a highly motivated, skillful, and hands\\-on Staff UI Developer to take ownership of the next generation of user experiences for our Agentic AI platform.

If you possess the technical depth of a developer, the foresight of an architect, and the proven ability to lead complex initiatives, we would like to speak with you about this exciting, impactful opportunity.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Participate actively in deep technical design discussions, driving the product direction and long\\-term strategy specifically for the Agentic AI platform's user experience (UI) and API Gateway.
* Maintain code quality and design integrity by conducting rigorous code reviews and diving into the codebase as necessary to optimize architecture and troubleshoot complex distributed issues.
* Provide technical leadership and strategic direction for the overall Netskope UI and the API Gateway components interacting with the Agentic AI models.
* Collaborate effectively across organizational boundaries (Product Management, Backend AI/ML teams) to ensure a shared roadmap and streamlined, end\\-to\\-end delivery of Agentic AI features.
* Refine and grow existing processes, or develop new workflows, to enable the smooth and efficient functioning of the UI engineering team supporting the AI initiatives.
* Collaborate with the geo\\-distributed team to own and deliver high\\-impact projects that connect the Agentic AI backend to the user interface, ensuring successful end\\-to\\-end deployment.
* Collaborating with the geo\\-distributed team to own and deliver projects end\\-to\\-end.
* Communicating across functional teams and driving engineering initiatives.
