* Don’t be! We’re building the first Operating System for Global Trade. That’s why it’s incredibly important for us to bring people from diverse backgrounds and experiences together with our industry veterans to help move the freight forwarding industry forward.
* What’s freight forwarding and why does it matter? Freight forwarding is the coordination and shipment of goods from one place to another and it’s what makes global trade possible. Flexport is on a mission to make global trade easier for everyone because we believe it can help connect the world and break down economic barriers.
* We know this industry is complex. That’s why we invest in education starting day one with Flexport Academy, a one\\-week intensive onboarding program designed specifically to set every new Flexport employee up for success.

 Thales is a global technology leader trusted by governments, institutions, and enterprises to tackle their most demanding challenges. From quantum applications and artificial intelligence to cybersecurity and 6G innovation, our solutions empower critical decisions rooted in human intelligence. Operating at the forefront of aerospace and space, cybersecurity and digital identity, we’re driven by a mission to build a future we can all trust.
   

  

 Present in India since 1953, Thales is headquartered in Noida and has other operational offices and sites spread across Delhi, Gurugram, Bengaluru and Mumbai, among others. Over 2200 employees are working with Thales and its joint ventures in India. Since the beginning, Thales has been playing an essential role in India’s growth story by sharing its technologies and expertise in Defence, Aerospace and Cyber \\& Digital sectors. Thales has two engineering competence centres in India \\- one in Noida focused on Cyber \\& Digital business, while the one in Bengaluru focuses on hardware, software and systems engineering capabilities for both the civil and defence sectors, serving global needs. The Group has also established an MRO (Maintenance, Repair \\& Overhaul) facility in Gurugram to provide comprehensive avionics maintenance and repair services to Indian airlines and support the growth of the local aviation industry.
   

  

**About The Product**
 Advanced Bot Protection defends mission\\-critical websites, mobile apps, and APIs from automated threats \\- bad bots \\- without affecting the flow of business\\-critical traffic.
   

  

 Bad bots are purpose\\-built to attack organizations’ websites and mobile apps through web scraping, account takeover, transaction fraud, denial of service, competitive data mining, unauthorized vulnerability scans, spam, click fraud, and web and mobile API abuse.
   

  

 A unique security concern, the bot problem is focused on abuse of business functionality rather than finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.
   

  

**About The Team**
 We are a team of programmers based around Stockholm, responsible for developing real\\-time bot detection software, data processing pipelines, and customer\\-facing tools. Our team works according to modern development practices and our main language is Rust. We also have frontends, and browser/mobile SDKs for Android and iOS. We operate a global infrastructure and deploy daily, and we work closely with data scientists and cybersecurity threat researchers.
   

  

**About You**
 We are now looking for a person who wants to help us in strengthening our defences against bad bots. You have an analytical and creative mindset and can approach problems from new angles. Most likely, you enjoy exploring new technologies and use them to your advantage, rather than being heavily specialized in a few areas.
   

  

**Expectations:**
* Minimum of 5 years’ experience developing and delivering distributed systems
* Solid experience and understanding of mobile devices and SDKs
* Experience in Cloud environment, preferably AWS
* Strong experience and knowledge in JavaScript


**Advantage:**
* Experience with web browser technologies
* Experience with cybersecurity
* Interest or experience in Rust


**Responsibilities:**
* Develop and maintain bot protection integrations, including mobile SDK for iOS and Android
* Develop and maintain automated threat mitigation
* Support customers with integration and related issues
* Research and implement new capabilities and detections


 At Thales, we’re committed to fostering a workplace where respect, trust, collaboration, and passion drive everything we do. Here, you’ll feel empowered to bring your best self, thrive in a supportive culture, and love the work you do. Join us, and be part of a team reimagining technology to create solutions that truly make a difference – for a safer, greener, and more inclusive world.","Aviation and Aerospace Component Manufacturing and Defense and Space Manufacturing","https://fr.linkedin.com/company/thales","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQEmnUAXTuLkJQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1631366051478/thales_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=5Fjph8Uvqt0JzMLDdQwZUvfp1ylQY1jAxb6MS59uuwE","","","","","","","","","","",""
