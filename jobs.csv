 As a Software Development Engineer 2 you are in a mid\\-level Individual Contributor role at Tesco.

SDE2 is a stepping stone towards SDE3, rather than a career destination in its own right.At this level, your impact reaches across a team, and you provide technical leadership of medium to large features. You are starting to produce your own work by understanding the problems that the team faces and are beginning to support other engineers with their own delivery and development. You prioritise sharing your skills and knowledge. You also prioritise quality of work, helping your team to continually set the standard. You understand and apply best practice within Tesco and across the industry.

 At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team.
   

 I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code.
   

 I have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing these within my team.

 As a Software Development Engineer 2 you are in a mid\\-level Individual Contributor role at Tesco. Engineers at SDE2 level will continue their career development and show potential for an SDE3 role. SDE2 is a stepping stone towards SDE3, rather than a career destination in its own right.At this level, your impact reaches across a team, and you provide technical leadership of medium to large features. You are starting to produce your own work by understanding the problems that the team faces and are beginning to support other engineers with their own delivery and development. You prioritise sharing your skills and knowledge. You also prioritise quality of work, helping your team to continually set the standard. You understand and apply best practice within Tesco and across the industry.
   

  

**You will be responsible for**
 My impact reaches across the team in which I work. I provide technical leadership of medium to large features, participating in their design and taking accountability for their delivery.

I work within my team, utilising data driven decision making techniques, to encouraging optimal outcomes whilst accepting appropriate trade\\-offs.
   

 I am comfortable both supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on major components or small services as appropriate. At this level I display a degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team and am experienced enough to know when I need support. I am able to identify risks and raise these as appropriate.
   

 At this level I am beginning to support, coach, and mentor those around me. As junior engineers join the team, I am assisting them through their onboarding process and leaning on my past experience to help get them up to speed. Whilst I may not formally be a mentor for other engineers, I am someone that individuals across the team will come to for advice and help. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across my team.
   

 I contribute to the raising the quality bar of my team’s codebase, both in the code that I produce and by helping to peer review code written by other team members. I proactively provide constructive and useful feedback to other team members on their code.
   

 I have a good understanding of best practices across the industry and of Tesco architectural standards. I make sure to put these principles and standards into practice when completing my work. I am aware of the best testing and deployment strategies in the industry and have a view on the suitability of implementing these within my team.
   

 I am comfortable working in a group context and am capable of communicating technical concepts to key stakeholders.

 Libra AI is building an Agentic WorkOS\\- a unified semantic layer across enterprise tools that enables AI agents to retrieve, reason, and execute work across the organization.
 



 We’re rethinking how knowledge flows inside companies. Instead of dashboards and fragmented SaaS, we’re building a system where agents operate across your stack with context, traceability, and control. We’ve raised a $1M pre\\-seed and are building the founding team.
 



  





**The Role** 




 This is not a “feature factory” role.
 



 As a Founding Engineer, you will:
 


* Architect core systems from first principles
* Design and build scalable backend infrastructure
* Work on agent orchestration, context graphs, and execution loops
* Ship product directly with the founder
* Own problems end\\-to\\-end (design → implementation → deployment)
* Influence technical direction and culture from day zero



  





**What We’re Looking For** 



* Strong CS fundamentals
* Experience building production systems (not just side projects)
* Comfort with ambiguity and 0→1 building
* Systems thinking mindset
* High agency and ownership
* Bonus: Experience with LLM systems, distributed systems, or infra



 We care more about depth and clarity of thinking than years of experience.
 



  





 Tech Stack (Evolving)
 


* Next.js / TypeScript
* Node / Python
* Supabase / Postgres
* AI model integrations
* Cloud\\-native infra



 Stack is flexible\\- architecture judgment matters more.
 



  





 Why This Is Interesting
 


* Build an execution OS, not another SaaS tool
* Small team, high velocity
* Direct founder collaboration
* Real equity at an early stage
* High leverage problems in AI infra



  





**Who Should NOT Apply** 



* If you need structured tickets and detailed specs for every task
* If you optimize for stability over impact
* If you want to be “one of many engineers”
* If you want to build something foundational in AI and shape a company from day one","Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/libra-ai-us","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHXQ6uz5HzlbA/company-logo_100_100/B56ZZcwvRJHsAQ-/0/1745313003126?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=jLXgyJIb7LMwvV3b_eHwEw9Gx1MCGpJWs5bi0g2zlwQ","","","","","","","","","","",""

**Working at Atlassian**
 Atlassians can choose where they work – whether in an office, from home, or a combination of the two. That way, Atlassians have more control over supporting their family, personal goals, and other priorities. We can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed\\-first company.
   

  

**Why should you apply to this role?**
 The Senior Enterprise Delivery Manager is responsible for ushering Atlassian’s largest, most complex customers through their transition into the cloud. As the primary stakeholder, you will act as a reliable strategic advisor and technical consultant to customer decision\\-makers, while also leading the delivery and governance of large\\-scale Cloud migrations.
   

  

 You bring both business acumen and technical fluency. You will work closely with customer stakeholders and cross\\-functional teams—including Sales, Solutions, Support, Product Management, Channel Partners, and Engineering—to help navigate architectural decisions, risk mitigation, performance guardrails, and adoption planning.
   

  

 This role is ideal for someone who thrives at the intersection of strategy, data, and execution — whether you come from delivery management, DevOps, QA/testing, or engineering. It requires proven expertise in developing and influencing customer cloud strategies and enabling technical adoption of cloud features, including AI. You understand how data moves, systems integrate, and migrations succeed (or fail). You will identify potential challenges and implement effective solutions that guide toward positive outcomes and ultimately lead Atlassian’s most strategic customers to Cloud.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Migration Strategy: Lead end\\-to\\-end cloud transformation engagements by evaluating customer environments and aligning technical execution with business outcomes.
* Risk Management: Facilitate migration readiness assessments, interpret guardrail results, and recommend actionable remediations (i.e. SQL\\-based analysis, app remediations, automation deltas, workflow redesign).
* Technical Architecture: Understand and communicate the role of APIs, webhooks, and automation components in customer environments — explaining how they translate to Cloud and what requires refactor or replacement.
* Trusted Advisor: Act as a trusted advisor to senior leadership and other technical executives, guiding decision\\-making through data\\-backed insights.
* Delivery Excellence: Govern the migration lifecycle through disciplined execution, measurable outcomes, and coordination with support \\& engineering teams — from discovery to UAT completion and go\\-live.
* Drive Accountability: Drive team accountability through clearly defined milestones, transparent reporting, proactive risk management and optimal resourcing.
* Stakeholder Management: Lead all project communications, plan reviews, and steering committee to guide project direction. Maintain effective communication with stakeholders to advocate for the team and meet customer objectives.
* Escalation Management: Act as the escalation point for customers to drive urgency on critical blockers during migrations.


**Industry Insight:** 
 Stay ahead of industry trends and integrate insights into customer interactions. Propose innovative solutions to business challenges.
   

  

**Qualifications**
* 12\\+ years of professional experience as a technical program/delivery manager responsible for complex technology projects for enterprise customers.
* Extensive experience working in or around software delivery — roles such as Delivery Manager, DevOps Engineer, QA/Test Lead, Systems Engineer, or Support Lead are a plus
* Proven track record leading data migration, systems integrations, or platform transformations.
* Knowledge of APIs, automations, and integration patterns, including how they translate between on\\-prem and cloud.
* Strong understanding of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) — able to connect process, tooling, and delivery outcomes.
* Strong ability to influence customer decision\\-making through expertise in delivery knowledge and value discussions.
* Skilled in negotiating effectively with senior\\-level decision\\-makers.
* Bachelor’s or advanced degree in engineering, computer science, or equivalent professional experience.
