* Software Engineering with Agentic AI: You will design and build sophisticated multi\\-agent systems from the ground up to automate complex segments of our SDLC. Your primary toolkit will include state\\-of\\-the\\-art frameworks like LangGraph for building stateful, cyclical agentic architectures, alongside CrewAI for multi\\-agent collaboration. Your work will involve:
+ Implementing Advanced Agentic Patterns: You will move beyond simple ReAct loops to design complex systems involving dynamic planning, self\\-reflection, and hierarchical tool use. You will build a robust library of custom tools (e.g., functions to interact with our codebase, databases, and internal APIs) that agents can intelligently select and execute.
+ Building Goal\\-Oriented AI Agents: You will design, build, and deploy autonomous systems such as:
- A ""DevOps Agent"" that can autonomously diagnose production alerts by querying logs via the Splunk/Datadog API, inspect infrastructure state using the GCP API, and execute remediation plans like rolling back a deployment on GKE.
- A ""Code Generation \\& Refactoring Agent"" that takes a Jira ticket as input, writes the initial Python implementation using FastAPI, generates corresponding unit tests with Pytest, runs the tests, and then iteratively refactors the code based on feedback from static analysis tools.


**Qualifications**
* Experience: 10\\+ years of professional software engineering experience, with a proven track record of designing, building, and operating large\\-scale, distributed systems in a production environment.
* Technical Leadership: Demonstrated experience as a technical lead, principal engineer, or staff engineer, where you were responsible for the architectural direction of a team or major project and mentored fellow engineers.
* Expert\\-Level Python: Deep, authoritative knowledge of Python and its ecosystem. You have extensive experience building high\\-performance backend services (e.g., with FastAPI, gRPC), data\\-intensive applications, and understand the nuances of the language . You write clean, performant, and testable code and have extensive experience with modern backend frameworks (FastAPI, Pydantic), testing tools (Pytest), and high\\-performance data libraries (Pandas 2\\.0\\+).
* Architectural Depth: You are a systems thinker that deeply understands their trade\\-offs. You have a proven history of architecting for resilience, scalability, and maintainability. You are a vocal advocate for best practices in API design, data modeling, and clean code. A history of designing modular, decoupled systems (e.g., microservices, event\\-driven architecture). You think in terms of APIs, data contracts, and long\\-term maintainability.
* Production AI/ML Expertise: Proven, hands\\-on experience in productionizing machine learning systems (MLOps). You have deep familiarity with the challenges of deploying and monitoring ML models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs). You have expertise in the MLOps lifecycle, including hands\\-on experience with tools like MLflow, Kubeflow, KServe/KFServing, and the unique challenges of productionizing LLMs.
* Cloud \\& Infrastructure Proficiency: Extensive experience with cloud platforms, primarily Google Cloud (GCP) or any cloud platform. You are an expert in containerization (Docker, Kubernetes/GKE) and infrastructure\\-as\\-code (Terraform).
