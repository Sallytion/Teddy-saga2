 Climate change is a global challenge affecting every human and every ecosystem. Solving it requires clean, scalable, and deeply reliable energy systems. Nuclear fission is one of the world’s most powerful pathways to deep decarbonization, but unlocking its full potential demands tools and technologies that significantly elevate safety, accuracy, and operator preparedness.
 



  





 At PolyEnergetics, our long\\-term vision is to build safer and more efficient nuclear fission reactors using AI. The pathway to that future begins with AI copilots, immersive operator training, and high\\-fidelity digital twins —systems that enhance situational awareness, reduce human error, and make complex reactor behavior more predictable and transparent.
 



  





 Passionate about driving progress without harming the planet? Join us!
 



  





**About the role** 




  





**Build quality into cutting\\-edge AI, Web \\& VR products** 




  





 We are an
 **early\\-stage startup** 
 building ambitious products across
 **web platforms, AI chatbots, and immersive VR experiences** 
 . We’re looking for a
 **passionate QA Engineer who treats quality as a product feature, not a checkbox** 
 .
 



  





 This role is not about “running test cases handed to you.” It’s about
 **owning quality end\\-to\\-end** 
 , shaping test strategy, and working closely with engineers and product teams to ensure users experience reliability, polish, and trust from day one.
 



 If you enjoy finding subtle issues, thinking like a user
 *and* 
 a system designer, and building processes that scale—this role is for you.
 



  





**What you’ll do** 



* **Own the quality lifecycle** 
 for web, AI chatbot, and VR\\-related products
* Design
 **clear, thorough, and maintainable test cases** 
 that reflect real user behavior and edge cases
* Execute test cases, analyze results, and create
 **actionable test reports with clear prioritization and risk assessment**
* Partner closely with developers and product managers to
 **catch issues early** 
 , not just at release time
* Identify repetitive or stable flows and
 **progressively automate mature test processes**
* Evaluate, adopt, and refine
 **QA tools and frameworks** 
 best suited for different testing needs (manual, API, automation, chatbot, etc.)
* Continuously improve testing practices as the product and team evolve



  





**Required experience** 



* **2–4 years of hands\\-on experience** 
 in a QA / Software Testing role
* Strong experience in
 **test case and test suite management** 
 (TestRail or similar tools)
* Manual testing experience for
 **web applications and AI/chatbot\\-based interfaces**
* **API testing** 
 using Postman or similar tools
* **Web test automation** 
 using Cypress or comparable frameworks
* Defect tracking and collaboration using
 **JIRA or similar issue\\-tracking tools**



  





**Good to have (strong plus, not mandatory)** 



* Experience testing
 **AI chatbots, conversational flows, games, or VR/3D environments**
* Familiarity with chatbot testing tools such as
 **Botium**
* Engineering or science background (Physics / Mechanical / Electrical)
* Exposure to early\\-stage startups or fast\\-moving product teams



  





**What we value in you** 



* **Exceptional observation skills** 
 – you notice what others miss
* **Clear, precise communication** 
 – you can explain issues without ambiguity
* **High discipline and ownership** 
 – you don’t wait to be told what “good quality” looks like
* A mindset of
 **continuous improvement** 
 , not rigid process
* Curiosity about
 **how systems behave** 
 , not just whether they pass or fail



  





**Why this role is different** 



* **You work directly with the founding team**
* You’ll have
 **real influence** 
 over how quality is defined and built
* You’ll work on
 **modern tech** 
 : AI, conversational systems, and VR—not just CRUD apps
* You won’t be boxed into “manual vs automation”—you’ll decide what makes sense
