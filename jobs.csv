 P.S: We highly recommend reading The ""API\\-First World"" graphic novel to understand the bigger picture and our vision at Postman.
   

  

**About The Team**
 The Integrations Team is responsible for enabling seamless connectivity between Postman and the broader developer ecosystem — from version control and CI/CD tools to messaging platforms, monitoring systems, gateways, and more. You’ll help build robust integration layers, APIs, and tooling that allow users and organisations to plug Postman into their end\\-to\\-end workflows with minimal friction.
   

  

 What You’ll Be Doing
   

  

 As a Senior Engineer on the Integrations Team, you will:
   

  

* Design, build and optimise integration infrastructure and APIs that connect Postman to external systems — e.g., version control, CI/CD, monitoring/alerting, gateways, messaging tools.
* Work closely with product managers, designers, platform engineers, support and QA to deliver integration features that scale globally.
* Own the full lifecycle of integration development — from specification, architecture, implementation, deployment, monitoring and maintenance.
* Mentor and review the code of peers; advocate best practices in engineering, API design, performance, reliability, scalability and observability.
* Research and evaluate evolving standards, protocols and technologies relevant to integrations (webhooks, REST, GraphQL, event\\-driven systems, SDKs, CLI, plugin frameworks).
* Identify opportunities to build internal tools or frameworks that simplify building, deploying and maintaining integrations.


**About You**
* 6\\+ years of experience building and shipping complex distributed software applications (backend systems, APIs, integrations) at scale.
* Strong proficiency with JavaScript/TypeScript and Node.js, and experience building backend services and REST\\-based APIs.
* Solid understanding of web fundamentals, messaging/event systems, asynchronous processing, performance optimisation.

* Proven track record of shipping products or features from scratch, owning end\\-to\\-end.
* You have a product\\-oriented mindset and empathy for users and their workflows.
* You enjoy learning, sharing knowledge and collaborating across teams.
* Bonus: Prior experience building integrations with external tools or platforms; familiarity with CI/CD ecosystems, monitoring/alerting systems, or plugin architectures.


**What Else?**
 In addition to Postman's pay\\-on\\-performance philosophy, and a flexible schedule working with a fun, collaborative team, Postman offers a comprehensive set of benefits, including full medical coverage, flexible PTO, wellness reimbursement, and a monthly lunch stipend. Along with that, our wellness programs will help you stay in the best of your physical and mental health. Our frequent and fascinating team\\-building events will keep you connected, while our donation\\-matching program can support the causes you care about. We’re building a long\\-term company with an inclusive culture where everyone can be the best version of themselves.
   

  

 At Postman, we embrace a hybrid work model. For all roles based out of San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Bangalore, Hyderabad, London, and New York, employees are expected to come into the office 3\\-days a week. We were thoughtful in our approach which is based on balancing flexibility and collaboration and grounded in feedback from our workforce, leadership team, and peers. The benefits of our hybrid office model will be shared knowledge, brainstorming sessions, communication, and building trust in\\-person that cannot be replicated via zoom.
   

  

**Our Values**
 At Postman, we create with the same curiosity that we see in our users. We value transparency and honest communication about not only successes, but also failures. In our work, we focus on specific goals that add up to a larger vision. Our inclusive work culture ensures that everyone is valued equally as important pieces of our final product.

This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""
