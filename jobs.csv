**Role Title:** 
 QA Engineer — Zenara Health
   

  

**Location:** 
 Remote across India (works US Pacific hours)
   

  

**Type:** 
 Full\\-time
   

  

**About the Company:**
 Zenara Health is a technology\\-driven mental health care company dedicated to transforming access and quality of mental wellness services. The company combines AI\\-powered platforms with expert clinical care to deliver personalized, effective mental health solutions. Zenara Health strives to innovate and improve mental health outcomes by connecting patients and providers through a seamless digital experience.
   

  

**The Role**
 This is partnership, not just testing.
   

  

 Be the guardian of quality across our software. Own QA — manual, automated, AI\\-assisted, and process\\-driven — so every release is reliable, performant, and secure. You'll turn complex requirements into test plans, enforce standards, leverage AI to move faster without cutting corners, and prevent defects before they reach clinicians and patients.
   

  

 We don't want someone who runs tests. We want someone who
 *thinks* 
 about quality — and uses every tool available, including AI, to guarantee it.
   

  

**A Day in Flow (The Feel, Not a Script)**
* Two\\-minute check\\-in — tests executed, defects found, one risk escalated
* During sprints: convert feature specs into test plans \\+ actionable results before the day ends. Use AI tools to generate initial test cases from requirements, then refine with your expertise
* After: bugs logged and tracked, regression suites updated, CI/CD pipelines verified, polite reminders sent. Quiet confidence, zero drama


**What You'll Own**
**Manual \\& Automated Testing** 
 — Develop and execute test plans for web and mobile applications. Build and maintain automated test suites that scale.
   

  

**AI\\-Accelerated QA** 
 — Use AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Codium/CodiumAI, Testim, Katalon, or similar) to generate test cases from specs, auto\\-generate edge\\-case scenarios, accelerate test script creation, and reduce repetitive manual effort. Continuously evaluate new AI\\-powered QA tools and bring recommendations to the team.
   

  

**Bug Tracking \\& Resolution** 
 — Log, track, and verify defects using Jira, Azure DevOps, or similar. Prioritize ruthlessly.
   

  

**Test Design \\& Documentation** 
 — Maintain scripts, test cases, and reports that the whole team can understand and trust.
   

  

**Cross\\-Team Influence** 
 — Collaborate with developers, product managers, and security teams to reproduce, troubleshoot, and resolve issues. Be the quality voice in every sprint.
   

  

**Performance \\& Regression Testing** 
 — Ensure reliability under normal and peak conditions. Continuously expand regression coverage through automation.
   

  

**Compliance \\& Standards** 
 — HIPAA, security best practices, and healthcare regulations. Ensure audit readiness is a default state, not a scramble.
   

  

**Process Improvement** 
 — Advocate for quality across teams, drive continuous improvements, and champion AI adoption in the QA workflow.
   

  

**Authority (Ramped on Purpose)**
 You'll set quality standards from day one. Scope ramps as you deliver: approve or decline release readiness, enforce testing guidelines, and escalate risks early — with our full backing.
   

  

**What Success Looks Like**
* Defects caught before production — consistently
* Regression coverage is high, with AI\\-assisted and automated tests measurably reducing manual workload
* QA processes adopted across the team without slowing feature delivery
* AI tools integrated into the QA pipeline, with demonstrable time savings
* Compliance and audit readiness ensured at all times


**Schedule**
 Daytime hours with 4\\-8 hours of overlap to US Pacific, with flexibility for critical releases or audits.
   

  

**Requirements**
**Values \\& Vibe (Who You Are)**
 Meticulous, collaborative, and proactive — who also ships results. You enforce quality with kind authority, make testing practices accessible, and help the team deliver software they can trust. You're the amplifier for a creative engineering team that never compromises patient safety or reliability.
   

  

 You're also curious about how AI is reshaping QA. You don't use AI as a buzzword — you use it as a lever. You've already experimented with AI\\-powered test generation, copilot\\-assisted scripting, or intelligent defect triage, and you're looking for a team that wants to go further.
   

  

**What You've Done**
**Required:**
* 2\\-4\\+ years in software QA (manual and automated)
* Strong understanding of SDLC, testing methodologies, and defect tracking
* Hands\\-on experience with test automation frameworks — Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright
* Demonstrated use of AI tools to accelerate testing — whether that's AI\\-generated test cases, copilot\\-assisted test scripting, intelligent test maintenance, or AI\\-driven exploratory testing. We want to see that you've actually used these tools, not just read about them
* Familiarity with REST APIs and API testing tools (Postman, etc.)
* Excellent attention to detail and structured problem\\-solving


**Preferred:**
* Healthcare IT experience or understanding of HIPAA/compliance requirements
* Cloud familiarity (Azure)
* CI/CD pipeline knowledge — you understand where QA fits in the deployment flow
* Performance and load testing experience (JMeter, k6, or similar)
* ISTQB or other QA certifications
* Experience evaluating and rolling out new QA tools or processes across a team

 Location: On\\-site (Noida)
 



 Company: Proeffico Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
 



 Product: Vizo361 – AI Video Analytics Platform
 



  





**About Us** 




 We are building Vizo361, an AI Video Analytics platform that turns CCTV cameras into intelligent decision systems.
 



 Our system already includes modules like:
 



 • Fire \\& smoke detection
 



 • Facial recognition based attendance
 



 • Footfall analytics
 



 • Human activity monitoring
 



 • Industrial safety monitoring (PPE, restricted zones, etc.)
 



  





**We are not a service company — we are building a product \\+ AI infrastructure stack.** 




  





 This internship is for someone who wants to become a real Computer Vision Engineer, not just run pre\\-trained models.
 



  





**Role Overview** 




  





 You will work directly on real production video streams and help us build, train, deploy and optimize computer vision systems.
 



 Your work will go into an actual deployed product used by clients — not academic assignments.
 



  





**You will deal with:** 




 • noisy CCTV feeds
 



 • low light conditions
 



 • motion blur
 



 • real\\-time inference constraints
 



 • GPU memory limits
 



 • model failures in real environments
 



  





 This role is closer to AI systems engineering than pure research.
 



  





**What You Will Do** 




 • Work on real\\-time video analytics pipelines
 



 • Train and fine\\-tune detection/recognition models
 



 • Implement tracking (multi\\-object tracking)
 



 • Build dataset pipelines (annotation → training → evaluation → improvement)
 



 • Optimize inference latency on GPU/CPU edge systems
 



 • Integrate AI models into backend services
 



 • Debug model failures from production footage
 



 • Work with RTSP/RTMP camera streams
 



  





**You will also:** 




 • handle bad datasets
 



 • fix broken annotations
 



 • analyze false positives
 



 • improve accuracy iteratively
 



  





**Must Have (Very Important)** 




  





 We do not select candidates based only on knowing YOLO/OpenCV.
 



  





 You must know basic engineering tools:
 



  





**Core Skills** 




 • Python (good understanding, not just notebooks)
 



 • Linux command line (navigation, permissions, services, logs)
 



 • Git (branching, pull requests, resolving conflicts)
 



 • Debugging mindset
 



  





**Computer Vision** 




 • OpenCV
 



 • Image processing basics
 



 • Object detection concepts (bounding boxes, IoU, NMS)
 



 • Understanding of how training works (datasets, epochs, overfitting, augmentation)
 



  





**Good to Have** 




 • YOLO / Detectron / MMDetection
 



 • PyTorch
 



 • Video streaming (RTSP/FFmpeg/GStreamer)
 



 • Docker
 



 • Basic networking (ports, IP, NAT)
 



 • Model optimization (TensorRT / ONNX)
 



  





**What We Expect (Very Important)** 




  





 We are not looking for certificate collectors.
 



  





 You should:
 



 • be comfortable reading GitHub repositories
 



 • run models from source
