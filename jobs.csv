Founded in 2014 by Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar with a simple vision — to simplify payments for Indian businesses — we’ve since grown into a fintech powerhouse driving India’s digital payment revolution.
   

  

 Razorpay powers millions of businesses with a smarter, scalable stack that goes beyond transactions to help them truly build and grow.
   

  

 From seamless checkouts to payroll automation, across India, Singapore, and Malaysia, we’ve been engineering a fintech ecosystem that’s redefining how money moves across Asia — and we’re just getting started.
   

  

 Today, that ecosystem supports everyone from early\\-stage startups to some of India’s largest enterprises, enabling them to accept, process, and disburse payments at scale while expanding into new ways of managing money more efficiently.
   

  

 Our scale speaks volumes: Razorpay processes $180\\+ billion in annualized transactions, powering leading businesses like Airbnb, Facebook, WhatsApp, Airtel, CRED, BookmyShow, Zomato, Swiggy, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme — and over 100 of India’s unicorns. With strong roots in India and growing operations in Southeast Asia, we are shaping the next chapter of financial technology across the region.
   

  

 We are backed by global investors including GIC, Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India \\& SEA), Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, MasterCard, and Salesforce Ventures, having raised over $740 million to date. Strategic acquisitions — including Ezetap (POS and offline payments), Curlec (Malaysia expansion), BillMe (digital invoicing), and POP (rewards\\-first UPI) — along with earlier moves in fraud prevention, payroll, and lending, have further strengthened our platform and widened our footprint across Asia.
   

  

 But what truly sets Razorpay apart is our culture. At Razorpay, ownership is our oxygen — you own what you build, with no micromanagement or red tape, just the runway to make your ideas fly. Learning is a lifestyle — if you’re curious, you’ll feel at home here. People \\> Pedigree — we hire for attitude, hustle, and hunger more than degrees. Transparency thrives over titles — this is where interns question CXOs and CXOs say “thank you.” Guided by our values of Customer First, Autonomy \\& Ownership, Agility with Integrity, Transparency, Challenging the status quo and a strong belief that Razorpay grows with Razors, you’ll be part of a 3000\\+ strong team building not just products, but the financial infrastructure of the future.
   

  

**The Role**
 A Senior Software Development Engineer at Razorpay is well\\-grounded \\- smart, quality focussed, product thinker, business conscious \\- not mere coders, of course, with very good technical context and experience to write and build quality software. Engineering creates a significant impact across different areas, considering the scale of our software product outreach. You’re also expected to influence the culture of the company and help shape it in the right way.
   

  

**Roles And Responsibilities**
* Be involved and drive product \\& design discussions.
* Help us scale our payment infrastructure to get every Indian to pay online.
* Help us make decisions to shape our REST APIs for developers worldwide.
* Contribute to open source as we set the standards for mobile payments.
* Be involved and drive product \\& design discussions.
* And, most importantly, brainstorm and create new directions that Razorpay can take in our quest to make online payments easy and accessible to all.


**Mandatory Qualifications**
* 3\\+ years of experience in Technology.
* A strong product design sense.
* Good experience in working with any of the programming languages like PHP, Python, Django, Golang, Java, C\\+\\+
* Understand end\\-user requirements, formulate use cases and come up with effective solutions.
* Good understanding of REST APIs and the web in general.
* Ability to build a feature from scratch \\& drive it to completion.
* A willingness to learn new technology, whatever lets you deliver the best product.

 The following is how we approach each Core Value:
 


* **Authenticity** 
 – To be authentic means to be who we are and do it well. Focus your energy on being who YOU are. Be true to yourself. Authenticity also extends to our products. Understanding where we are truly the best fit for our customers and when we are not. And finally, authenticity in relationships: ensuring that we are honest and do what we say we’re going to do.
* **Grit** 
 – To win we need to want it. Every team member needs to be able to jump in and help at every turn. Whether it’s staying late to help a colleague or customer or finding a better process and making sure it’s communicated cross\\-functionally. You just have to do it and love it…and never stop trying.
* **Empathy** 
 – We need to care about each other, about our clients, about our business, and about the world around us. That might seem like a tall order, but if we don’t live in a constant state of empathy, if we don’t strive to truly put ourselves in another person’s shoes, we cannot truly serve the market.
