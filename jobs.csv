**About HP Wolf Security**
 The primary focus of the HP Wolf Security team is developing cyber security solutions to protect our customers devices and data. The digital threat landscape is ever\\-changing and as the cyber security industry reacts and adapts to changes, so too do the malware authors. Our unique micro\\-virtualization technology ensures that customers are protected from even the most bleeding edge cyber security threats. That micro\\-virtualization technology forms a key pillar in a wider cyber security suite that we're actively developing.
   

  

 To see what our engineering teams are working on, check out our technical blogs: https://threatresearch.ext.hp.com/blog
   

  

**Our History**
*Inspired by the isolation principles of traditional virtualization, our team known then as Bromium, created a game\\-changing technology called micro\\-virtualization to protect end users against advanced malware. Every task the user performs, such as opening a document or clicking on a link, is isolated in its own micro\\-VM, with access to just the resources required for that task, and existing just for the life of the task. Protection is thus provided through isolation, without relying on detection, hence reliably defending the user from polymorphic and even zero\\-day malware.*
*Bromium was acquired by HP Inc on 19 September 2019 forming HP Wolf Security.*

 5\\. Vendor Transition \\& Code Ownership
 



 • Lead knowledge transfer (KT) acceptance from external vendors
 



 • Take ownership of existing codebases without disruptive rewrites
 



 • Identify high\\-risk areas and stabilize incrementally
 



 • Set coding and operational standards for long\\-term maintainability
 



 6\\. Team Enablement (Not Line Management)
 



 • Mentor mid\\-level and junior engineers on: o Production debugging o Distributed systems thinking o Code quality under load
