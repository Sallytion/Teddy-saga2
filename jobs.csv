 We’re hiring an
 **AI Lead Engineer** 
 to architect, ship, and scale production\\-grade
 **Computer Vision** 
 with a focused
 **GenAI** 
 charter. You’ll lead 6–10 ML/CV engineers to deliver high\\-accuracy, low\\-latency video analytics—detection, tracking, segmentation, recognition, re\\-identification—tackling multi\\-camera tracking, 24/7 streaming at scale, long\\-tail drift, and edge optimization on GPUs/Jetson, while partnering with Product/Platform to meet FPS, latency, accuracy, and cost SLAs. The day\\-to\\-day centers on core CV model design, training/leval, deployment, and streaming/edge performance, complemented by GenAI that amplifies the stack: integrating VLM/LLM capabilities for natural\\-language video search, incident summarization, operator Q\\&A, and “copilot” workflows; standing up RAG over video/sensor/metadata embeddings with robust prompts, tooling, evals, and guardrails; and driving data ops with synthetic data, auto\\-labeling, active\\-learning triage with privacy, safety, and cost controls.
   

  

**What You’ll Own**
* End\\-to\\-end delivery of CV products: problem framing → data/labeling → model design → optimization → deployment → monitoring → iteration.
* Technical roadmap \\& architecture for video analytics pipelines (ingest → decode → infer → track → post\\-process → store/serve).
* Team leadership: mentoring, hiring input, OKRs, code/research standards, and performance coaching.


**Key Responsibilities**
**Technical Leadership \\& Execution**
* Translate business goals (e.g., “reduce shrinkage,” “increase throughput,” “improve safety”) into measurable CV objectives and SLAs/SLOs (e.g., mAP/IDF1, per\\-frame latency, dropped\\-frame rate, cost/stream).
* Lead design reviews; establish MLOps and coding standards; enforce experiment tracking, reproducibility, and dataset/version governance.
* Drive capacity planning, GPU/Jetson utilization, batching/windowing strategy, autoscaling, and cost governance.


**Computer Vision R\\&D (Detection, Tracking, Segmentation, Recognition)**
* Deliver production models for object detection/segmentation/classification/tracking (e.g., YOLOv8/v9, Mask R\\-CNN/Mask2Former, EfficientNet/ConvNeXt, ByteTrack/OC\\-SORT/DeepSORT).
* Build person/vehicle/product re\\-ID, face/attribute recognition (e.g., ArcFace/CosFace), OCR (e.g., PP\\-OCR), and keypoint/action recognition (e.g., MMPose, SlowFast/X3D).
* Tackle domain adaptation, class imbalance, and occlusions; design augmentations and semi\\-supervised/active learning loops to harvest hard negatives.


**Video Analytics \\& Edge Inference**
* Architect real\\-time pipelines using NVIDIA DeepStream/GStreamer/OpenCV; optimize decode (NVDEC), pre/post, and trackers for 30–60 FPS at 1080p.
* Optimize with TensorRT/ONNX Runtime/Torch\\-TensorRT, INT8 calibration, pruning/distillation; leverage Jetson Orin/Xavier/Nano and DLA where applicable.
* Design multi\\-camera fusion, homography/camera calibration, and cross\\-camera ID consistency for retail, traffic, manufacturing, and security use cases.
* Implement privacy\\-by\\-design features (e.g., face/license blur, PII redaction).


**Generative AI \\& LLMs**
* Architect robust RAG: retrieval pipelines with Pinecone/ChromaDB/Milvus; index sharding/compaction; freshness policies; hybrid search.
* Design agents with LangChain/LangGraph; implement tool\\-use, safety filters, and guardrails; add evaluation loops (e.g., RAGAS/DeepEval\\-style).


**Platform, Serving \\& MLOps**
* Ship services via FastAPI/Flask; containerize with Docker; orchestrate on Kubernetes (KServe) or AWS SageMaker/Vertex AI.
* Build high\\-throughput inference with Triton Inference Server (dynamic batching, concurrent models, model ensembles).
* Streaming \\& storage: RTSP/RTMP ingest, Kafka/Kinesis, object storage \\+ time\\-series DB; index/frame\\-level metadata for search and analytics.
* CI/CD with MLflow/DVC (artifacts, model registry), unit/integration tests, and rollout strategies (canary, shadow).


**Observability, Drift \\& Governance**
* Production monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana; per\\-stage latency, FPS, GPU memory/SM occupancy, dropped frames, and backpressure.
* Model observability: data/feature drift, concept drift on detections/tracks, re\\-ID distribution shifts, outlier/novelty detection, safety metrics.
* Human\\-in\\-the\\-loop review tools (CVAT/Label Studio) and auto\\-retraining triggers; maintain model cards, evaluation reports, versioned prompts/configs, and auditability.
* Ensure compliance and privacy/PII handling; ONVIF/edge security best practices.


**Cross\\-Functional \\& People Leadership**
* Partner with Product/SRE/DevOps on roadmaps, SLAs, incident response runbooks, and cost/perf tradeoffs.
* Lead and grow a 6–10 person CV team; foster a culture of high\\-quality experiments, rigorous reviews, and measurable impact.
* Communicate progress/risks to executives with clear, metric\\-driven updates and customer\\-facing results.


**Required Qualifications**
* Candidate shall have a degree in B.E/B.Tech/MCA in any discipline preferable computer science
* 5–8 years in ML/Computer Vision with 2\\+ years leading 6–10 engineers delivering production video analytics.
* Proven track record shipping detection/tracking/segmentation/recognition systems with business impact (accuracy, latency, cost).
