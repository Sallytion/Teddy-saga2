"li-4360804152","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4360804152","","Mechanical Engineer - Solutions","CynLr","Bengaluru, Karnataka, India","","fulltime","","","","","",False,"entry level","Engineering","","","**About CynLr** 




 Just like a baby’s brain, CynLr Visual Intelligence stack makes Robots to instinctively see \\& pick any object under any ambience, without any training. (a demo video link).
 



 Today, a robot that can fit a screw into a nut without slipping a thread, doesn’t exist. Imagine what it would take for a robot to assemble a Smartphone or a car by putting together 1000s of parts with varied shapes and weights, all in random orientations. Thus, factories become complex, needing heavy customization of their environment.
 



 CynLr\\-enabled visual robots
 *intuitively learn to handle even unknown objects, on\\-the\\-fly,* 
 eliminating the need for rigid fixtures, pre\\-training, or environment customization. This enables an universal alternative to custom automation thus simplifying factory lines into
 *modular LEGO\\-like micro\\-factories* 
 that can be rapidly reconfigured as products change.
 



 At the core of CynLr lies a fundamentally new approach to machine vision. Unlike conventional vision systems that rely on image recognition and heuristics, CynLr’ s Vision and ML stacks are
 *deeply inspired by neuroscience,* 
 modelling how biological vision understands shape, geometry, and interaction rather than appearance alone. To support this, CynLr builds its hardware, sensors, compute pipelines, and learning stacks from scratch, tightly coupling perception, decision\\-making, and action.
 



 This integration allows CynLr to operate in conditions that defeat traditional automation: variable lighting, cluttered environments, unknown objects, and high precision manipulation, unlocking automation use cases that have remained unsolved for decades. By rethinking vision as an intelligent, adaptive sense rather than a static tool, CynLr is redefining how robots perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world.
 



  





**About the Role** 




 This role focuses on
 **applying CynLr’s products to real\\-world customer and internal R\\&D use cases** 
 .
 



 You will work at the intersection of
 **product capability and customer reality** 
 , translating application needs, constraints, and workflows into
 **complete mechanical solutions** 
 . The work begins with a
 **deep understanding of customer problems** 
 , rather than jumping straight to parts or prototypes, and evolves into system\\-level designs that guide
 **integration, deployment, and iteration** 
 .
 



 Strong engineering here lives in the balance between
 **theory, system understanding, and hands\\-on reality** 
 . You will use first\\-principles thinking to frame application problems, identify constraints, and design
 **practical, testable solutions** 
 that work reliably in real customer environments.
 



 You will own the
 **entire solution lifecycle** 
 , from application definition and system architecture to mechanical design, integration, testing, and on\\-site refinement. The goal is not one\\-off demos, but
 **repeatable, deployable solutions** 
 that feed back into scalable and configurable product offerings.
 



 This role suits engineers who enjoy
 **system\\-level thinking** 
 , working
 **close to customers and hardware** 
 , and seeing solutions through to real\\-world deployment.
 



  





**What You Will Do** 



* Design
 **customer\\-facing applications and solutions** 
 , including:
* Visualising and modelling
 **product integration into real factory environments, machines, and workflows**
* Translating
 **abstract customer requirements and constraints** 
 into complete mechanical system architectures
* Designing
 **end\\-to\\-end mechanical solutions** 
 that account for installation, operation, and long\\-term use
* Support
 **integrator\\-driven deployment** 
 through:
* Mechanically customizable interfaces and mounting strategies
* Clear physical APIs, tolerances, and integration logic for repeatable field deployment
* On\\-site or near\\-field iteration, troubleshooting, and refinement
* Evolve solutions from:
* Custom, integrator\\-heavy deployments
* Configurable, teachable, and repeatable productized systems
* Collaborate closely with
 **product design, simulation, electronics, algorithms, manufacturing, and applications teams**
* Support validation, testing, and feedback from deployed systems



  





**What We Look For** 




 This role spans
 **end\\-to\\-end mechanical ownership of customer\\-facing solutions** 
 , without expecting universal expertise. We look for engineers with
 **deep, hands\\-on strength in designing and deploying real systems** 
 , supported by working knowledge across adjacent domains.
 



**Core Strengths** 



* Strong grounding in
 **mechanical fundamentals applied to real\\-world deployments**
* Deep expertise in one or more of:
* **Customer application and deployment engineering**
* **Special\\-purpose machine and station design**
* **Robotics application design and work cell integration**
* **End\\-of\\-arm tooling and gripper customisation**
* **Robotic system simulation for reach, cycle time, and risk**
* **Designing systems under installation, service, and uptime constraints**



**Mindset** 



* Hands\\-on experience with
 **factory, lab, or customer deployments**
* Ability to think in
 **workflows, use cases, and failure modes**
* Comfort with
 **incomplete requirements and evolving customer needs**
* Strong bias toward
 **documentation, validation, and repeatability**
* Ability to translate
 **application logic, algorithms, or control behaviour** 
 into mechanical architectures



**Tools** 



* Proficiency with
 **CAD drafting and 3D modelling tools** 
 (Fusion 360 preferred)
* Working familiarity with
 **robotics simulation and validation workflows**
* Exposure to
 **robot arms, grippers, sensors, motion components, wiring, and integration hardware**
* Experience with
 **scripting or automation tools** 
 is a plus



*Specific tools are not the primary filter. Sound engineering judgment and first\\-principles thinking matter more.* 




  





**Team Structure \\& Growth** 




 You will be part of a
 **multi\\-specialised mechanical team** 
 , working alongside
 **design engineers, simulation engineers, and general mechanical engineers** 
 .
 



 The role is
 **highly cross\\-functional** 
 , with close collaboration across
 **electronics, algorithms, software, manufacturing, and applications teams** 
 . Even as a solutions\\-focused engineer, your work remains tightly connected to
 **product design and long\\-term evolution** 
 .
 



 As CynLr grows, you will have opportunities to
 **own larger solution spaces** 
 , build deployment playbooks, mentor teams, or expand into
 **product architecture, operations, or customer applications leadership** 
 .
 



  





**Why This Role Matters** 




 Object manipulation has remained unsolved because
 **real\\-world applications refuse to behave like clean lab problems** 
 . This role exists to bridge that gap.
 



 Your work will turn cutting\\-edge capability into
 **systems that actually work on factory floors** 
 , and in the process, redefine what
 **mechanical solutions engineering** 
 means in robotics.
