* Develop Core Communication Services: Build and maintain backend services for voice/video calling (signaling servers, call routing logic, media gateways) using SIP and WebRTC. Implement features like call setup, conferencing, transfers, and recording with a focus on efficiency and reliability.
* Enhance Audio Quality (DSP): Implement and tune digital signal processing algorithms for superior call audio. This includes noise suppression, echo cancellation, jitter buffer optimization, and voice activity detection to ensure crystal\\-clear, uninterrupted communication even on poor networks.
* Optimize Media \\& Codecs: Work with real\\-time media streaming (RTP) and various codecs (Opus, G.711, H.264, etc.). Optimize codec configurations and adapt bitrates on the fly based on network conditions to balance quality and bandwidth.
* Integrate Voice AI Features: Embed speech\\-to\\-text (ASR) and text\\-to\\-speech (TTS) capabilities into the platform. Enable AI voice agents to participate in calls by streaming audio to AI services and injecting synthesized speech responses. Manage conversation flow between humans and AI (handling interruptions, timing responses) to make interactions feel natural.
* Ensure Scalability \\& Resilience: Design services with a cloud\\-native approach (microservices, containers) for deployment on Kubernetes. Implement high\\-availability strategies (clustering, failover) across global data centers so that the platform achieves five\\-9s uptime with no downtime for maintenance.
* Performance \\& Reliability Tuning: Continuously profile and improve system performance end\\-to\\-end. Minimize call setup times and audio latency through efficient coding (C/C\\+\\+ for media processing) and system optimizations.
* DevOps \\& Support: Use CI/CD pipelines to deploy updates safely with zero downtime. Write comprehensive automated tests (unit, integration, load) for your features. Participate in on\\-call rotation to troubleshoot and resolve production issues in real time, and implement lasting solutions to prevent recurrence.
* Collaboration: Work closely with Product Managers, front\\-end teams, AI/ML team and with network engineers.


**Qualifications**
* Real\\-Time Communications: 5\\+ years of experience developing VoIP or real\\-time communication systems. Strong knowledge of SIP protocol, WebRTC, and related networking (RTP, NAT traversal). Proven ability to implement call logic and troubleshoot signaling and media issues.
* Audio/DSP Expertise: Hands\\-on experience with audio processing in real time. Familiarity with noise reduction, echo cancellation, jitter buffers, and other voice QoS techniques. Comfort optimizing or using audio codecs (Opus, G.711, etc.) and improving call quality under varying network conditions.
* Strong Coding Skills: Proficiency in C/C\\+\\+ for high\\-performance, multi\\-threaded systems programming. Experience writing efficient, low\\-latency code (lock\\-free structures, memory management). Additionally, skilled with a higher\\-level language like Go or Java for building microservices and control logic.
* Cloud \\& Scalability: Experience building and deploying services in a cloud\\-native environment (Docker, Kubernetes). Knowledge of designing scalable microservices and using cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Azure) for load balancing, monitoring, and fault tolerance.
* Voice AI Familiarity: Exposure to integrating speech recognition and text\\-to\\-speech in applications. You’ve perhaps worked with voice assistants, IVR systems, or call center AI – you understand basic latency/accuracy trade\\-offs and how to interface with speech APIs/SDKs.
* Security \\& Compliance: Basic understanding of securing voice communications (TLS, SRTP) and safeguarding customer data (GDPR, HIPAA considerations for call recordings, etc.). Designs solutions with privacy and security best practices in mind.
* DevOps Mindset: Comfortable using CI/CD, infrastructure\\-as\\-code, and logging/monitoring tools. Willing to take ownership of code in production – debugging live issues, optimizing resource usage, and responding to incidents.
* Team Player: Excellent collaboration and communication skills. Experience working in Agile teams. Ability to clearly document designs and mentor others. A proactive attitude to problem\\-solving and an enthusiasm for continuous learning in the fast\\-evolving communications and AI field.
