**Job Description**
 Are you a technology generalist who sees chaos as a challenge and complexity as a puzzle waiting to be solved? Do you believe that true engineering excellence is about sorting things out from the root, regardless of the technology stack?
   

  

 We are searching for a rare talent—a hard\\-core techie who thrives on end\\-to\\-end ownership. This isn't a role where you're just a ""front\\-end person"" or a ""backend person."" We are building a team of problem\\-solvers who can navigate the entire technical landscape, from the user's browser to the deepest layers of our infrastructure. You will be a hands\\-on contributor, a strategic thinker, and a leader who can turn an ambiguous problem into a systematic, scalable, and easy\\-to\\-consume solution.
   

  

 What You'll Do
   

  

* Architect and Build End\\-to\\-End Solutions: Take complete ownership of features, from ideation and design to development, deployment, and monitoring.
* Deconstruct and Simplify: Dive into complex, messy systems, identify the root\\-causes of issues, and build elegant, long\\-term solutions that make our technology easier to understand and maintain.
* Embrace Any Challenge: Whether it's optimizing a database query, building a performant UI, or configuring a CI/CD pipeline, you are eager to jump in wherever the problem exists. No task is too small or too large; it's all about solving the problem.
* Drive Technical Excellence: Be a champion for best practices in code quality, system design, and performance, helping the team level up with every new project.
* Automate for Efficiency: You are creatively ""lazy"" in the best possible way. If a problem repeats, you're not just fixing it—you're building a tool or process to ensure it never needs to be fixed again.
* Mentor and Lead: Guide and inspire your peers with your technical expertise and systematic approach to problem\\-solving.


 Why This Role is Different
   

  

 We don't care about the number of years on your resume or your specific list of certifications. We care about your ability to solve problems and your desire to own the entire solution. This role offers a high degree of autonomy and the chance to have a massive impact, directly influencing our product and technology strategy from day one. If you're tired of working in a silo and want to be a true generalist, this is your opportunity.
   

  

**Requirements**
 What You Bring
   

  

* A ""Problem\\-First"" Mindset: A track record of solving fundamental problems, not just implementing features. You are a curious and relentless tinkerer who loves to figure out how things work.
* Full\\-Stack Fluency: While you don't need to be a master of every single technology, you must be proficient enough to operate across the entire stack—front\\-end, back\\-end, databases, and infrastructure. We would on Java, Springboot, React JS, Postgres, MySQL and AWS cloud platform.
* Technology Agnosticism: You understand that a programming language is just a tool. You can quickly learn new stacks and apply the right one to the problem at hand.
* Experience with Chaos: You've been in the trenches and have experience transforming legacy, fragile systems into robust, reliable ones. A background of at least two years in a startup or similar fast\\-paced environment is a big plus.
* Strong Communication: You have the ability to clearly articulate complex technical concepts to both technical and non\\-technical audiences.
* A Passion for Simplicity: You are obsessed with creating solutions that are not only powerful but also intuitive and maintainable for both developers and end\\-users.


**Benefits**
 What We Offer:
   

  

* Impactful Product: At Synoriq, you get to work on exciting products and software that create a huge impact in the lives of common people. You get exposure to the financial sector. With projects of such scale, we work on the latest technologies in the market.
* Great Nucleus of Minds: You get to work with the smartest people and learn together. Our team is a bunch of talented designers, engineers, singers, storytellers, and dancers.
* Fun: We understand that there is a life outside the office too. We offer flexibility in your work schedule and work from home so that you give your best every day.
* Leadership Initiatives: We promote the overall development of an individual and help you realize your professional goals. There are ample learning opportunities providing exposure to different domains and to work in cutting\\-edge technology.
