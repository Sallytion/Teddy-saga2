 Software Development Engineer in Test
   

  

 Career as Software Development Engineer in Test \\- Overview
   

  

 An SDET, otherwise referred to as a software development engineer in test, takes part equally in software development and testing processes. The SDET mainly works within the IT, gaming, advertising, entertainment, financial, or hospitality sectors and focuses on software development’s testability, robustness, and performance.
   

  

 Here, we’ll look at what the work entails, as well as the skills and qualifications required. We will also look at the salary structure as well as the best colleges and courses to pursue a career as an SDET.
   

  

 What are the roles \\& responsibilities of a Software Development Engineer in Test ?
   

  

* Understanding the flow of code and the way it interacts with different components.
* Understanding project documents, customer demands, and merchandise objectives to make and execute test cases.
* Organizing, maintaining, and performing test automation frameworks on multiple application platforms, like Mobile, Desktop, and Web, and building test scenarios and acceptance tests.
* Investigate customer problems mentioned to you by the technical support team, test bugs, and create and manage bug reports.
* Handling technical communications and understanding the customers’ systems.
* Working with deployments teams, resolving level issues for systems, coordinating on product design, and offering inputs on the testability of functional elements and merchandise designs.
* Noting all testing actions you’ve got performed in daily and weekly reports.
* Analyzing and disintegrating software systems and coordinating with other teams to reinforce the general design.
* Researching test tools, methodologies, and trends and upgrading existing practices and processes.
* Managing the ultimate quality on production release.

 After Career Profiles
   

  

 How to become an SDET in India?
   

  

 Step 1: Obtain Required Qualifications
   

  

 To pursue a career in Software development engineer in test (SDET), the minimum education qualification requires a bachelor’s degree in B.tech, computer science, computer engineering or similar fields. High\\-level SDET might require additional qualifications like a Master’s degree in computer science
   

  

 Step 2: Enhance Development and Testing Skills
   

  

 Many aspiring SDETs feel that learning to use popular APIs for test automation is all they need to succeed. In order to be genuinely effective, more software development talents are required.
   

  

 SDETs who are well\\-versed in programming logic and principles tend to be better. Object\\-oriented programming, decision structures, repetition structures, and data structures have been employed in all mature automation projects I’ve been involved in.
   

  

 While SDETs must be strong programmers, the most effective SDETs are strong testers as well. It becomes worthless if the most beautifully written test automation code does not adequately validate the expected behaviour.
   

  

 Clean coding practices and the adoption of design patterns are essential for long\\-term maintenance, reusability, and extensibility.
   

  

 Step 3: Earn SDET Certifications
   

  

 To own certification for a skill is like a cherry on the cake. Get the top SDET certifications to validate your skillset and get a high paying job for the hard work you have put in.

 Data Engineer
   

  

 Career as a Data Engineer \\- Overview
   

  

 Data Engineers are liable for identifying trends in data sets and building algorithms to increase the value of data to the organisation. This IT position necessitates a wide range of technical skills, including in\\-depth knowledge of SQL database design and several programming languages. However, they must be able to communicate across departments to understand what business leaders want to achieve with the company’s enormous datasets.
   

  

 Data Engineers are frequently responsible for developing algorithms that allow more access to data, but to do so, they must understand the client’s or company’s objectives. It is critical to keep business goals in mind when working with data, especially for firms that deal with vast and complex datasets and databases.
   

  

 Python, Java, R, and C\\+\\+ are some of the major coding languages used by Data Engineers.
   

  

 Here, we’ll look at what the work entails, as well as the skills and qualifications required. We will also look at the salary structure as well as the best colleges and courses to pursue a career in data engineering.

* 🚀 ECS Fargate, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions


**How We Expect You To Work 👷‍♀️**
* We expect you to work in these ways, as well as encouraging and enabling these practices from others:
* Collaborate 💬 \\- We work in cross\\-functional, mission driven, autonomous squads that gel over time. We pair program to work better through shared experience and knowledge.
* Focus on outcomes over outputs ✅ \\- Solving a problem for users that translates to business results is our goal. Measurements focused on that goal help us to understand if we are succeeding.
* Practice continuous improvement 💡 \\- We optimise for feedback now, rather than presume what might be needed in the future and introduce complexity before it will be used. This means we learn faster. We share learnings in blame\\-free formats, so that we do not repeat things that have failed, but still have confidence to innovate.
* Seek to understand our users 👂 \\- We constantly seek understanding from data and conversations to better serve our users' needs, taking an active part in research to hear from them directly and regularly.
* Embrace and enable continuous deployment 🤖 \\- Seamless delivery of changes into an environment \\- without manual intervention \\- is essential for us to ensure that we are highly productive; consider resiliency; and practice security by design.
* Test outside\\-in, test first 🚦 \\- TDD keeps us confident in moving fast, and deploying regularly. We want to solve user problems, and so we test with that mindset \\- writing scenarios first, then considering our solution; coupling tests to behaviour, rather than implementation.
* You build it, you run it ⚙️ \\- We embrace DevOps culture and end\\-to\\-end ownership of products and features. Every engineer, regardless of their role, has the opportunity to lead delivery of features from start to finish.
* Be cloud native ☁️ \\- We leverage automation and hosted services to deliver resilient, secure services quickly and consistently. Where SaaS tools help us achieve more productivity and better\\-quality results for a cheap price, we use these to automate low value tasks.


**How We Expect You To Behave ❤️**
* We embrace differences and know that when we can be ourselves at work, we are happier, more motivated, and creative. We want to be able to bring our whole selves to work, have our own perspectives and know that we belong. As such, through your behaviours at work, we expect you to reflect and actively sustain a healthy engineering environment that looks like this:
* A wide range of voices heard to the benefit of all
* Teams that are clearly happy, engaged, and laugh together
* Perceivable safety to have an opinion or ask a question
* No egos \\- people listen to and learn from others at all levels, with strong opinions held loosely


**Benefits \\& Perks 😍**
* Equity. We want people to have a stake in the business so that all our interests are aligned.
* Health Insurance for employee and dependents.
* Wellbeing and social events
* Support causes that matter to you – Volunteering time off

***Our story***
 OakNorth Bank was built on the foundations of frustrations with old\\-school banking. In 2005, when our founders tried to get capital for their data analytics company, the computer said ‘no’. Unfortunately, all major banks in the UK were using the same computer – and it was broken.
   

  

 Why was it so difficult for a profitable business with impressive cashflow, retained clients, and clear commercial success to get a loan?
   

  

 The industry was backward\\-looking and too focused on historic financials, rather than future potential.
   

  

 So, what if there was a bank, founded by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs? One that offered a dramatically better borrowing experience for businesses?
   

  

 No more what ifs, OakNorth Bank exists.
