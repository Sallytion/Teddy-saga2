* Implement high\\-performance GPU/TPU clusters to support distributed training and large\\-scale inference.
* Ensure business continuity through backup, disaster recovery, and multi\\-region deployments.


 Automation \\& Reliability
   

  

* Develop and maintain Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates with Terraform, or Cloud Deployment Manager.
* Adopt GitOps practices (Flux) for infrastructure lifecycle management.
* Build and optimize CI/CD pipelines for data pipelines, model workflows, and GenAI applications.

 Security, Governance \\& Compliance
   

  

* Embed DevSecOps best practices across the infrastructure lifecycle, including policy\\-as\\-code, vulnerability scanning, and secrets management.
* Enforce identity and access management (IAM), network segmentation, and data encryption in compliance with standards (HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, FedRAMP).
* Collaborate with enterprise security and compliance teams to implement governance frameworks for GenAI platforms.


 Monitoring, Observability \\& Cost Optimization
   

  

* Implement observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, Cloud Monitoring, Datadog) for both infra health and ML\\-specific metrics (model drift, data anomalies).
* Define KPIs to monitor system health, performance, and adoption across AI workloads.
* Optimize cloud cost efficiency for GPU/TPU\\-intensive workloads using autoscaling, preemptible instances, and utilization monitoring.


 Collaboration \\& Enablement
   

  

* Partner with data scientists, ML engineers, and software teams to streamline GenAI application development and deployment.
* Provide onboarding, documentation, and reusable templates to enable faster adoption of AI infrastructure.
* Stay current with the latest advancements in GenAI, cloud\\-native infrastructure, and container orchestration.
