**About The Team**
 Document Persistent Storage Service provides secure, resilient, and highly scalable persistence with simple, easy\\-to\\-use APIs. We build, expand and extend outstanding database, key\\-value and object storage applications to store and orchestrate documents in a SaaS cloud environment. Our team's ownership is focused primarily on private data centers services but with an eye on growing the public cloud ownership also.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Join our dynamic team as a DevOps Engineer and play a crucial role in building and operating resilient and scalable infrastructure using ground breaking technologies like Chef, Ansible and Public cloud. This is a great opportunity to chip into critical applications where high availability and scalability are paramount. If you are passionate about testing, distributed database systems, concurrency, distributed storage, availability and system design, we encourage you to apply.
   

  

**About You**
 You possess a expertise in deploying and operating databases or distributed systems, ideally using tools such as Chef or Ansible. You like to mentor junior developers in team and a strong team player.
   

  

**What You'll Do:**
* Build and maintain highly available and scalable infrastructure to support critical applications.
* Contribute to the development and operation of restful services, service oriented architectures, distributed systems, cloud systems, and microservices on Linux operating systems or equivalent.
* Apply your experience with configuration management tools (Chef, Ansible, or Puppet), containerisation (Docker) to deploy and manage applications.
* Collaborate effectively within a team to achieve common goals, demonstrating strong communication skills and attention to detail.
* Participate in the design, maintenance, and improvement of highly available and fault\\-tolerant distributed software systems.
* Contribute to and promote a strong testing culture, including unit, system, and integration testing, feature toggles, canary deployments, and gradual rollouts.
* Engage with logging, monitoring, metrics, and statistics technologies to ensure system health and performance.
* Participate in an on\\-call rotation to provide support and triage for production services after a training period.


**Basic Qualifications:**
* Bachelor's degree or higher in a computer\\-related field.
* Proficient to Linux operating systems and concepts, including memory and storage management, threading and concurrency, networking and sockets, and process management.
* Expert in at least one scripting language such as Python, Ruby or Bash.


**Other Qualifications (Desirable):**
* Strong collaboration skills and the ability to work effectively with teammates.
* Expert in areas related to performance and scale, security, availability, deployment, and operations.
* A strong understanding of testing methodologies and quality assurance practices.

**Our Approach to Flexible Work**
 With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in\\-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in\\-office each week, we simply
 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
