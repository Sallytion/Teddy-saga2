 Our backend systems handle millions of orders per day from across India, reaching about 5% of all Indian households, all with near\\-zero downtime to date. Achieving this level of reliability and performance in a hyper\\-growth environment is a testament to our engineering excellence.
   

  

**Marketplace Reach** 
 : Over 1\\.75 million sellers are registered on Meesho’s platform, supported by our state\\-of\\-the\\-art tech infrastructure and pan\\-India logistics network. This wide reach — covering virtually every serviceable pin code in the country — presents unique engineering challenges in areas like search, personalization, and payments at scale.
   

  

**Scalable Architecture:** 
 We continually innovate our architecture for growth.. Our quest to serve a billion Indian users has helped us evolve our technologies from a monolith to microservices to now a high scale federated architecture. This evolution allows us to build and deploy features rapidly while maintaining stability for a fast\\-growing user base.
   

  

**Cutting\\-edge Tech Stack:** 
 Our platform is built using modern, open\\-source technologies on the cloud while ensuring high efficiency. We strategically choose proven tools (for example, Java and Golang for services, Kafka for messaging, Dragonfly and Redis for caching, ScyllaDB, MySQL and Mongo for Data) and leverage GCP infrastructure to ensure high performance, reliability, and flexibility. By focusing on the right tools for the right problems, we innovate pragmatically rather than chasing every new tech hype, which helps us solve real\\-world problems effectively.

**Lightspeed:** 
 We prioritize rapid iteration and delivery. Engineers are encouraged to ship fast and refine continuously, as we value in order to learn and adapt quickly.
   

  

**Continuous Improvement** 
 : We view failures and bugs as opportunities to improve. A blameless post\\-mortem culture ensures that mistakes become lessons, fostering an environment where learning from failure drives resilience and innovation.
   

  

**Ownership Mindset:** 
 Every engineer is empowered to act like an owner. We instill a “Founder’s Mindset,” encouraging engineers to take end\\-to\\-end ownership of projects and drive them with an entrepreneurial spirit. This means our teams proactively identify problems and champion solutions, just as a founder would for their own product.
   

  

 Engineering at Meesho is more than just writing code – it's about solving complex, impactful problems at an unprecedented scale. Our engineers tackle challenging use cases (from enabling real\\-time logistics across India to optimizing a vast product catalog for the next billion users), making a tangible impact on millions of entrepreneurs and customers.
