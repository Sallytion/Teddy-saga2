 With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in\\-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work.

 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together.

 Evaluate outputs for hallucinations, factual accuracy (specifically for patent law), and consistency using tools like OpenAI/Ollama.
* **Fine\\-Tuning Pipelines:** 
 Validate datasets and monitor training runs to benchmark model performance.



**3\\. Quality Ownership \\& Engineering** 



* **Code Review:** 
 Review frontend and backend code from a testability perspective, identifying anti\\-patterns and suggesting better error handling.
* **Test Design:** 
 Write scalable, reusable test cases for complex multi\\-user workflows.

 Expert at testing APIs (Postman, curl) and understanding
 **Node.js/Python** 
 logic.
* **AI Knowledge:** 
 Hands\\-on experience with:
* **LLMs:** 
 OpenAI API, Ollama, or local model orchestration.
* **Vector Tech:** 
 RAG pipelines and vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.).
* **Prompt Engineering:** 
 Ability to identify issues with prompts and agentic logic.
* **Testing Mindset:** 
 Proven ability to test for concurrency, race conditions, and system\\-level failures.
* **Tools:** 
 Proficiency in Jira/TestRail and exposure to automation frameworks like
 **Playwright, Cypress, or PyTest.**
* **JIRA \\+ Confluence exposure must.**



  





**Nice\\-to\\-Have Skills**

 **Intellectual Property (IP) / Patent domain.**
* Experience with
 **Docker, CI/CD pipelines,** 
 and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP).
* Experience with
 **LLM evaluation frameworks** 
 (e.g., RAGAS, DeepEval).
* Performance/Load testing exposure using tools like k6 or Locust.



  





**What We Expect From You** 



* **You are a System Breaker:** 
 You don't just test features; you look for ways the system might fail under stress.
* **You Think Like a Developer:** 
 You can read code to understand where the bugs are likely hiding.
* **You are a Quality Advocate:** 
 You are comfortable challenging implementations when quality or user experience is at risk.
* **You are AI\\-Curious:** 
 You stay updated on the latest in LLMs and agentic frameworks.



  





**What We Offer** 



* Opportunity to work at the intersection of
 **Generative AI** 
 and
 **LegalTech.**
* A highly technical environment where QA is treated as an engineering discipline.
* Freedom to explore and implement new testing methodologies for AI.","IT Services and IT Consulting, IT System Testing and Evaluation, and IT System Data Services","https://in.linkedin.com/company/meril","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQHdsSopU_HYFw/company-logo_100_100/B4DZn2FzI9HsAQ-/0/1760770343571/meril_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Ylwcf2aozsk0MoH-UBD1myyk8wm3X5G2EzwnjRmWjeM","","","","","","","","","","",""
