* You think in systems—reliability, observability, failure modes, edge cases
* You''''''''re obsessed with evaluation and know that vibes\\-based testing doesn''''''''t scale
* You understand that enterprise means auditability, compliance, and zero surprises
* You ship fast and iterate based on real\\-world feedback

* Hands\\-on experience designing multi\\-agent systems with clear task decomposition and coordination
