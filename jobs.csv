*Where creative engineering meets applied AI* 




 At JuiceLabs, we’re building vertical AI\\-native tools that unlock fresh insights and creative superpowers for our clients in advertising, ecommerce, and beyond. We're a nimble team of founders and builders obsessed with using AI to solve real\\-world problems in novel ways.
 



  





**The Opportunity** 




*This isn’t your run\\-of\\-the\\-mill backend gig.* 




  





 As a Backend Python Developer at JuiceLabs, you’ll do much more than write APIs—you’ll help shape new products from zero to one, often with AI at the core. You’ll work directly with our Cofounder/CTO and be trusted with real ownership: building scalable systems, exploring new AI tools, and rapidly prototyping ideas that can turn into breakthrough features.
 



  





 We
 
 looking for
 
 engineers who can reason about algorithmic complexity, optimize data\\-intensive pipelines, and make smart trade\\-offs when performance and scale are on the line. If you ship fast, love clean architecture, get excited about building with LLMs, and can spot when an O(n²) solution is about to become a production nightmare—this role was made for you.
 



  





**What You’ll Do** 




**Build Core Infrastructure** 
 : Design reliable backend systems in Python (FastAPI, GCP/AWS, Postgres). Architect data pipelines that process large volumes efficiently, choose optimal data structures for caching and indexing, and write algorithms that scale gracefully.
 



**Own What You Ship** 
 : Take projects end\\-to\\-end—from ideation and design to deployment, monitoring, and iteration.
 



**Work Closely with Leadership** 
 : Partner with the CTO to co\\-create product experiences that fuse backend muscle with AI magic.
 



**Bring Ideas to Life** 
 : Help turn wild ideas into working prototypes, and prototypes into production. You’re not just building what's asked—you’re helping invent what comes next.
 



**Work with AI** 
 : Use GenAI APIs and frameworks to prototype and build powerful features—from pipelines to agentic workflows, from image/video generation to agents.
 



  





**What We’re Looking For** 




**Strong in Data Structures and Algorithms** 

 :
 
 You know when to reach for a hash map vs. a heap, understand Big\\-O, and can debug performance bottlenecks in real systems. You apply DSA principles to solve actual problems—optimizing data pipelines, choosing efficient data structures for scale, and reasoning about complexity trade\\-offs. LeetCode ninja not required, but you should be able to explain why your code won't blow up at 10x scale.
 



**Python Expertise** 
 : Clean, idiomatic Python. Backend frameworks, testing, deployment pipelines.
 



**Production\\-Ready Mindset** 
 : Deployed real systems. Profile code, optimize queries, implement caching strategies. Docker, CI/CD, cloud infra—you get things live and keep them running efficiently.
 



**High Ownership** 
 : You take initiative, follow through, and don’t wait to be told what to do. You're comfortable with autonomy and accountability.
 



**Startup Energy** 
 : Build fast, wear multiple hats. Balance ""ship it now"" with ""will this scale?""
 



**AI Curiosity** 
 : You’ve dabbled with LLMs, tinkered with GenAI tools, or built side projects using open\\-source models or APIs. (Got a weird AI bot or internal GPT tool you built? Tell us!).
 



  





**Why JuiceLabs?** 




**Impact \\& Influence** 
 : Work shoulder\\-to\\-shoulder with founders. It will shape our products.
 



**Fast Growth, Real Problems** 
 : Tackle meaningful challenges in ecommerce, consumer insights, and creative tech.
 



**Culture of Ownership** 
 : We value builders, not order\\-takers. If you like agency and autonomy, you’ll thrive here.
 



**Creative Playground** 
 : Explore and build with the latest in AI. Try new ideas. Break things. Make new things.
 



  





**To Apply** 




 Apply on this job posting, and feel free to shoot your resume, GitHub, or links to any personal AI\\-backed projects you’ve built to join@juicelabs.ai—along with a few words on why JuiceLabs feels like the right playground for you.

**Role Overview:** 




**The Role:** 
 Lead Mobile Engineer \\- React Native (
 **Offline\\-First Architect** 
 )
 



**Experience:** 
 This role is the Technical Backbone of your mobile strategy. You are not looking for a ""UI
 



 Developer""; you are looking for a
 **Mobile Architect** 
 who understands the complex dance between a
 



 device's local database and the cloud, especially in a Healthcare/SaaS environment where doctors
 



 might be offline.
 



  





**Non\\-Negotiable Requirements (The ""Knock out Criteria"") :**

 short (e.g., for BLE integration or Background Tasks).
 



  





**3\\. Performance with Big Data:** 
 Proven experience rendering huge lists (10,000\\+ records) and
 



 managing memory without freezing the JS Thread.
 



  





**4\\. Team Leadership:** 
 Must have led a team of 3\\+ developers. You conduct Code Reviews,
 



 enforce Clean Architecture, and manage release cycles (CI/CD, Play Store/App Store).
 



  





**5\\. SaaS/Startup DNA:** 
 Experience in a high\\-growth SaaS product environment. You take
 



 ownership of the ""Go\\-Live"" and don't just wait for tickets.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities:** 




 •
 **Architectural Ownership:** 
 Design the ""Offline Sync Engine"" that keeps Doctor data available
 



 even without the internet.
 



 •
 **Team Leadership:** 
 Mentor junior devs, assign tasks, and ensure code quality via strict PR
 



 reviews.
 



 •
 **Complex Integrations:** 
 Handle Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for medical devices, Background
 



 Services, and Push Notifications.
 



**• DevOps:** 
 Automate build releases using Fastlane, Gradle, or Jenkins.
 



 •
 **Security:** 
 Implement SQLCipher to encrypt patient data locally on the device.
 



  





**Qualifications:** 




 • Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field.
 



 • 5\\-8 years of hands\\-on experience in React Native (Offline\\-First Architect)
 



 • Proven experience in a startup environment or product\\-based organization.
