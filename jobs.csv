We’re in this together, tackling big challenges with bold ideas and genuine care. We look for curious minds and courageous collaborators who bring sun\\-drenched optimism and drive. Whether you're building smarter solutions, supporting customers, or creating a space where everyone belongs, you’ll do meaningful work with Workmates who’ve got your back. In return, we’ll give you the trust to take risks, the tools to grow, the skills to develop and the support of a company invested in you for the long haul. So, if you want to inspire a brighter work day for everyone, including yourself, you’ve found a match in Workday, and we hope to be a match for you too.
   

  

**About The Team**
 Workday’s global opportunity is huge. Our Globalization Content team within our Growth organization is focused on building, maintaining and operating fully localized configuration, integrations, reports and Extend applications that meet our customer’s needs in global markets. By delivering a comprehensive catalog of content we enable the opportunity for Workday to serve our more customers effectively, winning more deals, reducing deployment cost and total cost of ownership. We deliver a clear return on investment for the business and help drive our global growth.
   

  

**About The Role**
 You will take on a senior engineer role in the team, with responsibility for designing and developing our solutions, integrations and configuration content. You will lead by example, demonstrating architecture and development best practices, while mentoring and empowering your fellow team members to achieve success. You are a problem solver and innovator who can work independently when not collaborating closely with team mates, PMs and architects.
   

  

 The role requires strong functional knowledge: You understand the ""why"" behind the data. You have experience with core business processes in either HCM (HR) or Financials. You are able to talk fluently with HR and Finance partners to understand their needs.
   

  

 Problem\\-Solving \\& Analytical Skills: We're not just hiring a ""coder."" You can analyze a business requirement, design a robust solution, and troubleshoot complex data flows.
   

  

 Communication \\& Collaboration: The role requires excellent communication skills. You must be skilled at gathering requirements from non\\-technical stakeholders and collaborating with stakeholders
   

  

**About You**
 Basic Qualifications
   

  

* 8\\+ years experience in software development engineering, architecting, building, and scaling robust and efficient software systems.

 With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in\\-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in\\-office each week, we simply
 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
   

  

 At Workday, we are committed to providing an accessible and inclusive hiring experience where all candidates can fully demonstrate their skills. If you require assistance or an accommodation at any point, please email accommodations@workday.com.
   

  

**Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!**
 At Workday, we value our candidates’ privacy and data security. Workday will never ask candidates to apply to jobs through websites that are not Workday Careers.
   

  

 Please be aware of sites that may ask for you to input your data in connection with a job posting that appears to be from Workday but is not.

 THE ROLE
   

  

 Join the AI Applications team within Production Engineering to bridge the gap between high\\-velocity AI experimentation and enterprise\\-grade stability. As an Software Engineer, you will own the ""Inner Loop"" of AI development, ensuring our LLM\\-based applications, RAG pipelines, and agentic workflows are built and deployed with world\\-class rigor. You won’t just manage infrastructure; you will architect the platform self\\-service capabilities and event\\-driven pipelines that allow Pure Storage to scale AI innovation at the speed of thought.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* Architect Platform Self\\-Service: Create internal APIs and Go\\-based abstractions that empower engineers to provision AI\\-ready environments—including model weights, vector DBs, and event streams—with a single command.
* Build Agentic Automation: Develop internal tools and AI Agents using Go and Python to automate root\\-cause analysis of infrastructure failures and proactively optimize system performance.
* Engineer Event\\-Driven AI Pipelines: Design and implement asynchronous processing pipelines using Kafka or RabbitMQ to manage high\\-volume data ingestion for RAG systems and real\\-time model demand.
* Ensure ""Golden Path"" Reproducibility: Standardize AI deployments using Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring that models, prompts, and code are perfectly synchronized across all environments.
* Optimize AI Observability: Implement advanced monitoring in Prometheus and Grafana to track AI\\-specific metrics, such as token latency and model drift, ensuring ""zero\\-downtime"" reliability under heavy inference loads.

**What You Can Expect From Us**
* Pure Innovation: We celebrate those who think critically, like a challenge and aspire to be trailblazers.
