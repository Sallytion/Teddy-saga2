 **AI\\-friendly classifications and metadata** 
 .



 3\\. Dataset Strategy \\& Design Intelligence
 


* Design and maintain
 **high\\-quality textile image datasets** 
 aligned with user needs and printing realities.
* Define dataset structure based on
 **design purpose** 
 , not just volume (e.g., commercial prints vs. fashion\\-forward designs).
* Continuously refine datasets based on
 **user feedback and output quality** 
 .



 4\\. AI Model Selection \\& Management (Decision\\-Oriented)
 


* Design and maintain a
 **Python\\-based AI management system** 
 that selects the most suitable AI model based on:
* User intent

 .
* Evaluate AI outputs against
 **user expectations and commercial usability** 
 , not just visual quality.
* Iterate models and prompts based on real feedback from designers or printing workflows.



 7\\. Cost Optimization \\& Practical AI Strategy
 


* Research and implement
 **cost\\-efficient AI generation strategies** 
 .
* Decide when:
* A large model is needed
* A smaller or fine\\-tuned model is sufficient
* Balance
 **quality vs. cost** 
 based on user requirements and business goals.



 8\\. Continuous Research \\& Technology Awareness
 


* Stay updated with
 **latest AI models, research papers, and tools** 
 relevant to generative design.
* Evaluate new technologies based on
 **practical usefulness** 
 , not hype.
* Work with the development team to implement promising AI advancements.



  





**Required Skills \\& Background** 




 Must\\-Have
 


* 1\\.5\\+ years of experience in
 **AI/ML, data science, or software development** 
 .
* Strong
