**About the Team: \\- Rippling PEO (Professional Employer Organization) and HR Services Overview** 




  





 Rippling’s
 **PEO (Professional Employer Organization)** 
 and
 **HR Services** 
 products help founders and small businesses build faster — and succeed with lower failure rates. Together, they drive over
 **$150M in annual revenue** 
 , forming a core pillar of Rippling’s business.
 



  





 In the early years, these systems were built at breakneck speed to enable go\\-to\\-market growth — fueling massive adoption but introducing tech debt and tightly coupled designs.
 



  





 Now in
 **Phase L2** 
 , the team is rebuilding the foundation into an
 **extensible, use\\-case–driven architecture** 
 — transforming complex, hard\\-coded systems into scalable, modular platforms. You’ll play a key role in re\\-imagining the backbone of Rippling’s HR ecosystem — improving developer velocity, reducing operational friction, and unlocking new market opportunities.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities**



* **System Reliability:**

 Significant reduction in workflow latency, data synchronization time, and operational overhead across distributed systems.
* **Developer Velocity:** 
 Modular, well\\-abstracted APIs and frameworks that empower internal teams to build on top of PEO systems without friction.
* **Business Impact:** 
 Faster onboarding for new countries and partners, reduced manual interventions, and measurable improvements in customer satisfaction and retention.



**Required Qualifications**



* **7\\-10 years** 
 of experience building large\\-scale, distributed systems in
 **high\\-compliance or high\\-integrity domains** 
 (HR, Payroll, FinTech, or Insurance).
* Deep expertise in
 **domain\\-driven design** 
 ,
 **data modeling** 
 , and
 **compliance\\-first architecture** 
 .
* Experience
 **scaling complex regulatory or multi\\-tenant systems** 
 , ideally spanning employment, benefits, or HR platforms.
* Proficiency in designing
 **extensible, modular service boundaries** 
 that maintain
 **auditability and backward compatibility** 
 .
* Strong understanding of
 **policy enforcement, rule engines, and event\\-driven systems** 
 .
* Ability to translate
 **legal and operational complexity** 
 into
 **elegant, maintainable engineering abstractions** 
 .
* A
 **hands\\-on architectural leader** 
 who can set technical direction, mentor teams, and drive large\\-scale transformations sustainably.



**Bonus Points**



* Experience with
 **compliance\\-as\\-code** 
 or
 **policy automation** 
 frameworks.
* Exposure to
 **global employment** 
 ,
 **EOR** 
 , or
 **multi\\-country workforce** 
 systems.
* Familiarity with
 **event sourcing** 
 ,
 **CQRS**
