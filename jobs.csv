* Have experience engineering scalable and reliable solutions in a cloud\\-native environment (the most important thing for us is understanding the fundamentals of CI/CD, practical Agile so to speak)
* Demonstrate a mindset of delivering secure, well\\-tested and well\\-documented software that integrates with various third party providers and partners (we do that a lot in the fintech industry)
