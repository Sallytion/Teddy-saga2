Each day brings new opportunities to innovate, experiment, and solve complex problems with adaptive, autonomous technologies.
   

  

 You’ll dive into the heart of our business—understanding objectives and translating them into agentic AI opportunities. Instead of just building models, you’ll design multi\\-agent systems that can plan, reason, and act in dynamic environments. By framing problems as hypotheses, you’ll explore data, knowledge bases, and APIs, uncovering patterns and insights that fuel the design of intelligent agents.
   

  

 In this role, you’ll go beyond traditional modeling. You’ll orchestrate the end\\-to\\-end process: business understanding, system design, and deployment of AI agents capable of handling real\\-world complexity. Leveraging advanced reasoning, RAG (retrieval\\-augmented generation), and agent orchestration, you’ll engineer solutions that autonomously adapt, learn, and optimize. You’ll evaluate these systems not just for accuracy, but for scalability, safety, and reliability in production.
   

  

 You won’t stop at building prototypes—you’ll integrate and operationalize agentic AI into applications, workflows, and processes, ensuring continuous value delivery. Your expertise extends beyond code: you’ll navigate business processes, identify opportunities for automation, and apply policies and standards to ensure our solutions are secure, private, accurate, and trustworthy.
   

  

 If you’re ready to embrace the power of
 **agentic AI** 
 to transform how enterprises operate, then join us at Kyndryl. Together, we’ll redefine what’s possible and unlock the next generation of intelligent, autonomous systems.

 **customer\\-obsessed** 
 , designing solutions that deliver real business impact, and you’re
 **collaborative and inclusive** 
 , working seamlessly across teams, disciplines, and technologies to build systems that truly make a difference.
   

  

**Required Skills And Experience**
* 6\\+ Yrs Hands\\-on experience building and deploying agentic AI systems, autonomous workflows, or multi\\-agent orchestration solutions.
* Proficiency in AI/ML development tools and languages such as Python, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Hugging Face, or orchestration frameworks like Azure AI Studio, Prompt Flow, AutoGen, or CrewAI.
* Strong problem\\-solving, analytical, and reasoning skills, with the ability to translate complex business challenges into agentic workflows.
* Excellent communication and storytelling abilities, capable of conveying complex AI concepts and system behaviors to both technical and non\\-technical stakeholders.
* Ability to manage and deliver multiple AI initiatives simultaneously, maintaining precision and quality across the lifecycle—from design to deployment.


**Preferred Skills And Experience**
* Degree in a quantitative or technical field such as Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Mathematics, or a related discipline.
* Professional certifications in AI, ML, or LLM development (e.g., Azure AI Engineer Associate, AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty, or equivalent).
* Experience with cloud\\-native AI platforms (Azure, AWS, or GCP) and modern MLOps/LLMOps practices.
* Familiarity with retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG), tool integration, API orchestration, and agent autonomy patterns.
