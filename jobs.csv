 At Microsoft, we believe in empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Join us, and help ensure our customers data is always safe, resilient, and ready for the future. Imagine this: You log into work on a Monday morning, and the code you wrote last week is already protecting petabytes of customer data across the globe. A new feature you designed is being used by Fortune 500 enterprises to keep their business running even when disaster strikes. Every commit you make has the potential to safeguard critical workloads for millions of users.
   

  

 This is not just another engineering role — this is your chance to build the platform that protects the cloud itself.
   

  

 The Azure Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) team is building a next\\-generation data protection and resiliency platform. With data volumes crossing into exabytes, we’re at the cutting edge of distributed storage and cloud resiliency. Our mission is to ensure every workload — VMs, containers, databases, file servers, blobs, and PaaS services — can be protected, restored, and trusted by our customers. We’re designing for massive scale with a multitenant, microservices\\-based architecture and generalized data store. This is an opportunity to shape a system that will be the foundation of Azure’s reliability story for years to come.
   

  

 What your journey will look like \\- In your first few months, you’ll dive deep into high\\-scale distributed storage systems, learning from some of the best engineers in the industry. You’ll own services end\\-to\\-end — designing, coding, testing, deploying, and operating — while seeing firsthand how your work runs in production. You’ll partner with teams across Azure to deliver seamless integrations and ensure data resiliency across the platform. Every sprint, you’ll tackle new challenges: making services faster, more durable, more secure, and more cost\\-efficient. You’ll live the “customer\\-obsessed, live\\-site first” culture, where solving real customer problems is as exciting as shipping new features.
   

  

 Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As employees we come together with a growth mindset, innovate to empower others, and collaborate to realize our shared goals. Each day we build on our values of respect, integrity, and accountability to create a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive at work and beyond.

 Turing is seeking experienced C/C\\+\\+ developers to partner with a leading AI research lab in validating and improving AI\\-generated code. In this role, you’ll review and correct complex systems code, enforce best practices, and guide how AI integrates with production\\-quality C/C\\+\\+ applications.
 



 This is a fully remote, highly flexible engagement — work from anywhere, on your own schedule. It’s a rare opportunity to apply your systems programming expertise to frontier AI research with real\\-world impact..
 



  





**What You’ll Do:** 



* Review and validate AI\\-generated C/C\\+\\+ code for correctness, reliability, and performance.
* Debug complex runtime issues and propose scalable fixes and patterns.
* Contribute to improving AI evaluation workflows and coding standards.
* Collaborate with AI researchers and engineers to refine code\\-generation quality.



  





**What We’re Looking For:** 



* Strong professional experience with modern C/C\\+\\+ (toolchains, build systems, debugging, performance optimization).
* Proven ability to improve and maintain large, complex codebases.
* Familiarity with AI\\-assisted code generation or evaluation workflows (nice to have).
* Excellent problem\\-solving skills and clear communication in English.



  





**Why You'll Love This Role:**
