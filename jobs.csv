 Our 
 **Search Platform** 
  sits at the heart of the Roku experience, powering voice, text, and visual discovery across 
 **100M\\+ active accounts** 
  and every Roku\\-powered device worldwide.
   

  We own the entire stack —from ingesting \\& enriching a multi\\-million\\-title knowledge graph, to low\\-latency retrieval services and large\\-scale machine\\-learning systems that personalize results in real time. Our work doesn’t just help users

**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.
