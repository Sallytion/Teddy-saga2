We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.
 



  
 


**About the team** 

 Our developers and engineers are owners. They take pride in solving problems end\\-to\\-end — from identifying an issue to building and shipping the solution. At Roku, engineers collaborate across embedded systems, cloud services, mobile apps, and UI design to create the best streaming experience in the world.
 



 You will be part of the Streaming Media and System Software team within Roku’s Core OS organization — the group behind the media playback engine, streaming protocols, and system services powering millions of Roku devices. This role is one of the first automation engineering hires in Bengaluru, working closely with experienced colleagues in the UK and US to build high\\-quality automation frameworks and tools for testing video playback at scale.

This is a unique opportunity to help establish local automation expertise while contributing to cutting\\-edge streaming technology.
 



 Roku is a global leader in streaming, connecting over 90 million active accounts to the entertainment they love. Since pioneering streaming in 2008, Roku has grown to power TVs, players, and audio devices worldwide, with 30\\.1 billion streaming hours in 2024\\. Our Bengaluru office is a hub of innovation, where we’re building the next generation of automation and media playback testing tools to keep Roku ahead in streaming quality.
 


  
 **About the role** 

 Join our Bengaluru team as a
 **Senior Software Engineer, Test (Automation)** 
 and take ownership of building world\\-class automated testing frameworks for media playback. In this role, you will design, develop, and maintain tools that test, monitor, and analyse performance metrics for millions of Roku players in the field.
 



 You will create a fully automated media player test suite, extend our in\\-house “mini\\-CDN” infrastructure with programmable network shapers, and develop adaptive content libraries to simulate real\\-world streaming conditions. Your work will cover VOD and live streams, clear and encrypted content, and integration with DRM license servers.
 



 In addition, you will help integrate AI/ML capabilities into our automation pipelines — from generating intelligent test cases to using ML models for anomaly detection in playback performance data.
 



 This role is ideal for an experienced SDET with
 **5\\+ years of strong Python programming experience**

* Build and manage an in\\-house test content library with adaptive streams, VOD streams, live streams, captions, and both encrypted and unencrypted streams.
* Build and maintain dedicated lab setups for automation testing, including release, regression, feature, and performance testing.
* Design and maintain server infrastructure for live video streaming and network condition simulation.
* Develop tools to monitor and analyse player performance in real time.
* Integrate AI/ML techniques into test automation workflows for:
	+ Automated test case generation
	+ Predictive performance analysis
	+ Intelligent log parsing and anomaly detection
* Review feature specifications, write test plans, and develop automated test cases.
* Schedule automated tests, monitor results, and track issues in Jira.


  
 **We’re excited if you have**

 in automation and tooling.
* Deep Linux/Unix expertise and experience working on embedded platforms.
* Experience with multiple automated testing frameworks, with the ability to choose the right one for the context.
* Proficiency in additional programming languages — C/C\\+\\+ a plus.
* Knowledge of network technologies and libraries such as TCP/IP and HTTP.
* Understanding of media/video concepts like codecs, streaming formats, adaptive streaming (HLS, DASH), and DRM technologies (media background a plus, not mandatory).
* Experience integrating AI/ML into testing workflows or curiosity and willingness to learn.
* Ability to learn new technologies quickly and work independently.
* Bachelor’s or master’s degree in computer science, electronics or other relevant streams.


**Benefits**

Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter.
 



  
 


**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.
