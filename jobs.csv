**Job Description**
 Mid\\-level Generative AI Application Developer:
   

  

 We are looking for an experienced Generative AI Application Developer to join our team and lead the design and implementation of AI\\-powered internal applications such as chatbots, copilots, and workflow automations. You will be responsible for building, integrating, and evolving generative AI applications that connect to Experian's internal systems and APIs, using modern Python frameworks and large language models. You will work with engineers, product, and partners to deliver, secure and scalable AI solutions that create value across the organisation.
   

  

 What you'll need to bring to the role \\& Experian
   

  

* A Bachelor's degree in computer science, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).
* 3–5 years of experience in software development, with at least 1–2 years hands\\-on building generative AI or ML\\-create applications.
* Programming skills in Python, including writing clean, modular, testable code; use virtual environments, dependency management, and packaging; debugging, logging, and error\\-handling in production services.
* Deep familiarity with generative AI concepts, such as LLMs, prompting, embeddings, tokens, model selection, safety/guardrails, and evaluation.
* I have over 1 year of experience with Python\\-based generative AI frameworks, such as LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, or similar orchestration frameworks. I can choose and structure frameworks appropriately, rather than using them as black boxes.
* Working knowledge of Model Context Protocol (MCP), tools/plugins, or equivalent connector patterns, and how agents securely call external systems.
* An understanding of how applications and APIs work end\\-to\\-end is important. This includes designing and consuming REST/HTTP APIs, which involves authentication, pagination, rate limiting, and error handling. Additionally, it involves building backend services or microservices, such as those using FastAPI, Flask, or similar technologies.
* Hands\\-on experience with databases and data access (ex: relational databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and ORMs/Query builders) and basic schema design and query optimisation for application workloads.
* Practical exposure to cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure), especially for hosting APIs and services, using managed databases, queues, and storage. Basic security, networking, and secrets management concepts.
* Experience working in Agile teams (Scrum/Kanban), using Git and CI/CD pipelines; comfortable participating in code reviews and improving engineering practices.
* Ability to mentor junior developers, give constructive feedback, and champion good coding standards and design practices.


 Work that matters \\- What you'll do
   

  

* Develop internal generative AI applications (chatbots, copilots and automations) that integrate with Experian systems and workflows.
* Develop and operate Python\\-based backends and APIs that connect LLMs to internal data sources, tools and business logic.
* Use frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI Agents / Assistants SDK to orchestrate prompts, tools, and agents.
* Shape and evolve RAG architectures, including document ingestion, embeddings/vector stores and retrieval flows, to improve relevance and quality.
* Implement guardrails, safety controls and fallbacks to ensure secure, reliable and compliant AI behaviour in production.
* Contribute to standards, documentation and mentoring, helping junior developers and the wider team adopt good practices in generative AI development.
* Participate in testing and evaluating AI applications to ensure they are, in consideration of our requirements, and safe to use (including checking prompts, guardrails, and failure modes).
* Collaborate with product and partners to understand use cases, define solutions, estimate effort and iterate based on feedback and metrics.


 More about you
   

  

* With a willingness to prototype by doing.
* Curiosity about how things work end\\-to\\-end: from the UI, through backend APIs, to the underlying models and data.
* Experience communicating updates and resolutions to customers and other partners and the ability to work collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team environment.
* Comfortable explaining technical concepts in simple terms to non\\-technical stakeholders.
* Team\\-oriented mindset, working closely with business users, analysts, developers, and other stakeholders.
* Experience reviewing code to find and address potential issues and defects, especially when testing and validating AI behaviour.
* Experience weighing specific technical tradeoffs to maximize impact for effort when designing prompts, tools, and user flows.
* Ethically aware of bias, hallucinations, privacy, and misinformation risks when designing and deploying AI solutions.


 Why this role is important to us
   

  

 This role is critical to how we adopt and scale Generative AI across the organization. You won't just be experimenting with new technology – you'll be shipping real AI products that colleagues rely on to work more efficiently and make better decisions. You are expected to own solutions end\\-to\\-end: from shaping internal use cases, to building robust RAG/LLM\\-powered services, and improving them over time. Your technical choices will influence our standards for AI architecture, safety, and quality. You'll also play a key part in uplifting the team, by sharing best practices, mentoring junior developers, and helping define how we build and operate AI systems at Experian. Over time, this role is a natural steppingstone towards senior technical leadership in AI application development, with a strong impact on how we responsibly use Generative AI on a scale.
   

  

**Qualifications**
* A Bachelor's degree in computer science, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).
* 3–5 years of experience in software development, with at least 1–2 years hands\\-on building generative AI or ML\\-create applications.

 Posting Statement
   

  

 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""
