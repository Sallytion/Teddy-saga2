 You will take ownership of one of these platforms and dedicate the majority of your time to constructing the most complex components of the codebase with a small team (3\\-5 experienced engineers, no junior developers). The architectural choices you make directly impact whether other teams can build new applications quickly, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Correct decisions unlock substantial leverage. Incorrect ones generate integration failures and eliminate velocity for multiple teams.
   

  

 You are responsible for building and operating what you design. You define quality standards and establish patterns for your platform. Our process is spec\\-driven: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. Expect high autonomy, no committees, no review boards.

* Technical Leadership: Make critical architectural decisions and define technical patterns that the team will follow.
* AI Leadership: Champion the adoption of emerging AI workflows and develop high\\-value playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the intricate, mission\\-critical portions of the codebase in collaboration with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify that your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality benchmarks.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Acting as an architect without writing code
* Spending time in endless meetings
