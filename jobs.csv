 Posting Statement
   

  

 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""

* Solution Architecture: Contribute to the technical design of enterprise\\-scale Shopify Plus stores, making critical decisions on theme architecture vs. custom app builds vs. third\\-party integrations.
* Advanced Integrations: Architect and implement secure connections between Shopify and enterprise systems (ERPs, CRMs, OMS, and PIMs) using GraphQL and REST APIs.
* Shopify Plus Mastery: Spearhead the implementation of advanced Plus features, including Checkout Extensibility, Shopify Functions, B2B logic, and complex metaobject architectures.
* Performance \\& Security: Support and help drive the end\\-to\\-end performance strategy and security posture for high\\-volume stores, ensuring scalability during peak traffic events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday).


**Required Skills \\& Experience**
* 5\\+ years of professional frontend or full\\-stack experience, with at least 3 years dedicated to the Shopify platform.
* Advanced Platform Knowledge: Expert\\-level mastery of Shopify Plus, including its limitations and extensibility points.
* API Expertise: Deep experience with the Shopify GraphQL Admin API and Storefront API.
* Backend Proficiency: Ability to build and maintain custom Shopify apps (Node.js/Remix or similar) or middleware when off\\-the\\-shelf solutions are insufficient.
* Modern Tooling: Expertise in Shopify CLI, CI/CD pipelines for commerce, and advanced Git workflows.
* Strategic Problem Solving: Proven track record of solving ""non\\-standard"" commerce problems that require moving beyond Liquid templates.


**Architectural Leadership**
* Technology Selection: Ability to articulate the trade\\-offs between different technical approaches (e.g., Headless vs. Hydrogen vs. Liquid\\-first) to both internal teams and clients.
* Problem Finding: A proactive approach to identifying technical debt or performance bottlenecks before they impact the merchant’s bottom line.


**Soft Skills**
* Leadership \\& Delegation: Strong ability to break down complex project goals into actionable tasks for other developers.

**Senior Shopify Engineer**
 We are seeking a Senior Shopify Engineer with lead potential to architect enterprise\\-level commerce solutions and steer our technical direction. This role requires a blend of deep frontend mastery and sophisticated backend integration skills, combined with the ability to navigate complex problem statements and mentor a growing development team.
   

  

**Role Overview**
 As a Senior Shopify Engineer, you will bridge the gap between business requirements and technical architecture. You will collaborate closely with our Lead Architect to contribute to technical discovery sessions, design custom integrations for Shopify Plus merchants, and own the development of the most complex platform features. A core part of this role involves technical leadership: you will navigate the solution path for complex projects, groom technical stories, and delegate specific implementation tasks to the Shopify Engineering team.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Collaborative Discovery: Work alongside the Architect during client\\-facing discovery sessions to identify technical risks and opportunities. Use your depth of experience to guide conversations and translate merchant needs into robust technical roadmaps.
* Advanced Development: Act as the primary developer for the most difficult and nuanced project components. You are expected to be hands\\-on, developing complex solutions rather than simply handing off designs.
* Backlog Grooming \\& Handoff: Define technical tasks and specifications for Shopify Engineers. Groom user stories into actionable development tasks, providing the necessary technical context for the base engineering team to succeed.
* Solution Architecture: Contribute to the technical design of enterprise\\-scale Shopify Plus stores, making critical decisions on theme architecture vs. custom app builds vs. third\\-party integrations.
* Advanced Integrations: Architect and implement secure connections between Shopify and enterprise systems (ERPs, CRMs, OMS, and PIMs) using GraphQL and REST APIs.
* Shopify Plus Mastery: Spearhead the implementation of advanced Plus features, including Checkout Extensibility, Shopify Functions, B2B logic, and complex metaobject architectures.
* Performance \\& Security: Support and help drive the end\\-to\\-end performance strategy and security posture for high\\-volume stores, ensuring scalability during peak traffic events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday).


**Required Skills \\& Experience**
* 5\\+ years of professional frontend or full\\-stack experience, with at least 3 years dedicated to the Shopify platform.
* Advanced Platform Knowledge: Expert\\-level mastery of Shopify Plus, including its limitations and extensibility points.
* API Expertise: Deep experience with the Shopify GraphQL Admin API and Storefront API.
* Backend Proficiency: Ability to build and maintain custom Shopify apps (Node.js/Remix or similar) or middleware when off\\-the\\-shelf solutions are insufficient.
* Modern Tooling: Expertise in Shopify CLI, CI/CD pipelines for commerce, and advanced Git workflows.
* Strategic Problem Solving: Proven track record of solving ""non\\-standard"" commerce problems that require moving beyond Liquid templates.


**Architectural Leadership**
* Technology Selection: Ability to articulate the trade\\-offs between different technical approaches (e.g., Headless vs. Hydrogen vs. Liquid\\-first) to both internal teams and clients.
* Problem Finding: A proactive approach to identifying technical debt or performance bottlenecks before they impact the merchant’s bottom line.


**Soft Skills**
* Leadership \\& Delegation: Strong ability to break down complex project goals into actionable tasks for other developers.
* Client Consultation: Excellent communication skills to lead technical discussions with enterprise\\-level stakeholders.
* Decision Making: Confidence in making high\\-stakes technical choices and standing by them under project pressure.
