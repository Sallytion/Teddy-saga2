 If you're ready to make an impact and grow your career, Legion is where you belong. Join us in making hourly work rewarding and fulfilling.
   

  

**BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY**
 There are almost 75 million hourly workers in the United States, representing more than half of the entire workforce. Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees. The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig\\-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options. Legion's mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by Legion's Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously.
   

  

 Legion WFM was built for the cloud with AI at the core and is designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses and meet the needs of today's hourly employees. Our team is composed of dedicated individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, globally distributed across all time zones.
