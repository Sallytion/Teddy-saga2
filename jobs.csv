Even with rudimentary automation in place, conventional QA approaches consistently miss critical bugs until after deployment, resulting in expensive setbacks and dissatisfied end users. Industry data indicates that more than 60% of software defects surface after release, with quality failures imposing a staggering $2 trillion annual cost on the global software sector. Delivering faster, dependable software requires a fundamental transformation in quality assurance strategy.
   

  

 IgniteTech is driving this transformation by embedding GenAI capabilities throughout the entire QA lifecycle. We leverage artificial intelligence to model user interactions, create sophisticated test scenarios, and evaluate defect patterns, enabling accelerated delivery with reduced bug counts. Joining our team positions you at the cutting edge of this shift, where AI eliminates bottlenecks and enables proactive problem detection.
   

  

 This position differs significantly from conventional QA roles. If you seek an environment centered on manual test execution or routine automation scripting, you will not find it here. In this role, you will take ownership of designing and advancing AI\\-powered test automation architectures, apply predictive analytics to surface latent risks, and influence the trajectory of software quality standards. You will engineer adaptive, scalable systems suited to the demands of contemporary development—not function within a static, legacy framework. If this aligns with the challenge you have been seeking, submit your application and contribute to the evolution of software development.

**Senior Quality Assurance Automation Engineer Key Responsibilities**

* A minimum of 2 years of professional experience in QA automation
* Demonstrated expertise with Selenium and at least one of the following programming languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
* Proven professional background utilizing AI tools to streamline QA processes
