**What You'll Do**
* Own services end‑to‑end: Design and ship multi‑tenant services (checkout, payments orchestration, subscriptions, settlement \\& reconciliation, invoicing, tax hooks).
* Integrate payments at depth: Add PSPs and local methods (cards/3DS, UPI, wallets, BNPL) with resilient webhooks and strictly idempotent APIs.
* Model money correctly: Implement an append‑only double‑entry ledger; use event sourcing/CQRS where it meaningfully improves correctness and scale.
* Raise the quality bar: Ship production‑grade code with contract, integration, property‑based, and performance tests; instrument everything with OpenTelemetry.
* Run it like you own it: Operate on GKE (GCP) with CI/CD, canaries, autoscaling, SLIs/SLOs, incident response, and on‑call participation.
* Collaborate \\& mentor: Partner closely with PM/Design and mentor SDE I/II engineers to multiply team impact.


**What You'll Lead**
* Cross‑service designs that connect orchestration → ledger → reconciliation with clear contracts and failure‑mode analysis.
* Reliability strategy: Define SLIs/SLOs, capacity models, and multi‑region failover plans; drive DR and chaos drills.
* Data lifecycle: Establish data retention/archival strategies compliant with regulatory requirements.
* Engineering excellence: Level‑up design reviews, postmortems, and technical strategy across the Payments \\& Commerce domain.


**Minimum Qualifications**
* 3–6\\+ years building backend services, with strong TypeScript/ Node.js and NestJS experience.
* Practical expertise with MongoDB and/or Firestore (transactions, indexing), plus cache design with Redis and event‑driven architecture (Kafka, GCP Pub/Sub).
* Strong grasp of distributed systems fundamentals: idempotency, retries/backoff \\& jitter, message ordering, de‑dup/outbox for “exactly‑once‑ish” processing, race conditions, concurrency control, and eventual consistency.
* Hands‑on with Kubernetes and at least one cloud (GCP preferred); familiarity with secrets/KMS and PCI basics.
* Deep testing discipline: unit, integration, contract, and performance testing.
* Schema design: Design and plan schemas with a focus on scalability and backward compatibility.
* Strong problem‑solving and debugging skills.


**Nice to have**
* Frontend: Vue 3 \\+ Vite.
* Data \\& analytics: BigQuery, Dataflow/Beam, Snowflake.
* Multi‑region design: Experience with latency budgets and consistency trade‑offs.
* Observability at scale and hands‑on chaos/DR practice.
* Prior experience at a fintech, payment processor, or e‑commerce company.


**What Success Looks Like (first 6–12 Months)**
* You own 1–2 services from design → production with P99 latency targets met and zero Sev‑1s caused by your changes.
* Failure retry rates drop by \\>30% through improved idempotency and retry/backoff policy.
* Codebases are measurably cleaner (coverage up, linting strict, typed contracts) and you actively mentor 2\\+ engineers.
* You define or sharpen SLIs/SLOs, capacity models, a multi‑region failover plan, and data retention/archival standards for your area.
