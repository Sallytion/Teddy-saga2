 We are looking for a sharp, detail\\-oriented QA Engineer who combines strong manual testing fundamentals with modern QA practices. You will act as the quality gatekeeper of the platform — manually testing complex workflows while applying structured API testing, shift\\-left testing, and exploratory methodologies.
 





 This role is not only about finding bugs. It is about thinking about product quality at every stage of development.
 



**Key Responsibilities** 
* Manually test web and mobile applications end\\-to\\-end
* Create detailed test plans, test cases, and test matrices from requirements and user stories
* Test complex multi\\-step workflows across multiple user roles and permissions
* Validate financial logic: invoicing, payments, deposits, credit notes, surcharges, and subscription billing
* Test third\\-party integrations (payment gateways, SMS/WhatsApp, push notifications, digital signatures)
* Perform structured API testing using Postman (validate requests, responses, error handling, and edge cases)
* Apply modern QA practices:
* Shift\\-left testing (early involvement in development)
* Risk\\-based testing
* Boundary value analysis
* Equivalence partitioning
* Decision table testing for complex business rules
* Perform cross\\-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
* Perform cross\\-device testing (iOS and Android)
* Verify multilingual UI (layout, translations, text overflow, number/date formatting per locale)
* Conduct exploratory testing using a session\\-based methodology
* Report bugs with clear reproduction steps, screenshots/recordings, severity, environment details, and root\\-cause hypothesis
* Track test coverage, defect trends, and quality metrics
* Collaborate early with developers and review features for testability
* Participate in standups, sprint planning (estimate QA effort), and demos


**Profile We’re Looking For** 
* 2\\+ years of hands\\-on manual QA experience (web and mobile)
* Strong foundation in manual testing:
* Test case design
* Test planning
* Regression, smoke, and sanity testing
* Knowledge of modern QA techniques:
* Boundary value analysis
* Equivalence partitioning
* State transition testing
* Decision table testing
* Pairwise testing
* Strong exploratory testing skills (session\\-based test management and heuristics such as SFDPOT and HICCUPPS)
* Solid API testing using Postman or Insomnia (can independently test endpoints, chain requests, validate schemas, and test error scenarios)
* Experience testing complex business logic (state machines, financial calculations, conditional workflows, role\\-based access)
* Basic SQL (query PostgreSQL to verify backend data integrity)
* Cross\\-browser and cross\\-device testing experience
* Risk\\-based testing mindset (prioritizes testing based on impact and likelihood)
* Clear, structured communication with developers and stakeholders
* Continuous learning mindset and interest in evolving QA practices


**Nice\\-to\\-Have (Big Plus)** 
* Basic automation testing exposure
* BrowserStack or similar cloud device platforms
* Experience testing payment or financial systems
* Performance testing awareness
* Security testing fundamentals
* Contract testing concepts (e.g., Pact)
* Accessibility testing (WCAG basics)
* Experience on ERP, CRM, or booking platforms


**Goal of the Role** 


 Own quality across the entire platform — web, mobile, and API.
 





 You will not simply execute tests; you will design testing strategies, analyze risks, test at the API layer, catch issues early, and ensure stable releases reach users.
 




  





**Budget:** 

 1 Lakh INR / month
 




**Location:** 

 Kolkata, India (Hybrid)
