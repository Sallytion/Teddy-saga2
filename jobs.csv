 Location: On\\-site (Noida)
 



 Company: Proeffico Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
 



 Product: Vizo361 – AI Video Analytics Platform
 



  





**About Us** 




 We are building Vizo361, an AI Video Analytics platform that turns CCTV cameras into intelligent decision systems.
 



 Our system already includes modules like:
 



 • Fire \\& smoke detection
 



 • Facial recognition based attendance
 



 • Footfall analytics
 



 • Human activity monitoring
 



 • Industrial safety monitoring (PPE, restricted zones, etc.)
 



  





**We are not a service company — we are building a product \\+ AI infrastructure stack.** 




  





 This internship is for someone who wants to become a real Computer Vision Engineer, not just run pre\\-trained models.
 



  





**Role Overview** 




  





 You will work directly on real production video streams and help us build, train, deploy and optimize computer vision systems.
 



 Your work will go into an actual deployed product used by clients — not academic assignments.
 



  





**You will deal with:** 




 • noisy CCTV feeds
 



 • low light conditions
 



 • motion blur
 



 • real\\-time inference constraints
 



 • GPU memory limits
 



 • model failures in real environments
 



  





 This role is closer to AI systems engineering than pure research.
 



  





**What You Will Do** 




 • Work on real\\-time video analytics pipelines
 



 • Train and fine\\-tune detection/recognition models
 



 • Implement tracking (multi\\-object tracking)
 



 • Build dataset pipelines (annotation → training → evaluation → improvement)
 



 • Optimize inference latency on GPU/CPU edge systems
 



 • Integrate AI models into backend services
 



 • Debug model failures from production footage
 



 • Work with RTSP/RTMP camera streams
 



  





**You will also:** 




 • handle bad datasets
 



 • fix broken annotations
 



 • analyze false positives
 



 • improve accuracy iteratively
 



  





**Must Have (Very Important)** 




  





 We do not select candidates based only on knowing YOLO/OpenCV.
 



  





 You must know basic engineering tools:
 



  





**Core Skills** 




 • Python (good understanding, not just notebooks)
 



 • Linux command line (navigation, permissions, services, logs)
 



 • Git (branching, pull requests, resolving conflicts)
 



 • Debugging mindset
 



  





**Computer Vision** 




 • OpenCV
 



 • Image processing basics
 



 • Object detection concepts (bounding boxes, IoU, NMS)
 



 • Understanding of how training works (datasets, epochs, overfitting, augmentation)
 



  





**Good to Have** 




 • YOLO / Detectron / MMDetection
 



 • PyTorch
 



 • Video streaming (RTSP/FFmpeg/GStreamer)
 



 • Docker
 



 • Basic networking (ports, IP, NAT)
 



 • Model optimization (TensorRT / ONNX)
 



  





**What We Expect (Very Important)** 




  





 We are not looking for certificate collectors.
 



  





 You should:
 



 • be comfortable reading GitHub repositories
 



 • run models from source

 And, if you're already nodding along, let's start the conversation.
 



  





**What is ServiceAgent?** 




 For service\\-based businesses that struggle with handling calls, scheduling, billing, and customer communication,
 **ServiceAgent** 
 is an AI Operations Platform that replaces multiple front office, back office roles and tools with AI Agents, so that businesses can run 24/7 operations, capture more revenue, cut labor cost, and eliminate software clutter.
 



 Unlike AI receptionist apps, virtual assistants, or disconnected SaaS tools,ServiceAgent combines AI calling, CRM, payments, invoicing, scheduling, and follow\\-ups inside one platform \\- free to use, paid only when it performs.
 



  





**About the Role** 




 We are looking for a high\\-impact early
 **Sales Engineer**

* Deliver tailored product demos and proofs\\-of\\-concept (POCs) aligned to each prospect's workflow and technical setup.
* Drive trial success end\\-to\\-end, ensuring customers achieve early value and move confidently toward proposal and purchase.
* Build and maintain MSP / Project Progress Tracker documents with clear milestones, defined use cases, and success criteria for key opportunities.
* Enable data\\-driven selling by leveraging PQL scores and product usage insights to nudge customers toward next steps.



  





**What’ll Make You a Great Match** 



* **Ability to Chase \\& Close** 
 \\- a proven track record of taking cold or warm leads and converting them into paid users/customers.
* **Elite Verbal Communication \\& High EQ** 
 \\- show the ability to articulate, have the knack of reading the room instantly and carry high energy.
* **High Agency and Go Getter Attitude** 
 \\- no hiding. Treat the onboarding funnel and sales pipeline as your own. Look to solve problems on your feet without losing sight of execution.
* **1\\-4 years of experience in sales / pre\\-sales / solution engineering** 
 . 0\\-1 or 1\\-10 or founder’s office experience will be a major plus.
* You love working in the
 **US markets** 
 .



  





**Because Life’s Too Short For Boring Jobs** 



* Take time off when you need it. We trust you to manage your energy and schedule responsibly.
* We don’t track hours, just impact. Work when you’re most productive, as long as you show up for your team.
* Competitive pay that reflects your skills, experience, and the value you bring.
