**Required Skills/Experience**
 6\\-8\\+ years of full\\-stack development experience with Go, Java, and Python, including strong proficiency in modern application development, API design, cloud services (databases, storage, messaging), containerization, and experience with integrating AI/agentic capabilities into user experience as well as backend where applicable.
   

  

 3\\-5\\+ years of experience with modern web\\-based IAM technologies, such as authentication (SSO/Okta), authorization, identity governance and access management (Sailpoint), and privileged access management (PAM).
   

  

 2\\-3\\+ years of front\\-end development experience; familiarity with frameworks and libraries such as React, Chakra UI, Redux Toolkit, and Axios is a plus, especially where improving user experience through AI\\-assisted interactions is beneficial.
   

  

 Strong understanding and working experience of AWS cloud infrastructure and services, including containers, Kubernetes, and Microservices architecture.
   

  

 High proficiency with JSON, XML, and RESTful development practices, including designing APIs that may support AI\\-driven or agentic workflows.
   

  

 Hands\\-on experience with secure coding, defensive programming, and modern CI/CD workflows using Git and Jenkins (including shell scripting for pipeline jobs).
   

  

 Strong analytical, problem\\-solving, communication, and collaboration skills, with excellent attention to detail.

 Posting Statement
   

  

 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""
