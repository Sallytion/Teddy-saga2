* Automation \\& Engineering Excellence
* Build, extend, and maintain automated test suites for UI, API, and backend services.
* Improve test reliability by identifying and fixing flaky tests.
* Drive reduction in manual regression time through automation ROI.
* Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines and ensure fast feedback cycles.
* Collaborate with developers to shift quality left (testability, better coverage, early validation).


**What we are looking for?**
* 4\\+ years of experience in software quality engineering.
* Strong ability to design high\\-quality test scenarios from ambiguous requirements.
* Hands\\-on experience in test automation using tools like Selenium, Playwright, Webdriver.io, or similar.
