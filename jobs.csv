 Established in 2022 in Kothrud, Pune, Micromation Systems is a partnership\\-based firm manufacturing CNC machines, PID controllers, pH controllers, and more. We also create custom\\-made fully automated machines for various job types. Our products are known for their premium quality, seamless finish, unique patterns, and affordable prices. With a commitment to timely delivery, we have gained a significant client base in the market.
 



**Role Description This** 
 is a full\\-time, on\\-site role for an Automation Software Trainee. The primary focus of this role will be the development of a PC\\-based Human\\-Machine Interface (HMI) for our next\\-generation motion control systems and assisting in the testing and validation of the entire system.
 



 The trainee will work directly with our lead embedded systems engineer. While the core embedded firmware will be provided, you will be responsible for creating the powerful C\\+\\+ desktop application that communicates with it. This is a critical role that bridges the gap between the machine and the operator.
 



**Day\\-to\\-day responsibilities will include:** 



* Designing and developing a high\\-performance HMI application from the ground up using
 **C\\+\\+** 
 and the
 **Qt framework** 
 .
* Implementing a
 **TCP/IP Ethernet communication** 
 protocol to send real\\-time commands and receive status data from our STM32\\-based embedded controller.
* Creating a live
 **2D visualization module** 
 within the HMI to plot the machine's toolpath and provide real\\-time feedback to the operator.
* Developing and executing comprehensive test plans to validate the communication link and the accuracy of the motion control system.
* Troubleshooting and debugging issues at the system level, involving both the PC application and its interaction with the embedded device.
* Documenting the software architecture and testing procedures.


**Qualifications** 

 We are looking for a candidate with a foundational knowledge of software development and a keen interest in automation and robotics. You will be testing and validating the embedded code developed by our senior engineer.
 


* Strong programming skills in
 **C\\+\\+** 
 and a good understanding of Object\\-Oriented principles.
* Excellent
 **Analytical and Troubleshooting capabilities** 
 , with a methodical approach to debugging.
* Effective communication skills, with the ability to collaborate closely with the embedded engineering team.
* Ability to work independently on well\\-defined tasks and manage your time effectively.
* Relevant educational background in Computer Science, Information Technology, Electronics, or a related engineering field.


**Preferred Skills (Nice to Have)** 
* Prior experience with a GUI framework, especially
 **Qt** 
 .
* Basic understanding of
 **TCP/IP networking** 
 concepts (sockets, clients, servers).
* Experience with 2D graphics, plotting, or any form of data visualization.
* Familiarity with reading and understanding embedded C code for testing purposes.



**What We Offer:** 



* **Direct Mentorship:** 
 You will work one\\-on\\-one with our lead engineer, gaining direct mentorship and insights that are rare in larger companies. This is a unique opportunity to learn from an experienced professional in the field.
* **High\\-Impact Project Ownership:** 
 This is not a typical internship where you'll be given minor tasks. You will be the primary developer for a critical component of our product—the HMI. Your work will directly influence the final product and you'll have a significant, tangible project for your portfolio.
* **End\\-to\\-End Experience:** 
 You will see a real\\-world project through from the design phase, to development, testing, and final integration. This complete lifecycle experience is incredibly valuable for your future career.
* **Flexibility:** 
 As a startup, we can offer flexible working hours from home to accommodate your academic schedule.
* **Internship Credit \\& Stipend:** 
 This position is eligible for university internship credit. We also offer a monthly stipend to help cover travel and meal expenses.
