 At Prodigal, we are driven by a singular, unrelenting purpose: to transform how consumer finance companies engage with their customers and, in turn, drive successful outcomes for all.
   

  

**About The Role**
 This is not a traditional engineering role. This is a seat at the table.
   

  

 You will work directly with Prodigal's CTO across the full breadth of building a frontier AI company — technical roadmap, AI projects, customer conversations, GTM collaboration, hiring, and everything in between. Think of it as an accelerated apprenticeship for a future CTO or technical founder. You will be handed ambiguity, context, and trust — and expected to run with it. Over one year, you will touch more dimensions of company building than most engineers see in a decade.
   

  

 We are looking for someone in explore mode — technically sharp, intellectually restless, and hungry to understand how great companies are built from the inside.
   

  

 What You'll Own
   

  

 AI Projects \\& Technical Execution
   

  

* Lead high\\-priority AI projects end\\-to\\-end — voice AI, LLM reasoning, evaluation frameworks, and agentic systems — from research to production
* Work hands\\-on with frontier models, prompt engineering, real\\-time voice pipelines, and PIE, Prodigal's Intelligence Engine powering millions of live consumer finance conversations
* Evaluate emerging AI capabilities and support pragmatic build\\-vs\\-integrate decisions alongside the CTO


 Strategy, Customers \\& GTM
   

  

* Participate in roadmap discussions, competitive analysis, and translating customer insights into engineering direction
* Join customer conversations and escalations; collaborate with Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success on technical enablement and thought leadership that represents Prodigal at the cutting edge


 Hiring, Culture \\& Operations
   

  

* Participate in recruiting — evaluating submissions, interviewing, building assessment frameworks — particularly for campus hiring from premier institutions
* Be a sounding board for architectural decisions, tradeoffs, and team dynamics; help identify gaps before they become problems


 What You Bring
   

  

* Strong CS fundamentals with hands\\-on Python and/or TypeScript — you write clean, production\\-ready code
* 0 to 5 years of experience; in explore mode, not exploit mode — still building, still hungry, not optimizing a narrow lane
* Genuine curiosity about AI — you read papers, build side projects, and form opinions about where the technology is heading
* High bias for action, comfort with ambiguity, and clear communication across engineers, customers, and executives
* A builder's mentality — you've made things that required sustained effort to bring into existence


 Even Better
   

  

* Hands\\-on experience with LLMs — prompt engineering, evaluation, fine\\-tuning, or building LLM\\-powered applications
* Exposure to voice AI, real\\-time systems, or agentic architectures
* Considering a Masters in CS or AI, or recently completed one


 Why This Role
   

  

 Compounding Learning at an Uncommon Pace
   

  

 Most early\\-career engineers spend years getting depth in one domain. This role gives you breadth and depth simultaneously — AI, product, customers, hiring, company building — all in one year, directly alongside a technical co\\-founder.
   

  

 Proximity to the Frontier
   

  

 Voice AI that reasons, decides, and acts in real\\-time financial conversations is one of the hardest applied AI problems being worked on right now. You will be building it, not reading about it.
   

  

 A Blueprint for What You Want to Become
   

  

 Whether you want to be a CTO, a technical founder, or a world\\-class AI researcher — this role is designed to accelerate that path. Real ownership, real stakes, increasing responsibility as you demonstrate it.
   

  

**Job Benefits**
* World\\-class team \\- You'll get the chance to learn from (and teach) some of the brightest and most skilled people you'll ever meet. Our team members have been part of BCG, Deloitte, EY, Blackstone, Meta, Amazon and are IIT, IIM, BITS alumnus.
* Continuous education \\- As relentless seekers of knowledge, we sponsor and support any training materials, books, courses, and exam fees for upskilling yourself in areas related to your role \\- but that's not where it ends. If you make a good case for some extra learning, we're delighted to foot the tab.
* Food at the office – Meals are on us. We won't let your stomach grumble while you hustle.
* Health insurance \\- Health always comes first. The health of your family is as important to us, as it is to you. We offer insurance coverage for both you and your family.
* Flexible schedule \\- We're not a ""clock in, clock out"" company. Morning person? Start work while the world's still sleeping. Night owl? Ramp things up while others are winding down. You're fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you be available to your teammates for seamless collaboration.
* Generous leave policy \\- Take all the time you need to recharge your batteries \\- no cap on vacation allowance here. Because a rested, relaxed, and refreshed mind is a happy and effective mind.
* Recreation \\& team activities – We regularly indulge in friendly football, table tennis, cooking sessions and challenge each other to do those extra push ups or chug that 4th drink (of course that’s Nimbu Pani)


**Meet Sangram \\- (Cofounder and CTO) and hear his vision for Prodigal below (01:38\\)**
 From day 1, Prodigal has been defined by talented, humble, and hungry leaders and we want this mindset and culture to continue to blossom from top to bottom in the company.

"li-4376708066","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4376708066","","Embedded System - FPGA & SoC Performance Engineer","CynLr","Bengaluru, Karnataka, India","","fulltime","","","","","",False,"mid-senior level","Engineering and Information Technology","","","**About CynLr** 




 Just like a baby’s brain, CynLr Visual Intelligence stack makes Robots to instinctively see \\& pick any object under any ambience, without any training. (a demo video link).
 



 Today, a robot that can fit a screw into a nut without slipping a thread, doesn’t exist. Imagine what it would take for a robot to assemble a Smartphone or a car by putting together 1000s of parts with varied shapes and weights, all in random orientations. Thus, factories become complex, needing heavy customization of their environment.
 



 CynLr\\-enabled visual robots
 *intuitively learn to handle even unknown objects, on\\-the\\-fly,* 
 eliminating the need for rigid fixtures, pre\\-training, or environment customization. This enables an universal alternative to custom automation thus simplifying factory lines into
 *modular LEGO\\-like micro\\-factories* 
 that can be rapidly reconfigured as products change.
 



 At the core of CynLr lies a fundamentally new approach to machine vision. Unlike conventional vision systems that rely on image recognition and heuristics, CynLr’ s Vision and ML stacks are
 *deeply inspired by neuroscience,* 
 modelling how biological vision understands shape, geometry, and interaction rather than appearance alone. To support this, CynLr builds its hardware, sensors, compute pipelines, and learning stacks from scratch, tightly coupling perception, decision\\-making, and action.
 



 This integration allows CynLr to operate in conditions that defeat traditional automation: variable lighting, cluttered environments, unknown objects, and high precision manipulation, unlocking automation use cases that have remained unsolved for decades. By rethinking vision as an intelligent, adaptive sense rather than a static tool, CynLr is redefining how robots perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world.
 



  





**About the Role:** 




 Product Design begins as a hypothetical concept. Transforming that concept into a functional Product is a highly creative and experimental process that requires a strong understanding of system\\-level fundamentals and application\\-driven trade\\-offs.
 



 In FPGA\\-based embedded systems, the utility and limitations of a product are defined by how effectively the FPGA platform is configured, integrated, and used at the system and application level. Performance, latency, determinism, and I/O capability depend on IP selection, configuration, firmware integration, and system architecture.
 



 You will be responsible for the application\\-level design, integration, validation, and deployment of FPGA\\-based embedded systems. The Product Design team will be your internal customer.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities:** 



* Supporting CynLr’s Product Design team with all FPGA application and system\\-level activities.
* FPGA platform configuration and integration using vendor\\-provided IP cores and reference designs.
* System bring\\-up, validation, and debugging of FPGA\\-based hardware platforms.
* Verification \\& Validation (V\\&V)
* Defining test procedures for FPGA\\-based systems and firmware
* Executing tests and validating manufactured PCBs and assemblies
* Interfacing with vendors (FPGA vendors, IP providers, PCB manufacturers, component suppliers, simulation and service providers) to plan and coordinate successful project execution.
* Acting as the FPGA application and system knowledge base for design engineers and freshers joining the organization.



  





**Team Structure \\& Career Path:** 




 This role resides in the Electronics team and is part of the larger hardware team. The role has touchpoints with other teams most notably the Product Design team. We are a startup and there is a tremendous potential to build your own team or grow into a principal engineer role over time in the space or expand into other areas.
 



  





**Job Requirements** 




 Below are some key requirements. We expect working knowledge in most areas and deep hands\\-on expertise in either FPGA or SoC
 



**A. Electronics \\& System Fundamentals:** 



* Strong understanding of digital electronics and system\\-level architecture.
* Solid understanding of register\\-based systems and memory architectures (DDR, SRAM, Flash).
* Working knowledge of power distribution and sequencing for FPGA\\-based systems.
* Understanding of processor and accelerator architectures (ARM\\-based SoC FPGAs).



**B. FPGA Application \\& Platform Development:** 



* Hands\\-on experience with FPGA or SoC\\-FPGA.
* Strong familiarity with FPGA vendor toolchains (Vivado, Quartus, Libero).
* Experience configuring and integrating:
* Vendor\\-provided IP cores
* Memory controllers
* Communication and data\\-movement IP Blocks
* Ability to generate FPGA bitstreams using existing IP and reference designs.



**C. Embedded Firmware Design \\& Development:** 



* Strong experience in embedded firmware development using C/C\\+\\+.
* Experience developing firmware for ARM cores inside FPGA SoCs
* Experience with bare\\-metal or RTOS\\-based systems.
* Ability to develop and debug drivers for memory\\-mapped peripherals.
* Good understanding of boot flows, BSPs, and build systems.



**D. Interfaces \\& Communication:** 



* Strong working knowledge of communication protocols:
* UART, SPI, I2C, AXI
* Ethernet, USB
* Experience debugging data flow, latency, and performance issues at the system level.



**E. Verification and Validation:** 



* Adept in using JTAG\\-based debugging tools.
* Experience with system bring\\-up and validation of FPGA\\-based boards.
* Experience using:
* Logic analyzers
* Oscilloscopes
* Vendor\\-provided tools (Vivado, Quartus, Libero)
* Ability to create and execute test procedures and validation plans.
* Ability to debug data flow and performance bottlenecks at the system level.



**F. Behavioural Tendency:** 




 Critical Thinking, Available, Responsible, Versatile, Resourceful, Thorough, Attention to Details \\& “Humble”.
 



  





**What Will You Do:** 




 CynLr’ s vision system is central in the control loop of the vision guided manipulation platform. The stereo vision system is acquiring at 75 FPS and this means processing must also happen at this speed or higher and the processing method based on neural network is computationally intensive as it involves a high level of successive matrix multiplication. For this the processing is split between multiple processing units FPGA, GPU and CPU based on the type of processing that is required. Your focus will be majorly on the FPGA, working closely with the Product Design team to build and deploy FPGA\\-based embedded systems at the application and system level. This includes configuring FPGA platforms using vendor tools and IP, developing embedded firmware to control and interface with FPGA logic, bringing up and validating hardware, and debugging system\\-level issues involving interfaces, memory, and peripherals. You will define and execute verification and validation procedures, support prototypes and manufacturing builds, and ensure reliable system behaviour in real\\-world use. This role focuses on integration, firmware, and system validation
 



  





**How Will You Do:** 




 Though confined to a focused area, the work is pretty much expected to be entrepreneurial with the exact advantages and difficulties of a startup. Since this is a startup and the product will evolve at a rapid pace, the contours of the technology, toolchain \\& Process will have to constantly adapt to the changes. You will participate in actively contributing in building the process \\& tool chain too. You will have complete freedom here, but you will be subjected to reviews.
