 We’re seeking a hands\\-on engineer to accelerate developer productivity and engineering quality by operationalizing GitHub Copilot (Business/Enterprise) across the SDLC, with a strong focus on secure, governed adoption. You will design and maintain Copilot customization assets (prompt files, custom instructions, reusable agents) for common .NET delivery workflows, and build supporting GenAI services on Azure where needed. You will partner with platform engineering, security, and product teams to define guardrails, measure impact (productivity, quality, and risk), and continuously improve developer experience. This role is strictly involved in continuous improvement in productivity and enhancing the process and does not involve access to Protected Health Information (PHI) \\& Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or any secured/confidential client data. The work is limited to application testing and does not include handling or processing of sensitive health information.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
**GitHub Copilot Enablement \\& Productization**
* Own and evolve an enterprise\\-ready Copilot enablement approach: usage patterns, prompt standards, and governance for regulated environments.
* Create and curate a repository\\-backed library of reusable prompt files (.github/prompts) for common engineering scenarios (bug fixes, brownfield enhancements from user stories, refactoring, test generation, security remediation).
* Author and maintain custom instruction files (repository and organization patterns) to enforce coding standards, architecture conventions, error handling, logging, and testing practices.
* Design interactive ‘guided’ prompts that ask one question at a time, minimize friction for low adopters, and require user confirmation before applying code changes.
* Collaborate with teams to integrate Copilot into day\\-to\\-day workflows in Visual Studio and GitHub (PR templates, checklists, review guidance).


**Guardrails, Security \\& Quality**
* Define and implement guardrails so AI\\-assisted code can’t land without required quality and security signals (tests, reviews, and automated scanning).
* Configure and enforce GitHub Advanced Security practices where applicable (CodeQL code scanning, dependency review/alerts, secret scanning/push protection) and integrate results into PR gating.
* Establish measurement for AI\\-assisted development: Copilot usage metrics (suggested vs added LOC, acceptance actions) and repo outcomes (review cycle time, defect inflow proxies, security findings), with clear limitations and directional interpretation.
* Partner with AppSec and compliance stakeholders to ensure safe handling of sensitive data in prompts, logs, and test artifacts.
* NET Engineering \\& Platform Integration
* Contribute to and review C\\#/.NET codebases (ASP.NET Core, EF Core) to ensure Copilot guidance and templates match real architecture and patterns.
* Build small, maintainable developer tooling and automation (e.g., GitHub Actions, internal utilities, code generators where appropriate) that complements Copilot rather than replacing engineering discipline.
* Create and maintain sample reference implementations and ‘golden paths’ that demonstrate secure patterns, test\\-first fixes, and high\\-quality PRs.


**GenAI Solution Engineering (Supporting)**
* Develop LLM\\-powered workflows on Azure (Azure OpenAI) to support developer experience and engineering insights (e.g., PR summarization, guided debugging, quality dashboards).
* Implement prompt contracts, tool/function calling patterns, and evaluation harnesses for reliability, cost, and safety.
* Where needed, build retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and connectors to enterprise knowledge sources with grounding/citations.


**Qualifications**
**Must\\-Have**
* 5–7 years of software engineering experience delivering production systems with strong engineering discipline (testing, reviews, CI/CD).
* Hands\\-on experience using GitHub Copilot in professional development workflows; ability to design and operationalize prompt files, custom instructions, and reusable agent\\-like workflows for teams.
* Practical experience with .NET (C\\#) and modern application development (ASP.NET Core and/or EF Core); able to read, debug, and implement changes confidently.
* Strong GitHub fundamentals: branching strategies, PR\\-based delivery, code reviews, and GitHub Actions (or equivalent CI).
* Security\\-minded engineering: familiarity with secure coding practices and integrating automated checks (SAST, dependency scanning, secret detection) into the delivery pipeline.
* Azure fundamentals for deploying services (App Service/Functions/Container Apps) and secure configuration (Key Vault, RBAC).
* Ability to convert moderately detailed requirements into clear designs (ADRs/sequence diagrams) and production\\-ready implementations.


**Nice\\-to\\-Have**
* GitHub Copilot administration experience (policy management, organizational customization, adoption measurement and reporting).
* Experience building developer tooling or IDE extensions (Visual Studio/VS Code), internal CLIs, or PR automation.
* Hands\\-on with GitHub Advanced Security (CodeQL, secret scanning, dependency review/Dependabot) and rulesets/required checks for merge gating.
* Experience with Azure OpenAI, prompt evaluation, and/or RAG (Azure AI Search or equivalent).
* Data engineering and analytics experience for telemetry pipelines and dashboards (SQL, data modeling, Power BI).


**Core Competencies**
* Developer Productivity Leadership: pragmatic enablement, playbooks, and training that drive real adoption.
* System Design: clear, scalable architecture with documented trade\\-offs.
* Code Quality: readable, tested, maintainable code with robust error handling.
* Security \\& Governance: secure\\-by\\-default patterns, auditability, and responsible AI practices.
* Measurement \\& Insights: metrics that are transparent, repeatable, and grounded in tooling constraints.


**What Success Looks Like (Outcomes)**
* Copilot customization assets (prompts/instructions/workflows) that materially improve cycle time and developer experience without compromising quality or security.
* Clear, trustworthy reporting of Copilot adoption and impact, including known limitations of telemetry and measurement.
* Reduced friction for common work (small fixes, bug triage, test creation) through repeatable Copilot\\-guided workflows that keep developers in control.
* Well\\-governed, secure AI\\-assisted development practices aligned with enterprise standards.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/gainwell-technologies","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGcFPkbuWj9Mw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1720034743163/gainwell_technologies_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=dWZJiRq5QFoN9K4BLykuls2EyfKgOOFhJ4CHlk6oR0o","","","","","","","","","","",""

**Senior Machine Learning Platform Engineer**
**Why This Role Matters**
 This role powers Tekion's AI‑native, end‑to‑end automotive platform by turning unified dealership data across DMS, CRM, Digital Retail, Service, and Payments into real‑time intelligence. You'll operationalize a graph‑based contextual ecosystem so agents can retrieve the right context, enforce policy, and personalize experiences that drive measurable dealer outcomes. You'll also build the resilient control layer \\- MCP and the LLM Gateway \\- that enables safe, cost‑efficient, multi‑provider LLM usage. Finally, you'll define the standards for building, evaluating, deploying, and governing agentic systems so product teams can ship AI features quickly, safely, and at scale. In addition to enabling agentic systems powered by LLMs, this role also drives building the platform for classical ML models driving optimization across dealership operations.
   

  

**What Makes This Opportunity Unique**
 This role offers direct, measurable impact on dealer outcomes and consumer experiences across Tekion's Automotive Retail Cloud and Automotive Enterprise Cloud, with end‑to‑end ownership of an LLM control plane and gateway that serve multi‑tenant workloads under SLAs and, quality and cost guardrails. You'll leverage a rich vertical dataset and domain graph spanning sales, service, parts, F\\&I, accounting, and consumer touchpoints to power context‑aware agents and retrieval‑augmented generation. You'll also shape core levers \\- agent orchestration patterns, evaluation frameworks, and safety guardrails \\- so improvements in latency, reliability, evaluation quality, and safety translate into dealer KPIs like upsell, cycle time, CSAT, and service revenue. You'll also maintain and enhance the platform to support classical supervised and unsupervised ML models .
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Build and run the LLM control plane/gateway: smart routing, rate limits/quotas, failover, and token/cost tracking.
* Ship a unified API and SDKs (REST/gRPC) with normalized schemas, structured outputs, caching, and full observability (traces/logs/metrics).
* Enforce safety and privacy by default: content filtering, prompt/response validation, and PII redaction.
* Enable multi‑model, multi‑vendor use LLMs with automated canarying and versioning.
* Own the agent runtime: tool registry, permissions, function calling, grounding, and retrieval.
* Design orchestration patterns (sequential, planner‑executor, streaming) and manage agent state and long‑running workflows.
* Enabling platform components for training and scoring pipelines for classical ML (e.g., XGBoost/LightGBM/linear/trees) and deep models; standardize experiment tracking and packaging.
* Create components to Monitor model and data drift, retraining and tuning models as needed to maintain accuracy and relevance.
* Add human‑in‑the‑loop review and safe‑actioning before agents touch dealer systems.
* Evolve the domain graph and entity resolution; build reliable data ingestion pipelines.
* Serve real‑time context to agents (profiles, inventory, pricing, appointments, service history) with access controls and lineage.
* Power retrieval with hybrid search (graph \\+ vector \\+ keyword) and smart cache/TTL to balance accuracy, latency, and cost.
* Run continuous offline/online evaluations for quality, factuality, bias, and safety for the platform sanity.
* Define SLOs for latency (p50/p95\\), uptime, and cost view capabilities; enable autoscaling and spend controls.
* Maintain a model/agent registry, versioning, approvals, audit trails, and reproducibility; support compliances where needed.
* Provide templates/CLIs, sandboxes, and docs so product teams can build and ship fast; mentor engineers and champion MLOps and AI safety best practices.


**Desired Skills \\& Experience**
* 5 \\- 7 years building large‑scale data/ML or platform systems; strong software engineering fundamentals (Abstracted API design, concurrency, distributed systems).
* Production experience with Python plus one of Java/Scala/Go; microservices and API design.
* MLOps at scale: pipelines (Airflow/Kubeflow), tracking/registry (MLflow), CI/CD for models, A/B testing, shadow/canary, and online feature computation (Spark/Flink/Kafka).
* Cloud and containers: AWS (preferred), plus Docker/Kubernetes; performance, reliability, and cost engineering in multi‑tenant SaaS.
* Practical ML knowledge (feature engineering, training, evaluation, drift detection); experience deploying models that power user‑facing workflows.
* Built or operated an LLM gateway/control plane: provider adapters, routing/policies, caching, quota/rate‑limit, cost and token accounting.
* Agentic systems: tool use/function calling, orchestration frameworks, human‑in‑the‑loop, safety/guardrails, and online evaluation/telemetry.
* Graph and retrieval: knowledge graphs (e.g., Neo4j/Neptune/TigerGraph), GraphQL, vector search (e.g., pgvector/Qdrant/Milvus), hybrid retrieval patterns.


**Preferred Mindset**
* Platform‑as‑product: obsess over developer experience, paved roads, and clear SLAs.
* Thinks in systems \\- observability, fallback, access control are core, not afterthoughts.
* Passionate about AI \\- enjoys enabling real\\-world LLM and agentic use cases.
* Cost‑aware builder: you treat latency and dollars as first‑class metrics and design for graceful degradation.
* Vendor‑agnostic thinker: choose the right model/provider per use case; build for portability and resilience.
* Documentation and teaching: you make complex systems understandable; you uplevel teams.
