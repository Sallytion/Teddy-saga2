**About Us:** 




 Nitro Commerce is a fast\\-moving e\\-commerce infrastructure company rethinking how digital storefronts are built and scaled.

**What will you work on:** 




 You’ll be leading the development of core platform components used by multiple high\\-growth e\\-commerce brands.
 



 Think: React dashboards, headless storefronts, blazing\\-fast APIs, and cloud\\-native deployment pipelines.
 



 Here’s what your day\\-to\\-day might look like:
 


* Architect full\\-stack features using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node

**What will you bring?** 



* 3\\+ years of full\\-stack development experience with MERN
* 1 year leading or mentoring dev teams (formally or informally)
* Deep comfort with React.js (hooks, routing, state management, SSR)
* Node/Express wizardry — REST APIs, auth, middleware, async flows
* Solid understanding of MongoDB (schema design, queries, indexing)
* Experience with CI/CD, Docker, and deployment workflows
* You care deeply about clean code, testing, and performance
* You’ve shipped real\\-world projects that people actually use



  





**Who we're looking for?** 



* A system thinker who sees both the big picture and low\\-level details
* A builder who’s not afraid to get their hands dirty in unfamiliar code
* Someone who takes ownership, defaults to action, and values clarity
* A pragmatic technologist—knows when to refactor and when to ship
* Bonus: experience with headless CMS, GraphQL, or e\\-commerce infra
