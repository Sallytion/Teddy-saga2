**Full\\-Stack Development** 



* Build production\\-grade front\\-end applications (React, Angular, or similar)
* Develop back\\-end services (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
* Implement authentication, authorization, and role\\-based access
* Integrate cloud\\-native services such as:
* Identity \\& access management
* SMS / email / notification services
* Storage, queues, and messaging systems



  





**Cloud \\& Platform Engineering** 



* Build using AWS or Azure PaaS (serverless, managed services, containers)
* Own deployments, monitoring, logging, and reliability
* Ensure security best practices and production readiness



  





**Leadership \\& Team Building** 



* Mentor and guide fresh engineers and students
* Establish engineering standards, best practices, and documentation
* Participate in hiring and growing the engineering team over time
* Work closely with product, design, and business stakeholders



  





 ​
 **What You Will Get** 



* Competitive compensation

* An exceptional learning curve
* Leadership opportunity from day one
* A chance to build and grow the engineering team
