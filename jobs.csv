 Freelance Project \\| Mobile (iOS / Android) \\| Single Player \\| Family\\-Safe
 



  





 The project allows the use of MIT open source code (commercial license) and temporary placeholder assets from free or paid asset libraries. All work will be performed under a Work for Hire arrangement.
 



  





 Delivery will be in the form of a functional MVP (complete gameplay using placeholders), with later replacement by official Giramille assets.

 About Giramille
 



  





 Giramille is a children’s entertainment studio focused on educational, family\\-friendly, and safe content for kids. We operate our own ad\\-free application featuring games and interactive experiences for children.
 



  





 We are currently developing a new original Giramille game, which will be integrated directly into our existing Unity\\-based application.
 



  





 This document fully describes the technical, creative, and functional scope of the project and serves both as a job description and as a contractual appendix.
 



  





 ⸻
 



  





 Game Overview
 



  





 The project consists of developing a single\\-player arcade\\-style children’s game, designed for kids aged 5 to 8, with a focus on:
 



 • Immediate fun
 



 • Simple controls
 



 • Constant feedback
 



 • Short progression loops
 



 • Zero frustration
 



  





 The game allows the child to choose between different vehicle\\-based modalities, each with three scenarios, competing against AI\\-controlled bots or completing stunt\\-based challenges, depending on the selected modality.
 



  





 ⸻
 



  





 Unified Arena Concept
 



  





 The game takes place within a single, large interactive universe, structured as a giant, living sports arena. This arena acts as the central hub of the game: when a modality is selected, the entire arena dynamically transforms to match the chosen experience.
 



  





 If the child selects a racing mode, the arena becomes a full racetrack; if an aquatic mode is chosen, the arena transforms into a large lake or sea; if snow is selected, the arena becomes a snowy track, and so on. Regardless of the modality, the arena will always feature spectators, cheering crowds, and event\\-style visual elements, reinforcing the feeling of a kid\\-friendly sports spectacle within one cohesive universe.
 



  





 ⸻
 



  





 General Game Structure
 



  





 Game Type
 



 • Single Player
 



 • No multiplayer
 



 • No ads
 



 • No in\\-app purchases
 



 • No use of real\\-world registered brands
 



  





 Core Mechanics
 



 • Simple controls (steering \\+ auto\\-accelerate)
 



 • Arcade physics (not simulation)
 



 • Short sessions (60–120 seconds)
 



 • Constant visual and sound feedback
 



 • Frequent rewards
