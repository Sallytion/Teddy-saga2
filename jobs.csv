****TableauNext Software Engineer****
****Pipeline Operations Engineer****
**About The Position**
**At Salesforce, As a member of our Pipeline Operations team you'll be keeping a watchful eye over the CI/CD pipelines that build and validate Tableau's key products across languages such as Python, Java, C\\+\\+ and JavaScript on Mac, Windows and Linux. Development never stops at Tableau, nor should our pipelines. When problems arise you are quick to spot them and coordinate mitigations to get things back up and running with a minimal level of disruption to our 1200\\+ developers.**
**Responsibilities**
* Monitoring our CI/CD Pipelines. We are continually automating and evolving the tools and processes used to monitor how our pipelines are running. You'll need to keep active watch across various tools and signals to ensure the pipelines are running smoothly allowing our development teams to do their thing.
* Handling branch closures. When problems arise you'll be on point to coordinate the closure of our development branch(es) and keep developers informed of what's happening.
* Triaging and driving defects. We track each and every issue that causes a disruption to our pipelines, some being more disruptive than others. A large part of your role is finding the right team or developer to quickly mitigate issues. Sometimes this is straightforward but can often require coordinating a cross\\-team effort of developers.
* Providing a first line of support to our developers. When developers have issues with code submissions, builds or unexpected test failures, you are there to help them. Don't worry you won't be alone, we have a great team to back you up.
* Deploying qualified builds to the test environments. Once a build is ready, we adhere to a rigorous testing process in both the Test and Stage environments before it goes live in production. Although much of this process is automated, any failures must be investigated and resolved promptly to ensure timely delivery and impress our customers.
* Code integrations. We need to make sure that tested fixes are included in all future releases. You will be responsible for performing code promotions through approved tooling, enabling reliable forward and reverse code integrations across environments.


****Foundational Requirements****
* BA/BS/BTech in Computer Science or a related Engineering degree is highly preferred or equivalent work experience with demonstrated proficiency
* At least 2\\+ years experience in the software development environment.
* Fullstack developer\\-level technical skills along with a strong desire to interact with customers, support teams and management on high\\-profile issues critical to the long\\-term success of the company
* Unparalleled debugging, troubleshooting and problem\\-solving skills
* Learn quickly and be productive in a highly collaborative, lightning\\-fast environment
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, as exemplified by clear bug/issue explanations, documentation of knowledge and comfort interacting with all levels of management
* Ability to take complex problems and break them down into smaller tasks
