* Design and implement end\\-to\\-end QA strategies for applications using Node.js, integrated with LLMs, retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG), and Agentic AI workflows.
* Establish comprehensive benchmarks and quality metrics for GenAI components including accuracy, coherence, relevance, stability, and safety.
* Develop structured evaluation datasheets for LLM behaviour validation: test prompts, expected responses, classification criteria, and scoring rubrics.
* Perform data quality testing for RAG databases and ensure relevant, high\\-quality retrieval to minimize hallucinations and improve grounding.
* Conduct A/B testing across model versions, prompt designs, and system configurations to measure and compare output quality.
* Define methodologies and simulate non\\-deterministic behaviours using Agentic AI testing techniques.
* Collaborate closely with developers, product owners, and AI engineers to test prompt engineering pipelines, function\\-calling interfaces, and fallback logic.
* Build QA automation where applicable and integrate GenAI evaluations into CI/CD pipelines.
* Lead internal capability development by mentoring QA peers on GenAI testing practices and helping evolve the organization’s AI quality maturity.


**Required Skills And Qualifications**
* 6\\+ years of experience in software quality assurance, with at least 3\\+ years working in or around GenAI or LLM\\-based systems.
* Deep understanding of GenAI quality dimensions: response grounding, factual correctness, context awareness, and hallucination minimization.
* Experience creating and maintaining LLM evaluation datasets and designing test cases for dynamic prompt behaviour.
* Hands\\-on experience with tools and techniques for testing retrieval pipelines, embedding quality, and vector similarity results in RAG architectures.
* Familiarity with non\\-deterministic testing strategies, agent loop evaluation, and multi\\-step LLM task validation.
* Comfortable working with APIs, logs, test scripts, and tracing tools to validate both system and AI behaviour.
* Strong analytical thinking and a methodical approach to identifying bugs, regressions, and inconsistencies in AI outputs.
* Bachelor or master’s degree in engineering


**Preferred Skills**
* Experience with GenAI tools/platforms like OpenAI, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, Hugging Face, Pinecone, or Weaviate.
* Exposure to evaluating LLMs in production settings, including safety nets, guardrails, and red\\-teaming approaches.
