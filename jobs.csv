* Work closely with UI/UX designers to turn Figma or Adobe XD concepts into interactive experiences that look perfect down to the pixel.
* Use frameworks like Jest, React Testing Library, or Cypress to do unit testing, integration testing, and E2E testing.

* Experience with Firebase features, including Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Hosting.
* Being good at TypeScript means being able to write code that is strongly typed, reliable, and easy to maintain.
* A deep understanding of how component\\-driven design, state management, and virtual DOM rendering work.
* Knowledge of responsive and adaptive design and the ideas of progressive web apps (PWAs).
* Experience with CI/CD pipelines, automated build processes, and containerised systems (Docker is a bonus).
* Have used code linting and formatting tools like ESLint and Prettier.

 Why You Should Work With Us
 


* Join an IB school that is digitally advanced and values technology and new ideas.
* You can work on web apps that use Next.js and mobile apps that use React Native.
* A place where people work together and are encouraged to write good code and keep learning.
