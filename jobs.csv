 At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.
 



  





 To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.
 



  





 Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.

Our payment solutions are designed with a focus on simplicity and scalability, aiming to drive widespread adoption of crypto\\-centric products such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Decentralized Applications (DApps), and cryptocurrency exchanges.
 



  





 Team is building solutions and services that facilitate the processing of hundreds of billions in payments across 100s of countries worldwide. The movement of funds stands as the central pillar of our operations, encompassing transactions like purchases, sales, deposits, withdrawals, and trades for both retail and institutional clients. Our extensive reach across multiple countries is made possible through our deep integrations with banking systems, credit cards, and digital wallets.
 



  





 As a platform team, we cater not only to our external clientele but also serve our internal customers with equal dedication. In our line of work, each fund transfer is of paramount importance, necessitating consistency and timely execution every single time without fail.
