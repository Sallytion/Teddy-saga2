**Job Description**
 Forbes Advisor is a high\\-growth digital media and technology company dedicated to helping
   

  

 consumers make confident, informed decisions about their money, health, careers, and everyday life.
   

  

 We do this by combining data\\-driven content, rigorous product comparisons, and user\\-first design —
   

  

 all built on top of a modern, scalable platform. Our teams operate globally and bring deep expertise
   

  

 across journalism, product, performance marketing, and analytics.
   

  

 The Role
   

  

 We’re hiring a Data Engineering Lead to help scale and guide a growing team of data engineers. This
   

  

 role is ideal for someone who enjoys solving technical challenges hands\\-on while also shaping
   

  

 engineering best practices, coaching others, and helping cross\\-functional teams deliver data products
   

  

 with clarity and speed.
   

  

 You’ll manage a small team of ICs responsible for building and maintaining pipelines that support
   

  

 reporting, analytics, and machine learning use cases. You’ll be expected to drive engineering excellence
   

  

 — from code quality to deployment hygiene — and play a key role in sprint planning, architectural
   

  

 discussions, and stakeholder collaboration.
   

  

 This is a critical leadership role as our data organization expands to meet growing demand across
   

  

 media performance, optimization, customer insights, and advanced analytics.
   

  

 What you’ll do
   

  

* Lead and grow a team of data engineers working across ETL/ELT, data warehousing,

* Own team delivery across sprints, including planning, prioritization, QA, and


 stakeholder communication
   

  

* Set and enforce strong engineering practices around code reviews, testing, observability,


 and documentation
   

  

* Collaborate cross\\-functionally with Analytics, BI, Revenue Operations, and business


 stakeholders in Marketing and Sales
   

  

* Guide technical architecture decisions for our pipelines on GCP (BigQuery, GCS,


 Composer)
   

  

* Model and transform data using dbt and SQL, supporting reporting, attribution, and


 optimization needs
   

  

* Ensure data security, compliance, and scalability — especially around first\\-party


 customer data
   

  

* Mentor junior engineers through code reviews, pairing, and technical roadmap


 discussions
   

  

 What You Bring
   

  

* 6\\+ years of experience in data engineering, including 2\\+ years of people management or


 formal team leadership
   

  

* Strong technical background with Python, Spark, Kafka, and orchestration tools like


 Airflow
   

  

* Deep experience working in GCP, especially BigQuery, GCS, and Composer
* Strong SQL skills and familiarity with DBT for modeling and documentation
* Clear understanding of data privacy and governance, including how to safely manage


 and segment first\\-party data
