 XBE builds business\\-operations software for heavy\\-materials, logistics, and construction companies that should be generating far more profit than they do today. We operate as a fully remote, high\\-trust team built on ownership, collaboration, and clear outcomes.
 



  





 The role
 



 We are hiring a 
 **Agentic Software Engineer** 
 —a polyglot by outcome, not by syntax. You will use coding agents (e.g., Codex / Claude Code) to generate most implementation, while you own the thinking: problem framing, system design, quality, safety, and delivery.  This is not “prompting.” It is 
 **engineering with leverage** 
 : you direct tools, validate results, and ship work you can stand behind.
 



  





 What you will do (what you own)
 


* Turn ambiguous problems into crisp plans: scope, risks, milestones, acceptance criteria
* Use AI agents to implement across the stack (backend, frontend, infra) as needed
* Establish correctness: tests, guardrails, code review discipline, regression prevention
* Drive reliability: monitoring, incident response, operational fixes, post\\-incident improvements
* Improve delivery speed: better tooling, automation, build/test iteration loops
* Make good tradeoffs: performance, maintainability, cost, and user impact



  





 How we build (AI\\-first, but not careless)
 


* Agents write a lot of code; 
 **humans own outcomes**
* You verify with tests, instrumentation, and runtime behavior—not trust



  





 Ideal profile
 


* Strong engineering fundamentals: debugging, systems thinking, data modeling, APIs
* Comfortable shipping in unfamiliar languages/frameworks with AI assistance
* Excellent at “closing the loop”: reproduce → isolate → fix → validate → prevent recurrence
* Knows how to make agents effective (good specs, constraints, eval criteria, iteration discipline)
* Bias for action, high standards, low ego



  





 What you will get
 


* Work from home, flexible schedule — you manage your own hours; we only expect real\\-time availability during production incidents or time\\-sensitive operational windows
* Stability and long\\-term runway — established, growing company
* High ownership, high trust — clear outcomes, minimal bureaucracy
* Real technical growth — you will level up on architecture, quality, reliability, and AI\\-native workflows
* An AI\\-forward culture — If the AI shift energizes you more than it worries you, you’ll feel at home here.



  





 What success looks like
 


* You ship meaningful improvements quickly without breaking production
* You raise quality via tests, guardrails, and better operational visibility
* You reduce time\\-to\\-resolution during incidents and prevent repeats
* You make the team faster by improving how we use agents and how we validate outputs","Construction","https://www.linkedin.com/company/xbe","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQGACez7nizx4A/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630587604143/xbe_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=jeDhCsMp42ZTfuGB7UftZN4rE-vkJch0MToA3sHvk3w","","","","","","","","","","",""
