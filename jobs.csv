 To successfully apply for this position,
 **filling out this form is mandatory** 
 . Applications without a completed form will
 **not be considered** 
 .
 



  





**Position:** 
 Forward Deployed ML Engineer
 



**Location:** 
 On\\-site
 



**Type:** 
 Full Time
 



  





**About the Role:** 




 As a Forward Deployed ML Engineer, you will build and deploy cutting\\-edge healthcare AI solutions powered by LLMs directly alongside customers and internal stakeholders. You will work end\\-to\\-end from discovery and scoping, to rapid prototyping, to production deployment, owning outcomes in real clinical environments.
 



 Your primary focus will be extracting structured clinical data from unstructured clinical notes and medical documents using RAG, advanced prompting, context engineering, hybrid retrieval, re\\-ranking, and agentic workflows. This is a high\\-ownership, high\\-velocity role where you iterate quickly, ship frequently, and continuously improve accuracy, reliability, and robustness based on real\\-world feedback.
 



 This role is ideal for someone who loves being close to the problem, thrives in ambiguity, and can balance experimentation with strong engineering discipline.
 



  





**What We Expect You to Bring:** 



1. Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science or related field.
2. 2\\+ years of professional experience (or 1\\+ years with an advanced degree) in building and deploying ML/NLP systems.
3. Strong programming skills in Python, with experience building production\\-grade services, APIs, or pipelines.
4. Hands\\-on experience with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, LLaMA, Mistral, etc.) and at least one LLM framework (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack).
5. Strong grasp of prompt engineering and context management (system prompts, few\\-shot examples, retrieval configuration, memory, tool use, etc).
6. Practical experience with RAG pipelines, including embeddings, document chunking, vector databases (FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone, Pgvector), retrieval strategies, and re\\-ranking.
7. Understanding of agentic workflows (LLM agents that can plan, call tools/APIs, and execute multi\\-step tasks).
8. Familiarity with ML/AI fundamentals (transformers, fine\\-tuning, evaluation, error analysis).
9. Comfort working in a fast\\-paced, iterative environment, with strong problem\\-solving skills and a builder mindset.
10. Experience translating messy, real\\-world requirements into practical solutions.
11. Ability to own deliverables end\\-to\\-end (design, prototype, production, monitoring, iteration)



  





**What You Will Be Doing:** 



1. Design and build LLM\\-powered healthcare applications focused on high\\-accuracy extraction of clinical entities, attributes, and relationships from unstructured clinical notes and documents.
2. Integrate and orchestrate open\\-source and proprietary LLM models into robust, production\\-ready systems.
3. Develop end\\-to\\-end RAG pipelines: data ingestion, preprocessing, chunking, indexing, retrieval, re\\-ranking, and response generation.
4. Rapidly prototype solutions in days, validate with real data and users, and evolve prototypes into production\\-quality code.
5. Continuously experiment with and refine prompting strategies and context engineering (system prompts, few\\-shot examples, retrieval configurations, document chunking strategies, hybrid retrieval techniques, smart chain\\-of\\-thought reasoning, and other advanced methods for information extraction from large document collections) to drive measurable gains in extraction accuracy and reliability.
6. Build and refine agentic frameworks using LLMs, enabling AI agents to autonomously query knowledge bases, call tools/APIs, and execute multi\\-step workflows.
7. Define and implement evaluation frameworks (quantitative and qualitative) for LLM\\-based clinical information extraction systems, including hallucination control and safety guardrails.
8. Collaborate closely with clinicians, product managers, and data teams to align solutions with real\\-world clinical workflows and constraints.
9. Ensure data privacy, security, and compliance when working with sensitive healthcare data.
10. Stay up to date with the latest LLM, RAG, and agentic system research, and translate promising ideas into practical prototypes and product features.

 Traditional hiring is broken. In India, startups face a
 **23% candidate no\\-show rate** 
 , massive keyword bias, and high post\\-hire churn.
 **SwipeIt** 
 is the counter\\-thesis to automated HR. We are replacing static CVs with a human\\-centric, video\\-first, hyperlocal hiring surface.
 



**The Role: Architect \\& Partner** 




 We have already validated the core pain points with
 **HRs and founders** 
 and are building a preorder base of
 **500\\+ startups** 
 . I am looking for a Technical Co\\-Founder to take the lead on the
 **Phase 2 build** 
 and turn our validated strategy into a scalable MVP.
 



**Your Immediate Mission (The MVP Build)** 




 You will own the development of our core modules:
 


* **Talent Discovery Engine:** 
 Build dynamic multimedia profiles featuring video pitches, portfolio integration, and automated skill validation scores.
* **The ""Lock\\-in"" \\& Rating Logic:** 
 Architect our proprietary system to discourage job\\-hopping and a reputation layer to solve the industry’s no\\-show crisis.
* **Hyperlocal Matching:** 
 Implement 5\\-10km radius filtering to enable instant, relevant local hiring.
* **The Command Center:** 
 Develop a secure B2B dashboard with ""Kill\\-Switch"" capabilities for organizational oversight.



**Who You Are** 



* **Full\\-Stack Powerhouse:** 
 You can build and deploy a complete app (frontend and backend) from the first line of code.
* **Systems Thinker:** 
 You care about security, scalability, and building a product that solves real\\-world friction.
* **Skin in the Game:** 
 You understand the value of founding equity and want to be a true partner in a venture aimed at transforming India’s digital employment landscape.



**The Deal** 



* **Founding Equity:** 
 This is a co\\-founder role with a significant ownership stake.
* **Validated Strategy:** 
 You aren't guessing what to build. I provide the market research, the preorder base, and the product roadmap.
* **Impact:** 
 We are building a platform that empowers underrepresented candidates and makes hiring affordable for every lean startup.

2. **The Lock\\-In:**
