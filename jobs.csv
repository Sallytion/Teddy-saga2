* Participate actively in code reviews for both frontend and backend code.
* Technical Design \\& Contribution:
* Contribute significantly to technical design and architecture discussions, considering both backend and frontend implications for new features and system improvements.
* Collaborate with principal engineers, product managers, UX/UI designers, and researchers to refine requirements and translate them into effective full\\-stack technical solutions.
* Evaluate and prototype new technologies, algorithms, and frameworks relevant to agentic AI, platform infrastructure, and frontend development.
* Take ownership of the technical implementation for specific features or components spanning the full stack.
* Collaboration \\& Knowledge Sharing:
* Work closely with teammates and cross\\-functional partners (Product, Design, Research, other Engineering teams) to deliver cohesive user experiences and robust backend capabilities.
* Share knowledge, document designs and processes effectively for both backend and frontend aspects.
* May mentor junior engineers on full\\-stack development practices.
* Operational Excellence:
* Troubleshoot and debug complex issues in production environments, potentially spanning frontend, backend, and infrastructure layers.

* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field.
* 5\\+ years of professional full\\-stack software development experience.
* Strong proficiency in one or more backend programming languages such as Python, Javascript/Typescript or Java (Python highly relevant for the AI domain).
* Strong proficiency in frontend technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and modern frontend frameworks (specifically React).
* Hands\\-on experience with agentic AI concepts/frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex), vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate), or RAG techniques.
* Interest in or practical experience with AI/ML concepts, particularly working with or integrating Large Language Models (LLMs).
* Experience building developer tools or interfaces for complex technical products (e.g., AI/ML tooling, data platforms).

* Good communication and collaboration skills, including working with designers.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Experience building platform or infrastructure\\-as\\-a\\-service components.
* Experience with state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand) and frontend build tools (e.g., Webpack, Vite).
* Experience with MLOps practices and tools.
* Experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
* Experience with infrastructure\\-as\\-code (e.g., Terraform).
* Experience optimizing the performance and scalability of both backend distributed systems and frontend applications.

 Django, Celery, Postgres, Docker, Terraform, AWS, Integrating 3rd party APIs, building APIs, Unit \\& Integration testing.
   

  

**We''''''''re Looking For Someone Who Has An End\\-to\\-end Mindset.**
* You can take ownership of a task, propose a solution and plan, involve the right parties, ask the right questions, and can deliver independently if necessary.
* Preferably you''''''''re someone that understands no one person knows everything, and is willing to learn, but also explain and teach others.
