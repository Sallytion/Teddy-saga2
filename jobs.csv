**Location: IIT Madras, Chennai (In\\-Person)** 




**Type: Full\\-Time** 




**The Challenge** 




 RISC\\-V is a nascent Instruction Set Architecture and building for it involves designing hardware and software together. Since building hardware is expensive, a lot of design exploration is performed in software through simulation. We are looking for a sharp Systems Engineer to build detailed, open\\-source simulators that serve as the Golden Models for future silicon. You will be at the intersection of hardware architecture and high\\-performance software engineering, ensuring that our simulators perfectly mirror real\\-world hardware.
 



**What You Will Do** 



* Build and Optimize: Develop and maintain sophisticated simulators (functional and cycle\\-accurate) for the RISC\\-V ISA using C/C\\+\\+.
* Validate: Design and implement validation infrastructure to ensure parity between software models and RTL (Hardware) implementations.
* Explore: Conduct architectural design exploration to evaluate the performance impact of new instructions and features.
* Contribute: Work on open\\-source tools that influence the global RISC\\-V ecosystem.



**What We Are Looking For** 



* Academic Background: MS, MTech, ME, BTech, or BE in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related field with strong systems fundamentals.
* Core Fundamentals: Deep understanding of Computer Architecture (pipelines, memory hierarchy, branch prediction) and Operating Systems.
* Programming Mastery: Excellent C/C\\+\\+ skills are non\\-negotiable. You should be comfortable with low\\-level performance optimization and debugging.
* The X\\-Factor: Prior experience with cycle\\-accurate simulators such as Gem5, Sniper, Spike, or custom engines is a significant advantage.



**Why Join Us at IIT Madras?** 



* Leading Edge: Work at one of the premier hubs for RISC\\-V development in India.
* Impact: Your work will be open\\-sourced, providing high visibility for your contributions in the global semiconductor community.
* Growth: While industrial experience is preferred, we value raw skill and curiosity.
* Competitive Pay: Remuneration is competitive and commensurate with your expertise.
