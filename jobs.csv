* You challenge the existing approach when you see the cliff edge racing towards us, but also get on board once the options have been debated and the team has made a decision
* You're comfortably organised amongst chaos
* You’re a broad thinker and have the capability to see the potential impact of decisions across the wider business


**Technology 🧱**
* We're pragmatic about our technology choices. These are some of the things we use at the moment:
* 🗃 Python
* 🗄️ PostgreSQL, BigQuery, MySQL
* 🎨 TypeScript, React, styled\\-components
* 🔧 Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, pytest
* ☁️ AWS, GCP
* 🚀 ECS Fargate, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions


**How We Expect You To Work 👷‍♀️**
* We expect you to work in these ways, as well as encouraging and enabling these practices from others:
* Collaborate 💬 \\- We work in cross\\-functional, mission driven, autonomous squads that gel over time. We pair program to work better through shared experience and knowledge.
* Focus on outcomes over outputs ✅ \\- Solving a problem for users that translates to business results is our goal. Measurements focused on that goal help us to understand if we are succeeding.
* Practice continuous improvement 💡 \\- We optimise for feedback now, rather than presume what might be needed in the future and introduce complexity before it will be used. This means we learn faster. We share learnings in blame\\-free formats, so that we do not repeat things that have failed, but still have confidence to innovate.
* Seek to understand our users 👂 \\- We constantly seek understanding from data and conversations to better serve our users' needs, taking an active part in research to hear from them directly and regularly.
* Embrace and enable continuous deployment 🤖 \\- Seamless delivery of changes into an environment \\- without manual intervention \\- is essential for us to ensure that we are highly productive; consider resiliency; and practice security by design.
* Test outside\\-in, test first 🚦 \\- TDD keeps us confident in moving fast, and deploying regularly. We want to solve user problems, and so we test with that mindset \\- writing scenarios first, then considering our solution; coupling tests to behaviour, rather than implementation.
* You build it, you run it ⚙️ \\- We embrace DevOps culture and end\\-to\\-end ownership of products and features. Every engineer, regardless of their role, has the opportunity to lead delivery of features from start to finish.
* Be cloud native ☁️ \\- We leverage automation and hosted services to deliver resilient, secure services quickly and consistently. Where SaaS tools help us achieve more productivity and better\\-quality results for a cheap price, we use these to automate low value tasks.


**How We Expect You To Behave ❤️**
* We embrace differences and know that when we can be ourselves at work, we are happier, more motivated, and creative. We want to be able to bring our whole selves to work, have our own perspectives and know that we belong. As such, through your behaviours at work, we expect you to reflect and actively sustain a healthy engineering environment that looks like this:
* A wide range of voices heard to the benefit of all
* Teams that are clearly happy, engaged, and laugh together
* Perceivable safety to have an opinion or ask a question
* No egos \\- people listen to and learn from others at all levels, with strong opinions held loosely


**Benefits \\& Perks 😍**
* Equity. We want people to have a stake in the business so that all our interests are aligned.
* Health Insurance for employee and dependents.
* Wellbeing and social events
* Support causes that matter to you – Volunteering time off


**About Us**
 We’re OakNorth Bank and we embolden entrepreneurs to realise their ambitions, understand their markets, and apply data intelligence to everyday decisions to scale successfully at pace.
   

  

 Banking should be barrier\\-free. It’s a belief at our very core, inspired by our entrepreneurial spirit, driven by the unmet financial needs of millions, and delivered by our data\\-driven tools.
   

  

 And for those who love helping businesses thrive? Our savings accounts help diversify the high street and create new jobs, all while earning savers some of the highest interest on the market.
   

  

 But we go beyond finance, to empower our people, encourage professional growth and create an environment where everyone can thrive. We strive to create an inclusive and diverse workplace where people can be themselves and succeed.
   

  

***Our story***
 OakNorth Bank was built on the foundations of frustrations with old\\-school banking. In 2005, when our founders tried to get capital for their data analytics company, the computer said ‘no’. Unfortunately, all major banks in the UK were using the same computer – and it was broken.
   

  

 Why was it so difficult for a profitable business with impressive cashflow, retained clients, and clear commercial success to get a loan?
   

  

 The industry was backward\\-looking and too focused on historic financials, rather than future potential.
   

  

 So, what if there was a bank, founded by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs? One that offered a dramatically better borrowing experience for businesses?
   

  

 No more what ifs, OakNorth Bank exists.
