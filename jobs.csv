 Solution Architect
   

  

 Solution Architect
   

  

 Pune
   

  

**Role Purpose**
 This is not a standard architect job. As Principal Software Architect (SAFe, Cloud), you will become the principal architect for a real\\-time payments platform that drives daily transactions across Europe, shaping financial lives in real time. This is your opportunity to leave a personal, technical mark within our agile, cross\\-border team, without bureaucracy, and with the trust and freedom to build at scale.
   

  

 At Worldline, you’re not a small piece in a huge apparatus. You will challenge outdated technologies, drive forward our cloud transformation, and architect payment solutions that will be referenced across the industry. You advise, mentor, and enable senior developer, in your team and beyond, while working side by side with leadership at eye\\-level.
   

  

 If you are ambitious and feel underchallenged or too system\\-limited in your current role, this role will put you to the test every day: architecting, decision making, and directly shaping the next generation of European payments with visible, international impact.
   

  

**Your Key Responsibilities**
* Map, document, and continuously evolve our software landscape using ArchiMate (operated via Enterprise Architect toolkit or ArchiMate community tools)
* Technically lead, coach and inspire cross\\-functional development teams on architecture and design level; deep\\-dive in code \\& patterns when needed
* Own and build robust, automated CI/CD pipelines (GitLab) in strong collaboration with global DevOps, and relentlessly push for automation—even “against the odds”
* Be the go\\-to partner and peer for senior engineering, ensuring technical mentoring, upskilling and a collaborative, learning culture
* Enable and evolve our cloud migration journey (k8s/Docker, preferably Own Cloud \\& AWS; legacy Oracle DB, moving to PostgreSQL; strong focus on reliability \\& security)
* Support further software development projects—they are independent, yet strategic, requiring sound decision\\-making in ambiguous, rapidly changing environments
* Closely collaborate and communicate with European stakeholders (developers, operations, business, regulatory) at all levels and across cultures—acting with awareness, clarity, and respect
* If interested and suitable, personnel responsibility for developers can be optionally taken on; not a must, the pure technical lead role is welcome


**Your Profile**
* Senior software architect in complex, mission\\-critical backend/service worlds (Java, at enterprise/payment\\-scheme grade)
* Excellent methodological knowledge of modern architectures, proven with cloud\\-native/DevOps stack and CI/CD (Kubernetes, Docker, GitLab, Terraform, SonarQube, AWS/OwnCloud, PostgreSQL; AMQ, Grafana, Angular a plus)
* Trusted leadership and “tech mentor” qualities: respected as architect and senior engineer, shaping the daily work in code and concept
* High intercultural competence, distinct European communication “flair”—confidence giving/receiving open, direct, constructive feedback
* SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) certification, experience or strong proven knowledge in leading/architecting products in regulated, agile organizations
* Enterprise Architect proficiency and/or substantial experience with ArchiMate (alternative tooling welcome, approach is crucial)
* Native or near\\-native fluency in English (C2\\); Clear, idiomatic, and accent\\-free communication


**What We Offer**
* Permanent position with strong ownership/responsibility; visible impact at scale
* Technically challenging, cutting\\-edge environment and international project setup
* Support for personal growth—horizontal career (technical ladder), leadership and mentoring opportunities
* Hybrid and remote flexibility; base location Pune or Bengaluru
* An empowering and trust\\-based feedback culture with open doors and minimal hierarchy At Worldline, we believe that embracing diversity and promoting inclusion drive innovation and success. We foster a workplace where everyone feels valued and empowered to bring their authentic selves. Through extensive training, mentorship, and development programs, we support your growth and help you make a meaningful impact.


 Join a global team of passionate professionals shaping the future of payments technology—where your ideas, experiences, and perspectives are appreciated and celebrated.
