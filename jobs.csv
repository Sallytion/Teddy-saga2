 You are not involved in writing PRDs, breaking tasks, or deciding architecture.
 



 Your role begins after development starts.
 



 Whenever an AI Engineer hits a blocker, logic confusion, implementation difficulty, PRD misinterpretation, code errors, environment issues, you step in immediately with rapid diagnosis and an LLM\\-powered solution.
 



 Your job is to ensure engineers never get stuck, maintain full clarity, and continue executing exactly as per the plan.
 



 In simple words: You keep the engineering engine running at full speed, every day.
 



  





**What You Will Do** 




 • Own the daily engineering velocity by ensuring every developer moves without blockers, confusion, or delays.
 



 • Continuously monitor progress and intervene the moment a slowdown, doubt, or issue appears.
 



 • Diagnose problems instantly using Cursor, LLM reasoning frameworks, and our internal Troubleshooting Playbook.
 



 • Provide fast, precise solutions — whether it’s logic correction, implementation guidance, code\\-level debugging, or alternative approaches.
 



 • Maintain absolute clarity across engineering by eliminating misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and incorrect assumptions.
 



 • Apply our Cursor\\-First Zero\\-Blocker Method to resolve PRD logic gaps, workflow issues, and technical blockers.
 



 • Track and escalate dependencies with urgency, ensuring access, environment, or configuration issues are closed within SLA.
 



 • Enforce predictable daily output by keeping every engineer aligned, unblocked, and progressing according to plan.
 



 • Act as the velocity guardian of the Pod — ensuring fast decision\\-making, smooth execution, and consistent delivery momentum.
 



  





**What We’re Looking For** 




 • 3–5 years of experience in software engineering / solution engineering / technical problem\\-solving roles.
 



 • Strong ability to understand logic, architecture, and workflows quickly.
 



 • Excellent at debugging, reasoning, and breaking down complex problems.
 



 • Hands\\-on experience using LLM tools (ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude, etc.) as a force\\-multiplier for rapid problem resolution.
 



 • Ability to communicate clearly and simplify complex concepts for engineers.
 



 • A mindset trained for high\\-velocity engineering — urgency, precision, and no tolerance for delay or ambiguity.
 



 • High integrity, disciplined work ethic, and strong accountability — someone who owns outcomes, not just tasks.
 



 • A natural problem\\-solver who enjoys unblocking teams, restoring flow, and maintaining execution speed.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/xerago","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFKU-oSln-PIg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1706686386765/xerago_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=yWIFCC7qKw7kOjVB8TMJNDBAEIvAW2cagAErtpSnEr8","","","","","","","","","","",""
