* Implement automated retraining (scheduling/triggers, validation, versioning, rollout)
* Scale GenAI\\-enabled solutions so multiple customers can use them safely and reliably, with multi\\-tenant controls, guardrails, evaluation, and tuning
* Set up model observability: performance metrics, drift detection, data quality checks, alerting, and production troubleshooting
* Partner with engineering and platform teams to integrate solutions into production and CI/CD workflows


**Requirements**
* 5\\+ years overall experience in AI/ML engineering, including 2\\+ years with GenAI/LLM systems
* Strong proficiency in Python for model development, automation, and production\\-grade services

* Working knowledge of scalable service design (latency/cost optimization, caching, batching, rate limiting)
* Experience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch or TensorFlow) is a plus


 Strong communication skills and ability to work effectively in a collaborative environment.
