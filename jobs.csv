 You will contribute directly to building automation\\-first frameworks, integrating test packs into CI/CD pipelines, and enabling functional and non\\-functional coverage that ensures our products meet the highest standards of performance, security, and scalability. Working alongside domain experts in energy, marine, manufacturing, and operational excellence, your role will help transform industrial operations globally.
   

  

 At PADI QE COE, your work is not just about testing — it’s about enabling industries to operate smarter, safer, and more sustainably.

 the model learns to propose, critique, and improve code the way
 *you* 
 do.



  





**RLHF in one line** 




 Generate code ➜ expert engineers rank, edit, and justify ➜ convert that feedback into reward signals ➜ reinforcement learning tunes the model toward code you’d actually ship.
 



 What You’ll Need
 


* **3\\+ years of professional software engineering experience** 
 in
 **Python**
* (Constraint programming experience is a bonus, but not required)
* **Strong code\\-review instincts** 
 —you can spot logic errors, performance traps, and security issues quickly.
* **Extreme attention to detail and excellent written communication skills.**
* Much of this role involves explaining
 *why* 
 one approach is better than another. This cannot be overstated.
* You
 **enjoy reading documentation and language specs** 
 and thrive in an asynchronous, low\\-oversight environment.



  





**What You Don’t Need** 



* No prior RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) or AI training experience.
* No deep machine learning knowledge. If you can review and critique code clearly, we’ll teach you the rest.



  





**Tech Stack** 




 We are looking for engineers with a strong command of
 **Python** 
 .
 



  





**Logistics** 



* **Location:** 
 Fully remote — work from anywhere
* **Compensation:** 
 From $30/hr to $70/hr, depending on location and seniority
* **Hours:** 
 Minimum 15 hrs/week, up to 40 hrs/week available
* **Engagement:** 
 1099 contract
