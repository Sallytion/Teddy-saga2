**Krimatix** 
  is a metadata\\-driven platform where workflows, validations, permissions, and user experiences are dynamically generated from configuration and JSON metadata. Quality in this environment requires strong test design, disciplined manual validation, and automation that adapts as the platform and metadata evolve.
 



  





 He will own quality end\\-to\\-end across manual and automated testing. This role defines test strategy, creates test plans and suites, executes exploratory and manual testing, and builds reliable automated coverage across UI, API, contracts, performance and load, security boundaries, and accessibility. The role also implements CI/CD quality gates in Azure DevOps to ensure releases meet clear entry and exit criteria.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities:** 




**Test Strategy, Planning, and Test Design** 




  





 • Define and maintain test strategy for assigned platform capabilities and modules using a risk\\-based approach.
 



 • Create test plans that include scope, approach, environments, test data strategy, entry and exit criteria, and release risks.
 



 • Design and maintain test suites for smoke, regression, integration, end\\-to\\-end, negative, and exploratory testing.
 



 • Establish traceability between requirements, user stories, test cases, automation coverage, and defects.
 



 • Track and report quality metrics such as coverage, defect escape rate, flakiness, and time to feedback.
 



  





**Manual Testing and Exploratory Validation** 




  





 • Author high\\-quality manual test cases for complex workflows, edge cases, and usability validation.
 



 • Execute exploratory testing to identify failure modes that scripted tests do not catch.
 



 • Provide release readiness summaries including what was tested, known issues, residual risk, and recommendations.
 



  





**Metadata\\-Driven Platform Validation** 




  





 • Validate dynamic UI generation, conditional logic, computed fields, workflow branching, feature flags, and configuration\\-driven behavior.
 



 • Verify metadata correctness through schema validation, versioning, backward compatibility, and migration testing.
 



 • Validate RBAC and multitenancy boundaries, including authorization negative testing and tenant data isolation.
 



  





**Automation Engineering** 




  





 • Build maintainable automation in TypeScript and Node.js using strong patterns such as fixtures, helpers, and reusable utilities.
 



 • Implement UI and end\\-to\\-end automation using Playwright, including evidence capture (traces, screenshots, video) and cross\\-browser coverage.
 



 • Reduce flakiness through deterministic test data, stable selectors, isolation, environment controls, and disciplined retry usage.
 



  





**API, Contract, and Integration Validation** 




  





 • Implement API functional and negative tests for REST and/or GraphQL services.
 



 • Enforce API compatibility through consumer\\-driven contract testing and OpenAPI validation in CI.
 



 • Use mocking and service virtualization to keep tests deterministic and isolate failures.
 



  





**Non\\-Functional Testing** 




 • Build performance and load tests with defined thresholds and repeatable CI execution.
 



 • Integrate security scanning and targeted boundary tests focused on RBAC enforcement, tenant isolation, and secure handling of inputs.
 



 • Add baseline accessibility checks for key journeys and high\\-traffic experiences.
 



  





**CI/CD Quality Gates (Azure DevOps)** 




  





 • Integrate test execution into Azure DevOps pipelines with stage\\-appropriate suites and promotion\\-blocking quality gates.
 



 • Publish test results and artifacts, support fast triage, and drive improvements in pipeline signal and stability.
 



  





**Required Qualifications** 




  





 • Above 6\\+ years of experience in QA and/or SDET roles with ownership across manual and automation testing.
 



 • Demonstrated strength in writing test plans, test cases, and comprehensive test suites for complex systems.
 



 • Strong debugging, root cause analysis, and communication skills.
 



  





**Preferred Qualifications** 




  





 • Experience testing metadata\\-driven or highly configurable platforms (dynamic forms, workflow engines, rules engines, low\\-code platforms).
 



 • Contract testing experience with Pact (Pact JS) and a contract broker (PactFlow or equivalent).
 



 • Performance and load testing experience with k6 (or similar tools such as JMeter or Locust).
 



 • Security testing familiarity, including OWASP ZAP baseline and API scanning.
 



 • Accessibility automation experience using axe\\-core.
 



 • Experience with Docker\\-based test environments, deterministic test data seeding, and environment reset strategies.
 



 • Proven experience reducing flaky tests and improving CI signal.
 



  





**Krimatix Testing Technology Stack** 




  





 •
 **UI and End\\-to\\-End:** 
  Playwright (TypeScript, Node.js)
 



 •
 **API Functional:** 
  Playwright APIRequestContext, Supertest
 



 •
 **Contract Testing:** 
  Pact (Pact JS) with broker
 



 •
 **Schema Validation:** 
  OpenAPI validation in CI, AJV for JSON Schema validation (metadata and configuration)
 



 •
 **Performance and Load:** 
  k6 with CI thresholds
 



 •
 **Security Scanning:** 
  OWASP ZAP baseline and API scanning
 



 •
 **Accessibility:** 
  axe\\-core integrated into automated flows
 



 •
 **Mocking:** 
  MSW (Mock Service Worker) for deterministic scenarios
 



 •
 **Environment and CI/CD:** 
  Docker, Azure DevOps Pipelines, Git
 



  





**What Success Looks Like** 




  





 • Releases ship with high confidence supported by clear plans, strong manual coverage, and trusted automation.
 



 • Automation is stable, fast, and actionable with low flakiness and clear diagnostics.
 



 • Metadata and configuration changes do not silently break platform behavior because schema, contract, and dynamic UI tests catch regressions early.
 



 • Production escapes trend down over time through improved test design, risk coverage, and effective quality gates.
