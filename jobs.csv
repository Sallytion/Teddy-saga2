In order to accomplish this, we use state\\-of\\-the\\-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Aerospike, and agile development practices.

* Constantly look for ways to improve our products, code\\-base and development practices
* Write great code and help others write great code
* Drive Technical decisions in the organization.


**What You’ll Need To Succeed**
* 7\\+ years’ experience under your belt developing performance\\-critical applications that run in a production environment using Scala, Java or C\\#.
* Experience in leading projects, initiatives and/or teams, with full ownership of the systems involved
* Data platforms like SQL, Cassandra or Hadoop. You understand that different applications have different data requirements
* Good understanding of algorithms and data structures
* Strong coding ability
* You are passionate about the craft of software development and constantly work to improve your knowledge and skills
* Excellent verbal and written English communication skills


**It’s Great If You Have**
* Experience with Scrum/Agile development methodologies
* Experience building large\\-scale distributed products
* Core engineering infrastructure tools like Git for source control, TeamCity for Continuous Integration and Puppet for deployment
* Hands\\-on experience working with technology like queueing systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, MSMQ), Spark, Hadoop, NoSQL (Cassandra, MongoDB), Play framework, Akka library
