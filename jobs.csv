**ABOUT SENDORA AI:** 




 Sendora is the first
 **Agentic AI Revenue Infrastructure** 
 — a scaling partner for high\\-output B2B teams.
 



 We build autonomous outbound sales engines that run across LinkedIn, email, SMS, and voice. Our multi\\-agent AI systems coordinate like full SDR teams — researching prospects, personalizing outreach, handling replies, and booking meetings — while improving themselves every 48–72 hours through reinforcement learning.
 



 Clients work with us not for dashboards or templates, but for a living AI infrastructure that thinks, learns, and scales with them. We have generated more than $5M in pipeline and saved clients thousands of SDR hours by building AI systems that operate continuously.

 – Develop intuitive UIs and dashboards that make complex AI\\-driven workflows simple and accessible.
 



 – Translate sales strategies into robust, automated pipelines that run across multiple channels.
 



 – Iterate rapidly using AI\\-first development tools and methodologies (Cursor, Copilot, v0\\.dev, etc.).
 



 – Own features end\\-to\\-end, from architecture and design through testing, deployment, and optimization.
 



  





**YOU'RE A STRONG FIT IF YOU:** 




 – Have built and shipped
 **real n8n workflows at scale** 
 , not just small demos.
 



 – Can debug, optimize, and extend automation infrastructure under real\\-world conditions.
 



 – Use AI tools daily as part of your development process and treat them as core accelerators.
 



 – Have experience with full\\-stack development in modern JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks.
 



 – Are skilled at connecting APIs, managing authentication, and handling complex data flows.
 



 – Move quickly, adapt to new requirements, and are comfortable owning outcomes.
 



  





**WHAT WE OFFER:** 




 – A full\\-time position with equity participation.
 



 – An AI\\-first culture where we run on the same infrastructure we deliver to clients.
 



 – Direct influence on product evolution, client impact, and company growth.
 



 – Remote\\-friendly structure with flexible working hours.
