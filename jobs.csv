 Chargebee’s GBT AI team builds internal AI agents and workflows that power smarter, faster operations across Finance, HR, Legal , Marketing, RevOps and GTM. We’re looking for an AI Engineer who can think end\\-to\\-end—understand the business process, design the right solution (not just an out\\-of\\-the\\-box tool), and ship robust agentic systems that deliver measurable impact.
 



  





**What you’ll do** 



* **Design, build, and ship AI agents** 
 that automate internal workflows (e.g., case triage, knowledge assistants, data reconciliation, summarization, entity extraction, task orchestration).
* **Own the full lifecycle**

 solutions with offline tests, golden sets, guardrails, and observability; drive down hallucinations and failure modes.
* **Document clearly** 
 and partner with stakeholders to align on success criteria, SLAs, and ongoing maintenance.
* **(Nice\\-to\\-have ML)** 
 : apply ML where it adds value—basic classifiers/embeddings, light fine\\-tuning/adapters, feature work, and A/B evaluation.

**2\\-6 years of professional software experience** 
 , including hands\\-on delivery of at least one AI agent or workflow in production or a serious pilot.

 and/or
 **Anthropic (Claude)** 
 (or comparable model APIs) to build real features.
* Strong coding in
 **Python or TypeScript** 
 , with sound software engineering practices (testing, code reviews, CI/CD, Git Best Practices).
* Working knowledge of
 **prompt design** 
 ,
 **function/tool calling** 
 ,
 **RAG** 
 (vector stores, chunking, indexing), and
 **pipeline orchestration** 
 .
* Comfort with
 **HTTP APIs** 
 , authentication, and integrating multiple systems into a coherent solution.
* Experience in developing, debugging and optimizing data pipelines and transformations using
 **Python/Pandas/SQL.**
* Experience working with at least one no\\-code or low\\-code agentic workflow automation tool such as n8n, Zapier, or OpenAI Agent Builder.



  





**Nice to have** 



* Experience with
 **LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel** 
 , or similar agent frameworks.
* Observability/eval tools (e.g.,
 **LangSmith, Phoenix/Arize, Weights \\& Biases** 
 , OpenTelemetry).
* Vector databases (
 **Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector,etc** 
 ) and data systems (SQL, dbt, warehouse basics).
* Knowledge of
 **ML fundamentals** 
 (classification,forecasting, embeddings, evaluation)
* Security \\& compliance awareness (PII handling, access controls, red\\-team/guardrails).
* SaaS/B2B domain familiarity; subscription billing/revenue ops context is a plus.
* Experience working with major cloud technologies (AWS, Azure, or GCP)

* Bias to
 **automation \\+ ownership** 
 : you’ll take features from discovery → design → deployment.
* Model\\-agnostic approach: choose the
 **right tool/model** 
 for quality, latency, and cost.

 This is not just a management role. You’ll be hands\\-on in C\\+\\+ and Unreal, shipping real features, while also mentoring younger engineers and defining our AI integration strategy. You’ll get to experiment, fail fast, and scale what works with the freedom to shape both the technical vision and the creative impact of AI in game development.
   

  

 What You’ll Do
   

  

* Build \\& Integrate AI Tools → Design and implement AI\\-driven systems across art, design, and engineering workflows.
