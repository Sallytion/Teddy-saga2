 Turing is seeking experienced C/C\\+\\+ developers to partner with a leading AI research lab in validating and improving AI\\-generated code. In this role, you’ll review and correct complex systems code, enforce best practices, and guide how AI integrates with production\\-quality C/C\\+\\+ applications.
 



 This is a fully remote, highly flexible engagement — work from anywhere, on your own schedule.
 



  





**What You’ll Do:** 



* Review and validate AI\\-generated C/C\\+\\+ code for correctness, reliability, and performance.
* Debug complex runtime issues and propose scalable fixes and patterns.
* Contribute to improving AI evaluation workflows and coding standards.
* Collaborate with AI researchers and engineers to refine code\\-generation quality.



  





**What We’re Looking For:** 



* Strong professional experience with modern C/C\\+\\+ (toolchains, build systems, debugging, performance optimization).
* Proven ability to improve and maintain large, complex codebases.
* Familiarity with AI\\-assisted code generation or evaluation workflows (nice to have).
* Excellent problem\\-solving skills and clear communication in English.



  





**Why You'll Love This Role:** 



* Remote \\& Flexible → Work from anywhere, on your schedule.
* Career Edge → Build experience at the intersection of C/C\\+\\+ and AI.
