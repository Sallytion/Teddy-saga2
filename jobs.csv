 At Tide, we are building a business management platform designed to save small businesses time and money. We provide our members with business accounts and related banking services, but also a comprehensive set of connected administrative solutions from invoicing to accounting.
   

  

 Launched in 2017, Tide is now used by over
 **1 million small businesses** 
 across the world and is available to UK, Indian and German SMEs. Headquartered in central London, with offices in Sofia, Hyderabad, Delhi, Berlin and Belgrade, Tide employs over 2,000 employees.
   

  

 Tide is rapidly growing, expanding into new products and markets and always looking for passionate and driven people. Join us in our mission to empower small businesses and help them save time and money.
   

  

**About The Team**
 Our 40\\+ engineering teams are working on designing, creating and running the rich product catalogue across our business areas (e.g. Payments Services, Business Services). We have a long roadmap ahead of us and always have interesting problems to tackle. We trust and empower our engineers to make real technical decisions that affect multiple teams and shape the future of Tide’s Global One Platform. It’s an exceptional opportunity to make a real difference by taking ownership of engineering practices in a rapidly expanding company!
   

  

 We work in small autonomous teams, grouped under common domains owning the full lifecycle of some microservices in Tide’s service catalogue. Our engineers self\\-organize, gather together to discuss technical challenges, and set their own guidelines in the different
 **Communities of Practice** 
 regardless of where they currently stand in our Growth Framework.
   

  

**About The Role**
* Contribute to our event\\-driven Microservice Architecture (currently 200\\+ services owned by 40\\+ teams). You will define and maintain the services your team owns (you design it, you build it, you run it, you scale it globally)
* Use Java 17, Spring Boot and JOOQ to build your services.
* Expose and consume RESTful APIs. We value good API design and we treat our APIs as Products (in the world of Open Banking often times they are gonna be public!)
* Use SNS\\+SQS and Kafka to send events
* Utilise PostgreSQL via Aurora as your primary datastore (we are heavy AWS users)
* Deploy your services to Production as often as you need to (this usually means multiple times per day!). This is enabled by our CI/CD pipelines powered by GitHub with GitHub actions, and solid JUnit/Pact testing (new joiners are encouraged to have something deployed to production in their first 2 weeks)
* Experience modern GitOps using ArgoCD. Our Cloud team uses Docker, Terraform, EKS/Kubernetes to run the platform.
* Have DataDog as your best friend to monitor your services and investigate issues
* Collaborate closely with Product Owners to understand our Users’ needs, Business opportunities and Regulatory requirements and translate them into well\\-engineered solutions


**What We Are Looking For**
* Have some experience building server\\-side applications and detailed knowledge of the relevant programming languages for your stack. You don’t need to know Java, but bear in mind that most of our services are written in Java, so you need to be willing to learn it when you have to change something there!
* Have a sound knowledge of a backend framework (e.g. Spring/Spring Boot) that you’ve used to write microservices that expose and consume RESTful APIs
* Have experience engineering scalable and reliable solutions in a cloud\\-native environment (the most important thing for us is understanding the fundamentals of CI/CD, practical Agile so to speak)
* Demonstrate a mindset of delivering secure, well\\-tested and well\\-documented software that integrates with various third party providers and partners (we do that a lot in the fintech industry)


**Our Tech Stack**
* Java 17, Spring Boot and JOOQ to build the RESTful APIs of our microservices
* Event\\-driven architecture with messages over SNS\\+SQS and Kafka to make them reliable
* Primary datastores are MySQL and PostgreSQL via RDS or Aurora (we are heavy AWS users)
* Docker, Terraform, EKS/Kubernetes used by the Cloud team to run the platform
* DataDog, ElasticSearch/Fluentd/Kibana and Rollbar to keep it running
* GitHub with GitHub actions for Sonarcloud, Snyk and solid JUnit/Pact testing to power the CI/CD pipelines


**What You Will Get In Return**
* Competitive salary
* Self \\& Family Health Insurance
* Term \\& Life Insurance
* OPD Benefits
* Mental wellbeing through Plumm
* Learning \\& Development Budget
* WFH Setup allowance
* 25 Annual leaves
* Family \\& Friendly Leaves

**About Sitetracker**
 Sitetracker was founded ten years ago with the singular focus of solving a problem that was first recognized within the telecommunications industry; how to effectively manage the volume, variety, and velocity of critical infrastructure projects needed to meet the demand of expanding wireless and cellular service. That problem has become even more pronounced due to the eventual explosion of 5G. Being able to effectively deploy infrastructure is going to be the differentiator between leading telecommunication providers.
   

  

 However, over the years, we realized that this challenge isn’t localized to telecommunications – it’s pervasive nearly everywhere and has reached an inflection point. Utilities (such as gas and electric services), smart cities, and alternative energy all face similar challenges. Sitetracker is the only full\\-lifecycle project management platform suited to support these companies and address these challenges.
   

  

 We are exceptionally proud of the company we’ve built (we were recently recognized as the \\#2 place to work in San Francisco, as well as one of the top places to work in the entire United States). Our people are extraordinary and we’re continuing to invest in our people\\-first culture.","Software Development and IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/sitetracker","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQGc32DDsZv3tg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1654642587392/sitetracker_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0P62jdqhEGTY_DksZCElhWHK7TuGhfT8SsXfDbKm6Qo","","","","","","","","","","",""

**About the Role** 




  





  





 As a
 *Forward Deployed ML Engineer* 
 , you’ll sit at the intersection of research and deployment: turning notebooks into containerised microservices, wiring up ML inference pipelines, and making sure they run reliably in demanding industrial environments. This role is not just about training models. You’ll write PyTorch code when needed, package models into Docker containers, design message\\-brokered microservice architectures, and deploy them in hybrid on\\-prem/cloud setups. You’ll also be customer\\-facing: working with process engineers and operators to integrate Orbital into their workflows.
 



  





  





**Responsibilities** 




  





  




* **Model Integration \\& Engineering**
* Take research models (time\\-series, deep learning, physics\\-informed) and productionise them in PyTorch.
* Wrap models into containerised services (Docker/Kubernetes) with clear APIs.
* Optimise inference pipelines for latency, throughput, and reliability.
* 
* **Microservices \\& Messaging**
* Design and implement ML pipelines as multi\\-container microservices.
* Use message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.) to orchestrate data flow between services.
* Ensure pipelines are fault\\-tolerant and scalable across environments.
* 
* **Forward Deployment \\& Customer Integration**
* Deploy AI services into customer on\\-prem environments (industrial networks, restricted clouds).
* Work with customer IT/OT teams to integrate with historians, OPC UA servers, and real\\-time data feeds.
* Debug, monitor, and tune systems in the field — ensuring AI services survive messy real\\-world data.
* 
* **Software Engineering Best Practices**
* Maintain clean, testable, container\\-ready codebases.
* Implement CI/CD pipelines for model deployment and updates.
* Work closely with product and data engineering teams to align system interfaces.

* Ability to work in forward\\-deployed settings, collaborating directly with customers.



  









**Preferred Skills** 




  





  




* What Success Looks Like
* Research models are hardened into fast, reliable services that run in production.

**Equal Opportunity Statement** 




  





  





 We are building the world’s first industrial AI foundation model with Orbital — applied directly inside energy operations. You’ll work on real\\-world problems with massive impact: optimising refineries, reducing emissions, and transforming industrial decision\\-making. Our team blends deep AI research, industrial domain expertise, and hands\\-on engineering, giving you a unique platform to learn and grow. We’re still small enough that your models, pipelines, and deployments directly shape the product. If you want to be at the intersection of AI, energy, and real\\-time systems, this is where it happens.
