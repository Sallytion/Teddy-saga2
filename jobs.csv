 Collaboration\\-Driven: You thrive in a cross\\-functional team environment, working closely with developers, product managers, and operations teams to ensure alignment on requirements and testing goals. You communicate effectively, advocate for quality throughout the development process, and proactively address potential issues before they arise, fostering a culture of shared responsibility for delivering exceptional software.
   

  

 Data driven: We are a data rich business with :15,000 small customers. Each decision we make can impact many more people than we realise \\- so it's critical that we use sound data to support our strategies and review the success of our initiatives.
   

  

 Can have tough conversations in a positive way: It's not a matter of if, but when difficult interpersonal situations arise. Disagreement, conflict and disappointment are a given in a fast moving business where people care about their work. People that proactively have tough conversations with kindness build empathy, trust and great working relationships.
