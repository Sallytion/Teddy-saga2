 Help train large\\-language models (LLMs) to write production\\-grade code across a wide range of programming languages:
 


* **Compare \\& rank multiple code snippets** 
 , explaining which is best and why.
* **Repair \\& refactor AI\\-generated code** 
 for correctness, efficiency, and style.
* **Inject feedback** 
 (ratings, edits, test results) into the RLHF pipeline and keep it running smoothly.
* **End result:** 
 the model learns to propose, critique, and improve code the way
 *you* 
 do.



  





**RLHF in one line** 




 Generate code ➜ expert engineers rank, edit, and justify ➜ convert that feedback into reward signals ➜ reinforcement learning tunes the model toward code you’d actually ship.
 



  





**What You’ll Need** 



* **3\\+ years of professional software engineering experience** 
 in
 **Ruby**
* (Constraint programming experience is a bonus, but not required)
* **Strong code\\-review instincts** 
 —you can spot logic errors, performance traps, and security issues quickly.
* **Extreme attention to detail and excellent written communication skills.**
* Much of this role involves explaining
 *why* 
 one approach is better than another. This cannot be overstated.
* You
 **enjoy reading documentation and language specs** 
 and thrive in an asynchronous, low\\-oversight environment.



  





**What You Don’t Need** 



* No prior RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) or AI training experience.
* No deep machine learning knowledge. If you can review and critique code clearly, we’ll teach you the rest.
