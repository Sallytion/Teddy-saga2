* **Mechanical Mastery:** 
 Expert\\-level 3D CAD (SolidWorks/Autodesk Inventor). Deep knowledge of pneumatics, actuators, and precision machining.
* **Electrical Fluency:** 
 Ability to create professional wiring schematics and select appropriate electrical components (MCBs, SMPS, Relays, VFDs, and I/O modules).
* **The ""Mechatronics"" Mindset:** 
 You understand how electrical noise impacts sensitive sensors and how mechanical heat affects electronics.
* **Education:** 
 B.E./B.Tech in Mechatronics, Mechanical, or Electrical Engineering.


**Why Spookfish?** 
* **True Ownership:** 
 You own the machine from the first sketch to the final power\\-on.

 You will join a highly skilled Enterprise Technology team passionate about building and safeguarding the identity and certificate management platforms that form the backbone of our digital trust strategy. This is a collaborative environment where engineers, architects, and product owners work side by side to deliver secure, resilient, and innovative solutions at scale.
   

  

 You will partner with a broad set of collaborators, including Identity \\& Access Management, Information Security, DevOps, Cloud Platform, Application Development, and Compliance teams, as well as senior business leaders who rely on these critical services. Close collaboration with cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and vendor partners will also be a key part of the role.
   

  

 What makes this team outstanding is its culture of trust, innovation, and continuous learning. We embrace automation, modern engineering practices, and forward\\-looking cryptographic strategies to stay ahead of evolving threats. You’ll be part of a team that values technical perfection, visibility, and knowledge sharing—where every engineer has a voice in shaping the future of enterprise security.
   

  

**Let Me Tell You About The Role**
 Join us to improve our digital trust as our Staff Enterprise Technology Engineer for Certificate and Identity Management. You'll build and evolve the critical foundation on which our entire digital ecosystem depends—the cornerstone authentication platform that enables all other services to operate securely. Blending deep security expertise with strategic vision, you'll transform our identity infrastructure from traditional PKI to quantum\\-resistant solutions while ensuring enterprise\\-wide resilience. You will also play a key role in evolving how we lead, automate, and secure our directory infrastructure, including Active Directory (AD), Entra ID (AAD), and related identity platforms.
   

  

 As a key member of this team, you will be a guardian of this operationally critical platform, you'll engineer a dynamic platform that continuously evolves while supporting innovation across all business functions. Working with senior leadership, you'll drive automation initiatives and establish security frameworks that safeguard our critical applications. Build the future of machine identity in the quantum age, knowing that your work forms the crucial bedrock of trust for everything we build.
