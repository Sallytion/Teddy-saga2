 **Senior Frontend Engineer** 
 to help design and build sophisticated, data heavy user interfaces for our Integration Cloud. This role focuses on translating complex domain concepts—such as system configurations, data flows, and operational states—into intuitive, performant, and highly interactive web experiences.
   

  

 This is a hands\\-on senior engineering role with deep ownership of frontend architecture, interactive UI development, and
 **explicit responsibility for frontend and end\\-to\\-end test coverage** 
 . You will work primarily in
 **React and TypeScript** 
 , contribute to a shared design system, and build advanced diagrammatic and SVG\\-based interfaces.
   

  

 This is not a “UI\\-only” position. We are looking for an engineer with strong judgment, systems thinking, and a commitment to frontend quality, correctness, and long\\-term maintainability.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
**Frontend Architecture \\& Development**
* Design, build, and maintain complex frontend applications using React and TypeScript.
* Develop and evolve a component\\-based architecture aligned with our internal design system (TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui).
* Translate high\\-fidelity designs into polished, production\\-ready interfaces.
* Ensure frontend codebases remain scalable, maintainable, and well\\-structured as the platform grows.


**Interactive \\& Visual UI Engineering**
* Build highly interactive, visual interfaces using diagramming and graph libraries such as ReactFlow, JointJS, D3, or similar.
* Work directly with SVG primitives to implement custom visuals, connectors, and interactions.
* Implement performant pan/zoom, drag\\-and\\-drop, selection, and layout behaviors.
* Make informed trade\\-offs between leveraging third\\-party libraries and implementing custom rendering logic.


**Testing, Quality \\& Reliability (Core Responsibility)**
* Write and maintain unit, integration, and end\\-to\\-end tests for frontend features.
* Own UI test strategy and coverage for assigned product areas and critical user flows.
* Use modern testing frameworks such as React Testing Library, Playwright, and/or Cypress.
* Ensure tests are reliable, maintainable, and integrated into CI pipelines.
* Proactively prevent UI regressions through disciplined component design and test coverage.


**Accessibility, Performance \\& Polish**
* Ensure interfaces meet accessibility standards (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA where appropriate).
* Optimize rendering performance, bundle size, and runtime behavior for data\\-dense applications.
* Identify and remediate frontend technical debt.


**Collaboration \\& Delivery**
* Partner closely with Product Management and Design to shape interaction models early.
* Participate in estimation, technical planning, and execution of frontend initiatives.
* Provide clear technical input on UX complexity, performance trade\\-offs, and feasibility.
* Contribute to code reviews and raise the frontend engineering bar across the team. What We’re Looking For


**Required Qualifications**
* 5\\+ years of professional experience building production web applications with React and TypeScript.
* Strong hands\\-on experience with TailwindCSS and component libraries such as shadcn/ui or equivalents.
* Demonstrated experience building highly interactive, SVG\\- or canvas\\-based UIs.
* Practical experience with diagramming or graph libraries (ReactFlow, JointJS, D3, or similar).
* Proven experience writing frontend unit, integration, and end\\-to\\-end tests as part of normal development workflows.
* Hands\\-on experience with React Testing Library, Playwright, and/or Cypress.
* Strong understanding of frontend architecture, state management, and component composition.
* Ability to deliver high\\-quality, well\\-tested code in a collaborative environment.
* Strong written and verbal communication skills.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience building complex, data\\-heavy enterprise applications.
* Familiarity with design systems, token\\-based theming, and shared UI foundations.
* Experience integrating frontend test suites into CI/CD pipelines.
* Knowledge of React performance profiling and optimization techniques.
* Prior work on workflow editors, integration tooling, or low\\-code / visual configuration platforms.


**Senior\\-Level Expectations**
* Operate independently on well\\-scoped initiatives with minimal oversight.
* Take full ownership of frontend quality, including test coverage and regression prevention.
* Make sound technical decisions that balance user experience, performance, and maintainability.
* Proactively identify architectural risks and propose improvements.
* Serve as a strong partner to backend engineering, product, and design teams.


**Why Join Us:**
* Work on technically challenging problems with real\\-world impact.
* Build complex UI systems that go beyond typical CRUD interfaces.
* Influence frontend architecture and quality standards at a senior level.
* Collaborate with experienced engineers in a pragmatic, product\\-focused environment.
