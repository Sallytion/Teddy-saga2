**The Role**
 Infrastructure Specialists at Kyndryl are project\\-based subject matter experts in all things infrastructure – good at providing analysis, documenting and diagraming work for hand\\-off, offering timely solutions, and generally “figuring it out.” This is a hands\\-on role where your feel for the interaction between a system and its environment will be invaluable to every one of your clients.
   

  

 There are two halves to this role: First, contributing to current projects where you analyze problems and tech issues, offer solutions, and test, modify, automate, and integrate systems. And second, long\\-range strategic planning of IT infrastructure and operational execution. This role isn’t specific to any one platform, so you’ll need a good feel for all of them. And because of this, you’ll experience variety and growth at Kyndryl that you won’t find anywhere else.
   

  

 You’ll be involved early to offer solutions, help decide whether something can be done, and identify the technical and timeline risks up front. This means dealing with both client expectations and internal challenges – in other words, there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference, and a lot of people will witness your contributions. In fact, a frequent sign of success for our Infrastructure Specialists is when clients come back to us and ask for the same person by name. That’s the kind of impact you can have!
   

  

 Key Responsibilities:
   

  

* IDAA Installation \\& Management: Install, configure, and maintain IDAA using tools like GUI Management Console, Data Studio, and Admin Services.
* Data Synchronization: Manage and troubleshoot Db2\\-IDAA data sync for optimized query performance.
* IDAA Loader Administration: Install, configure, and maintain IDAA Loader for efficient data processing.
* Storage \\& Performance Optimization: Reallocate storage, improve system efficiency, and prevent slow SQL queries.
* System Administration: Perform admin tasks using Putty and Unix System Services (USS).
* Upgrades \\& Maintenance: Conduct IDAA loader and system maintenance upgrades to ensure stability and security.


 This is a project\\-based role where you’ll enjoy deep involvement throughout the lifespan of a project, as well as the chance to work closely with Architects, Technicians, and PMs. Whatever your current level of tech savvy or where you want your career to lead, you’ll find the right opportunities and a buddy to support your growth. Boredom? Trust us, that won’t be an issue.
   

  

 Your future at Kyndryl
   

  

 There are lots of opportunities to gain certification and qualifications on the job, and you’ll continuously grow as a Cloud Hyperscaler. Many of our Infrastructure Specialists are on a path toward becoming either an Architect or Distinguished Engineer, and there are opportunities at every skill level to grow in either of these directions.
