**Our Firm** 




 CF Corporation is a global leading firm in the human capital and technology space, operating, investing and advising since 1982, operating in 119 countries across our 30 individual companies.
 



  





 Our technology firm, CF Digital is a global technology business that designs and delivers advanced solutions across AI, data, security, and cloud platforms. We build products and systems that help organisations operate more efficiently, make better decisions, and scale with confidence. Working across multiple sectors, we combine deep technical capability with practical commercial understanding – focusing on outcomes, not experimentation for its own sake.
 



  





  





**Your Focus** 




 As a Machine Learning Software Engineer, you will design, build, and scale production\\-grade machine learning systems across AI, data, and cloud\\-led platforms.
 



  





 This role sits firmly in product development, not research showcase work. You’ll be responsible for turning models into reliable, performant software that runs in real environments, under real constraints, for real organisations.
 



  





 The focus is on deployable, scalable ML systems – models that integrate cleanly with products, perform efficiently in production, and deliver measurable value. Prototypes are only useful if they survive contact with reality.
 



  





  





**Responsibilities** 



* Design and implement machine learning systems that operate reliably in production
* Partner with data scientists and engineers to translate models into deployable services
* Optimise training and inference pipelines for performance, cost, and scalability
* Profile, analyse, and improve ML workloads across compute and data pipelines
* Improve end\\-to\\-end ML system efficiency, from data ingestion and feature pipelines to model execution and serving
* Own the production lifecycle of ML components, including monitoring, debugging, and iteration
* Make informed trade\\-offs between model complexity, performance, and operational reality



  





 You can absorb complex technical information quickly, understand problem constraints and system requirements with rigour, and form clear, practical technical decisions. You approach challenges with structure and engineering discipline, and you are comfortable working under pressure as projects evolve and requirements change.
 



  





 You bring pace, resilience, and strong attention to detail, and you work effectively with engineers, data scientists, and domain specialists without excessive direction. You communicate clearly, consider alternative approaches, and use them to improve solution quality and outcomes.
 



  





 This role suits someone who is technically strong, commercially aware, and prepared to be accountable for the robustness, performance, and real\\-world impact of the systems they build.
 



  





  





**Minimum Qualifications** 



* Ideally a degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Mathematics, Engineering, or a related technical discipline
* At least 3\\+ years’ experience building and deploying machine learning or data\\-driven systems
* Experience developing, training, or serving models using modern ML frameworks (e.g. PyTorch or similar)
* Experience optimising ML pipelines or inference systems for performance, cost, or scalability
* Solid software engineering fundamentals, including production\\-quality code and testing practices
* Experience training, validating, or serving large\\-scale machine learning models
* Practical understanding of parallelism in ML systems (data, model, or pipeline parallelism)
* Experience profiling and optimising ML workloads, including tuning model performance
* Understanding of the full ML lifecycle, from data preparation and training through to inference and monitoring
* Experience working with distributed or accelerator\\-based ML systems (e.g. GPUs or similar)
* Comfort moving between model\\-level decisions and production system constraints
* Ability to translate real\\-world problems into practical technical solutions



  





 We are open to considering candidates with experience outside of these brackets, if you feel you have the capabilities to deliver on our main criteria.
 



  





 We consider any degree or subject and although your grade indicates your ability to absorb data and apply it, your degree grade does not influence your chance of applying to us and being interviewed.
