**ABOUT LEGION**
 Join Legion's mission to turn hourly jobs into good jobs. We're a global, mission\\-driven team seeking exceptional talent to propel this vision. Embrace a culture that's collaborative, fast\\-paced, and entrepreneurial. With us, you'll grow your skills, work closely with experienced executives, and contribute significantly to our mission. Our award\\-winning AI\\-native workforce management platform is intelligent, automated, and employee\\-centric and proven to deliver 13x ROI. We help labor\\-intensive organizations maximize labor efficiency and employee engagement simultaneously.

 If you're ready to make an impact and grow your career, Legion is where you belong. Join us in making hourly work rewarding and fulfilling.
   

  

**BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY**
 There are almost 75 million hourly workers in the United States, representing more than half of the entire workforce. Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees. The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig\\-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options. Legion's mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by Legion's Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously.
   

  

 Legion WFM was built for the cloud with AI at the core and is designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses and meet the needs of today's hourly employees. Our team is composed of dedicated individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, globally distributed across all time zones.

 You’ll support the DevOps backbone that keeps WrkTalk running smoothly, securely, and at scale.
 



  





**Who are we?** 




  





 We are a young product company scaling fast and outgrowing the startup tag—with global scale in our crosshairs. We don’t do “okay.” We give everything we’ve got to build the best communication platform in the world. Our team includes engineers from IIT and other top institutions—people who care deeply about the craft, performance, and purpose. You’ll learn more in 6 months here than most engineers do in 3 years elsewhere. We’re intense. High\\-strung. Focused. Our team includes engineers from IIT and other top\\-tier
 



 backgrounds. But what defines us is not our degrees—it’s our refusal to compromise on quality, performance, or privacy.
 



  





**What are we building?** 




  





 WrkTalk is the world's first zero\\-access, zero\\-spam enterprise communication product that operates on a structural privacy architecture. One that’s already earned the trust of large enterprises like L\\&T Finance, Adani Group, and Kalyan Jewellers – just to name a few of our enterprise clients. This is not an MVP. This is production\\-grade software that secures communication for thousands—and soon, millions—of professionals worldwide.
 



  





**What’s the role?** 




  





 • Assist in implementing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.
 



 • Support Dockerized deployments and Kubernetes cluster management.
 



 • Learn to configure horizontal/vertical scaling, monitoring, and alerts.
 



 • Support private network setups, on\\-prem and private cloud deployments.
 



  





**The tech here is serious.** 




 We work on socket\\-driven comms infrastructure, distributed control towers, multi\\-category encryption, root detection, app kill\\-switches, dynamic guest access, device\\-level lockout, and OOO/ DND logic layered with smart whitelisting. This is not lightweight app dev. This is protocol\\-layer decision\\-making.
 



  





**Who should apply?** 




 • 1–2 years in DevOps or related roles.
 



 • Experience with Jenkins is a must
 



 • Familiarity with Docker, basic Kubernetes concepts.
 



 • Understanding of cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) is a plus.
 



 • Willingness to learn on\\-prem deployments and secure infrastructure practices.
 



 • You should know at least one scripting language such as Bash Script, Shell Script, etc.
 



 • You should have experience in setting up infrastructure using Terraform and configuring it using Ansible
 



  





**Why should you join?** 




  





 • Because you want to build the DevOps backbone that keeps WrkTalk running smoothly
 



 • Because you’ll work directly with established founders, not buried under layers
 



 • Because you’ll ship real, deeply engineered features used by large number of enterprise users
 



 • Because you’ll grow 10x faster here—in experience, learning, and impact
 



 • And because if you walk this road with us for 3–4 years, it’ll catapult you into a tech orbit or fame and glory you never imagined
