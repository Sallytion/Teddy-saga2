 You’ll join a fast\\-moving team building the core platform that powers our rapidly growing omni\\-
 



 channel business, built on top of the open\\-source ERP, Odoo.
 



  





 This platform is our central nervous system — connecting sales, inventory, operations, finance,
 



 and more.You’ll be part of a senior engineering team tackling high\\-leverage problems with real ownership and tight feedback loops. If you're a seasoned engineer who wants to go deep on architecture, own meaningful systems end to end, and write clean, maintainable code — this role is for you.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities/What You Will Do** 




 You'll take end\\-to\\-end ownership of a meaningful part of our internal platform — from system
 



 architecture to implementation to long\\-term reliability.
 



 • Design, implement, and maintain features in a large Python\\-based monolith with
 



 PostgreSQL as the primary database, built on top of Odoo.
 



 • Develop a strong understanding of Odoo’s internal codebase to align with its
 



 architecture and design philosophy — enabling us to build features that are reliable,
 



 extensible, and maintainable.
 



 • Own entire modules and systems — and be accountable for their quality, reliability, and
 



 long\\-term maintainability.
 



 • Drive engineering best practices, including code quality, testing, observability, and
 



 performance monitoring.
 



 • Collaborate with business stakeholders to turn ambiguous, real\\-world needs into
 



 structured, well\\-scoped technical solutions
 



 ● Shape and drive the technical roadmap by staying closely aligned with both Odoo’s
 



 upcoming releases and internal business priorities — ensuring we build for what’s
 



 coming, not just what exists today.
 



 ● Partner with DevOps to improve our CI/CD pipeline, software testing infrastructure, and
 



 performance tooling.
 



 ● Actively monitor systems and performance metrics to detect — and prevent — outages
 



 or regressions before they impact the business.
 



 ● Contribute to a strong engineering culture through code reviews, weekly design reviews,
 



 quality reviews, and RCAs with other senior engineers.
 



**Qualifications \\& Skills/What You Need** 




 ● Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field.
 



 ● 3\\+ years of experience building, maintaining, and improving large\\-scale software
 



 systems — preferably in Python.
 



 ● Strong SQL fundamentals, with experience in data modeling, query optimization, and
 



 performance tuning.
 



 ● Familiarity with best practices in testing, debugging, version control (Git), and
 



 monitoring/observability tooling.","Software Development, Technology, Information and Media, and Retail","https://in.linkedin.com/company/recro-io","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQH7GYOGBCj8Qg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1728907260215/recro_io_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=898rSyj182aC0vqi5cZqbWQQIDumt_WpercCJsH_-TY","","","","","","","","","","",""
