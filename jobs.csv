 backgrounds. But what defines us is not our degrees—it’s our refusal to compromise on quality, performance, or privacy.
 



  





**What are we building?** 




  





 WrkTalk is the world's first zero\\-access, zero\\-spam enterprise communication product that operates on a structural privacy architecture. One that’s already earned the trust of large enterprises like L\\&T Finance, Adani Group, and Kalyan Jewellers – just to name a few of our enterprise clients. This is not an MVP. This is production\\-grade software that secures communication for thousands—and soon, millions—of professionals worldwide.
 



  





**What’s the role?** 




  





 • Design and build blazing\\-fast, secure APIs using NestJS and Golang
 



 • Architect robust microservices that scale and perform under pressure
 



 • Engineer real\\-time communication using WebSockets, WebRTC, and mediasoup
 



 • Optimize and tune PostgreSQL and Redis for lightning\\-fast access and reliability
 



 • Lead Dockerized deployments and manage Kubernetes clusters
 



 • Collaborate with our high\\-performance team of frontend devs, DevOps, and product leaders to ship elite\\-quality code
 



 • Build for zero\\-trust environments—because no data should ever leak
 



  





**The tech here is serious.** 




 We work on socket\\-driven comms infrastructure, distributed control towers, multi\\-category encryption, root detection, app kill\\-switches, dynamic guest access, device\\-level lockout, and OOO/ DND logic layered with smart whitelisting. This is not lightweight app dev. This is protocol\\-layer decision\\-making.
 



  





**Why should you join?** 




  





 • Because you want to own backend architecture—not just follow it
 



 • Because you’ll work directly with established founders, not buried under layers
 



 • Because you’ll ship real, deeply engineered features used by large number of enterprise users
 



 • Because you’ll grow 10x faster here—in experience, learning, and impact
 



 • And because if you walk this road with us for 3–4 years, it’ll catapult you into a tech orbit or fame and glory you never imagined
 



  





**Who should apply?** 




  





 • 3\\+ years of backend experience building high\\-performance systems
 



 • Expertise in Golang and Node.js (NestJS)
 



 • Deep knowledge of PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes
 



 • Strong command over microservices, RESTful APIs, and authentication protocols
 



 • Prior experience with real\\-time systems (WebSockets, WebRTC, mediasoup is a big plus)
 



 • Builders. Owners. With hunger to ship fast, fail fast, and optimize endlessly
 



  





**Where are we located?** 




 We’re based in Navi Mumbai and building for the world.","Data Security Software Products, Technology, Information and Media, and IT Services and IT Consulting","https://in.linkedin.com/company/wrktalk-io","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQHheVmzqMa86g/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1714278260972/wrktalk_io_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Jz70zOzUYtL3N4Fs1_6flgtf7zybajP0pudXeQiK8Ro","","","","","","","","","","",""

* TimeBack: An educational platform driving Alpha School's 2\\-hour learning model (99th percentile test results).
* Incept: A content generation platform producing all personalized educational materials for multiple learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
* Crossover: An AI\\-powered hiring platform handling tens of thousands of applicants monthly, staffing schools and companies worldwide.


 You will own one of these platforms and dedicate most of your time to building the most complex parts of the codebase with a small team (3\\-5 experienced engineers, no juniors). The architectural choices you make will define whether other teams can build new applications quickly, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Strong decisions enable enormous leverage. Poor ones generate integration chaos and degrade velocity across multiple teams.
   

  

 You design, build, and operate your own work. You set quality standards and define patterns for your platform. We operate spec\\-driven: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. High autonomy, no committees, no review boards. A small, cohesive team where you own what you deliver.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Define strategic architectural choices and set technical patterns for the team to adopt.
* AI Leadership: Champion new AI workflows and develop high\\-impact playbooks.
* Implementation: Develop the most complex, high\\-stakes components of the codebase with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality standards.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Acting as an architect without hands\\-on implementation

* At least 3 years as either a lead engineer (reviewing others' work) or architect (making key technical decisions)
* Experience working on platform\\-level products where other teams consumed your APIs
* Deep engagement with AI tools, actively experimenting and pushing boundaries
