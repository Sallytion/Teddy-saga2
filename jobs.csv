**🚀 Seeking Co\\-Founder \\& CTO for Oriflow: AI Mind for Mastering Anything** 
**\\*\\*** 




  





 Most ""AI productivity tools"" are fancy to\\-do lists. We're building something fundamentally different:
 **\\*\\*** 
**Oriflow—an AI mind that helps you master anything** 
**\\*\\*** 
 .
 



  





 Personal growth doesn't recognize work\\-life boundaries. Sprint planning at work. Meditation habits. Side projects. Learning new skills. Current AI tools treat these as disconnected toy use cases. We're building the first Agentic AI platform with a proprietary 6\\-layer taxonomy of thought that captures context, scaffolds systems, and adapts in real\\-time—finally bridging user\\-agency, simplicity, and gamification.
 



  





 Think of it as a second brain across Work and Life that transforms toy use cases into sticky daily defaults. Our continuous, evolving context makes this the AI companion that actually understands you and how you grow.
 



  





**\\*\\*** 
**Where we are:** 
**\\*\\*** 
 Pre\\-seed stage, thinking global from day one. Our founding team includes alumni from University of Cambridge, IIT Kharagpur, ITU Copenhagen, and Meta. We're targeting a 3\\.5B\\+ addressable market: job seekers, lifelong learners, neurodivergent individuals—anyone who needs adaptive systems for growth. Our proprietary 6\\-layer cognitive engine is in pursuit of a human centric approach to AGI.
 



  





**\\*\\*** 
**What we bring:** 
**\\*\\*** 
 Deep AI/ML research background from top\\-tier institutions, product vision validated through extensive user research, strong technical foundation in agentic AI architecture, clear path to product\\-market fit, and a network across academia and tech giants.
 



  





**\\*\\*** 
**The role:** 
**\\*\\*** 
 As Co\\-Founder \\& CTO, you'll architect and build the full\\-stack consumer app from the ground up, lead technical strategy, design the UX/UI that makes complex AI feel magical and intuitive, build and scale our agentic AI platform using Next.js and Vercel AI SDK, establish engineering culture, and co\\-own the vision for achieving AGI through our 6\\-layer cognitive engine.
 



  





**\\*\\*** 
**Who you are:** 
**\\*\\*** 
 You have full\\-stack mastery with production experience shipping consumer apps, a UX/design thinking mindset (you understand that great AI needs invisible UX), 5\\+ years of software engineering experience, deep curiosity about AI frontiers, and full\\-time commitment with a 7\\-10 year horizon. You're passionate about personal growth, learning, and human potential.
 



  





**\\*\\*** 
**Big advantage if you have:** 
**\\*\\*** 
 Next.js expertise (our primary stack), Vercel AI SDK experience, previous startup/founding experience (0→1 product), AI/ML engineering background (LLMs, agents, RAG), mobile development experience, or have built gamified or consumer social products before.
 



  





**\\*\\*** 
**The opportunity:** 
**\\*\\*** 
 This is a true co\\-founder role with equal decision\\-making authority. We're open to structures with or without capital contribution (SAFE or convertible note available for co\\-founders investing). Pre\\-seed stage means massive upside potential working with a mission\\-driven team pursuing breakthrough AI. Remote\\-first, location\\-flexible.
 



  





**\\*\\*** 
**What we're looking for:** 
**\\*\\*** 
 Long\\-term thinking—this is a 7\\-10 year journey to build something transformative. You bring the technical and design excellence to match our AI research depth. You have an ownership mentality and want to co\\-own this company, not just work for it. You're resilient, excited by fast\\-moving AI frontiers, and believe consumer AI requires invisible UX and delightful experiences
