 If you're ready to make an impact and grow your career, Legion is where you belong. Join us in making hourly work rewarding and fulfilling.
   

  

**BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY**
 There are almost 75 million hourly workers in the United States, representing more than half of the entire workforce. Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees. The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig\\-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options. Legion's mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by Legion's Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously.
   

  

 Legion WFM was built for the cloud with AI at the core and is designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses and meet the needs of today's hourly employees. Our team is composed of dedicated individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, globally distributed across all time zones.

**The Longer Story**
 OutSystems enables enterprise teams to build AI\\-powered applications and agents that reduce manual work, streamline internal operations, and accelerate impact. A proven low\\-code foundation combined with agentic AI and AI app generation capabilities empowers teams to move up to 10x faster with the assurance of security, scalability, and governance built in.
   

  

 As the future becomes agentic, our customers need us now more than ever. AI has opened the door to extraordinary possibilities—but inside the enterprise, things are moving fast and feeling chaotic. Some early adopters are making progress in production, but for many, AI tools are sprawling without governance, data isn’t ready, and talent isn’t there yet. Enterprises are still drowning in application backlogs and struggling with legacy systems. But with the right platform, AI doesn’t have to add to the chaos. It can become the breakthrough that brings clarity—and drives real, enterprise\\-wide impact. At OutSystems, we’ve built that platform, providing the tools necessary for enterprises to overcome these hurdles.
   

  

 We are looking for passionate, talented, and motivated people to join us in helping our customers build, deploy, and scale apps and agents—fast, helping them accelerate innovation while enabling secure, governed human\\-AI collaboration.
   

  

 OutSystems is a truly global company, with more than 850,000 developer community members, 1,700 employees, more than 500 partners, and thousands of active customers in over 75 countries and across 21 industries. Founded in 2001, OutSystems has offices in the United States, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal, Germany, the UAE, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Singapore, and of course has a thriving, worldwide community of remote employees.
   

  

 Amongst our 2,400 customers are some of the world's most recognizable brands across diverse industries—brands like Toyota, Heineken, Bosch, KeyBank, and UCLA. These customers are the reason we have a 4\\.6 star rating on G2\\. Their success is ours, and their stories demonstrate tangible ROI and transformational impact. We are a 9x Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader for Low\\-Code Application Platforms and a multi\\-year leader in the Forrester Wave. We’re recognized not just as leaders but as visionaries with a strong ability to execute, now extending our leadership into the AI and agentic application development arena.
   

  

**Working at OutSystems**
 Our goal is to ensure that OutSystems is a place for bright, happy, and motivated people who share a common purpose and take pride in doing excellent work to pursue our vision of providing the AI\\-powered low\\-code development platform enterprise leaders trust to build, secure, and evolve their business applications, agents, and core systems.

Our team members operate with transparency, integrity, and accountability, define success through the lens of the outcomes we deliver for our customers, push the boundaries with excellence, and work together toward our shared vision to deliver on what matters most.
   

  

**What do we have to offer you?**
* A company that is always growing, changing, and innovating. We challenge each other to innovate in our products, in our team, and how we use our own technology. And we give our teams space to be proactive and creative.
* Real career opportunities. We care about growth and development. Yes, vertical career progression is a possibility, but it's not the only one. From lateral moves and joining different teams to mastering specialized skills, we support your growth no matter what your goals are.
