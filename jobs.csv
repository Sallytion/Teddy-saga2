 What are the biggest challenges for the team?
   

  

 The biggest challenges for the team are reliability and performance. The growth of the business is driving us to improve the ability of our systems to scale out and handle traffic patterns that are several orders of magnitude greater than what we can support today.
   

  

 We understand that software is living and needs investment. The challenge is making the right tradeoffs, communicating those decisions effectively, and crisp execution.
   

  

 We need engineers who can build services that handle millions of requests per second. We need engineers who can figure out how we can survive regional data center outages and protect our customers. We need engineers who can build services that enable us to offer even more options to customers and contribute to the overall growth of Oracle Cloud.

 As a founding engineer, you’ll work directly with the founders (former Amazon supply chain and
   

  

 technology leaders) to build the core product from the ground up—spanning LLMs, optimization,
   

  

 simulations, agent\\-driven workflows, and a reimagined product experience that tightly connects data,
   

  

 insights, and action. We are hiring a Lead Developer to be the technical backbone of Strum AI. This
   

  

 person will own system architecture end\\-to\\-end and lead the build\\-out of our backend platform, agent
   

  

 framework, and the interaction layer that brings decision intelligence into the flow of work. This is
   

  

 a hands\\-on, founding\\-level role. You will design the system, write critical code, influence product UX,
   

  

 and make architectural decisions that will shape the company.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
  Platform Architecture: Design and own Strum AI’s core architecture across data ingestion,
   

  

 modeling services, agent workflows, APIs, and UI integration
   

  

  Agentic Workflow Engine: Build the agent framework that powers simulations, decision support,
   

  

 and automated workflows; Design reusable action blocks (e.g., query forecast, run optimization,
   

  

 simulate scenarios, trigger downstream actions)
   

  

  Backend \\& APIs: Build production\\-grade backend services (Python\\-first); Develop APIs
   

  

 supporting probabilistic forecasts, inventory optimization, simulations, and what\\-if analysis
   

  

  Frontend \\& Product Interaction: Help reimagine the frontend by bringing Bring a strong
   

  

 product intuition to data\\-heavy, decision\\-intelligence workflows; while you don’t need to be a
   

  

 frontend specialist, you should be comfortable shipping meaningful UI code and shaping API–UI
   

  

 contract
   

  

  Data \\& Systems: Help define and evolve Strum’s canonical supply\\-chain data model; Build
   

  

 ingestion pipelines that handle messy enterprise data and schema drift
   

  

 What We’re Looking For
   

  

**Required**
  8\\+ years of professional software engineering experience
   

  

  Strong backend and systems design experience
   

  

  Production\\-grade Python expertise
   

  

  Experience building distributed systems, platforms, or workflow engines
   

  

  Ability to operate with ambiguity and incomplete requirements
   

  

 Strong Plus
   

  

  Experience building and scaling SaaS products end\\-to\\-end
   

  

  Experience with machine learning, optimization, LLMs, agent frameworks
   

  

  Comfort working across backend and frontend boundaries
