 Whatfix is an AI platform advancing the “userization” of enterprise applications, empowering companies to maximize the ROI of their digital investments. Technology needs adoption. It’s no different for AI. As AI reshapes roles, workflows, and human\\-machine interactions, it also introduces new layers of complexity and user friction. This is where Whatfix plays a pivotal role. A decade old DNA of empowering people to succeed with technology and not replacing them. We call this philosophy
 **Userization** 
 : the belief that technology must adapt to the user, not the other way around.
 



  





 At the heart of userization philosophy is
 **ScreenSense** 
 , our proprietary AI engine, which continuously interprets both the context of what users are doing in an application or an AI tool and the intent behind their actions. By combining these signals, Whatfix delivers real\\-time guidance, nudges, knowledge, and automation directly in the flow of work.
 



  





 This intelligence powers our entire product suite.
 



  




* **Digital Adoption** 
 helps users get productive faster.
* **Product Analytics** 
 uncovers friction and closes adoption gaps.
* **Mirror** 
 allows employees to train in safe, simulated environments.



  





 These are embedded with Whatfix
 **AI Agents** 
 which supercharge creation, insights, and user guidance.
 



  





 Our upcoming
 **AI\\-first products** 
 are already creating a buzz in the market.
 


* **Seek** 
 is an AI\\-native assistant that not only knows your business context but can also act across applications to get work done on your behalf.
* **Whatfix Mirror 2\\.0** 
 is the world’s only System plus Role simulation with a complete assessment to lead the Gen AI simulation category.



  





 Together, these products reflect Whatfix’s commitment to building enterprise\\-ready AI teammates that maximize productivity and ROI. It gives users a unified, intelligent way to find answers across systems, apps, and knowledge silos and helps anyone looking to deliver fast and contextual answers.
 



  





 Whatfix is bridging the gap between rapid technological change and human enablement—ensuring AI is not only embedded but also usable, trusted, and outcome\\-driven for every employee.
