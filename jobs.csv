 Application Modernization Platform (“AMP”) is a MongoDB offering that modernizes our customers’ legacy relational applications to a modern architecture, platform, and stack underpinned by MongoDB using a combination of software, processes, and engineers. In this offering, the people and software are inextricably linked and cannot be separated. AMP delivery teams consist of application delivery engineers and a project manager who work onsite with the customer to modernize one or more of the customer’s applications in an accelerated timeframe. Our delivery teams leverage a mix of AI and deterministic custom tooling to expedite application delivery.
   

  

 MongoDB has various AMP delivery teams globally, supported by a small, central, non\\-customer\\-facing unit: the AMP Delivery Excellence team. This team elevates delivery effectiveness by developing and implementing the Application Transformation Framework (ATF), MongoDB's standardized process for modernizing applications. The team also creates tools to systematically track project delivery effectiveness, pinpointing inefficiencies that then drive product engineering and process improvements. Utilizing this data, the team collaborates with MongoDB’s internal Product Engineering team to shape the AMP product roadmap based on identified needs. Furthermore, the team uses AI to develop and evolve simulation applications that mimic common customer modernization challenges, helping to clearly identify product gaps and test the new features implemented by the Product Engineering team to address them.
   

  

 As a critical member of the AMP Delivery Excellence team, the Practice Engineer will help innovate, build, and evolve the team's core assets and initiatives, collaborating closely with peers and the Technical Program Manager. This role partly involves working as a software developer in an Agile environment, innovating on solutions for specific challenges that help to evolve the AMP practice.
   

  

 We are looking to speak to candidates who are based in Bengaluru for our hybrid working model, and you will often be collaborating with stakeholders in other regions and time zones.
   

  

 Position Expectations
   

  

* Create \\& Scale Enablement / Training Material. Channel your passion for teaching into designing, building, and maintaining high\\-impact, scalable enablement artifacts for the delivery teams. This includes role\\-based training courses (micro\\-modules, videos, labs, assessments) and onboarding/everboarding paths for Delivery Engineers and Project Managers
* Evolve the Application Transformation Framework (ATF). Develop and maintain the core processes of our modernization methodology, including diagram\\-first process maps, ensuring the internal ATF site is the single source of truth
* Develop AI\\-driven Simulation Applications. Use AI and software development skills to build and evolve simulation applications that mimic common customer modernization challenges, to clearly identify product gaps, and test new features
* Develop Acceleration Tools. Use AI and software development skills to build and evolve reusable developer tools for delivery engineers to use on customer projects, to speed up the implementation of everyday project application transformation tasks that have been identified as relevant for multiple customer projects
* Drive Product \\& Process Improvement. Perform technical discovery by liaising with in\\-flight projects (shadowing, retrospectives) to identify bottlenecks. Synthesize these findings into well\\-formed product enhancement requests and collaborate with Product Engineering on prioritization and implementation
* Harvest \\& Publish Reusable Assets. Capture field\\-proven assets, solutions, and playbooks from projects; generalize them and publish them back into the central ATF and enablement library
* Define \\& Track Delivery Metrics. Help define and implement delivery telemetry, instrumenting ATF adoption signals and outcome metrics to contribute to concise internal dashboards
* Support \\& Mentor the Internal Community. Act as a key enablement partner by hosting office hours, contributing to internal help channels, and mentoring practitioners to amplify best practices


**Technical Skills And Requirements**
* Software Development. 4\\+ years in software development, directly involved as a developer on teams building enterprise\\-grade applications for organizations
* Programming Languages. Practical experience and proficiency in both:
+ Building Java applications using enterprise frameworks like JEE or Spring.
+ Creating tools and scripts using Python or JavaScript/Node.js to solve recurring integration/automation problems.

* Databases. Expertise in relational databases, particularly in SQL, stored procedures, and ORM tools like JPA and Hibernate
* System Design. Strong experience with system design, microservices architectures, and Domain\\-Driven Design approaches
* Technical Documentation. Demonstrated ability to create clear, high\\-quality technical documentation, including architectural diagrams
* Software Delivery Best Practices. Experience in using Agile and TDD methodologies, developing CI/CD pipelines, and leveraging Git version control
* Containerization. Knowledge of containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes
* Cloud Platforms. Experience in developing and deploying on at least one of the AWS/Azure/GCP cloud platforms


 Bonus Skills
   

  

* MongoDB. Hands\\-on experience with MongoDB
* Technical Enablement Delivery. Experience designing and/or delivering technical training, enablement content, or tutorials. Having experience educating people through a teaching channel or on larger platforms with growing audiences is an advantage
* AI/LLM. Hands\\-on experience with using LLMs and AI technologies to aid development and/or build AI\\-based solutions
* Data Analysis. Familiarity with data analysis or business intelligence tools for creating dashboards and tracking metrics


 Key Competencies
   

  

* Enablement Mindset. A genuine passion for acting as a force multiplier. This includes mentoring practitioners and a strong desire to create high\\-quality, reusable enablement artifacts (documentation, videos, training) that elevate the entire delivery organization
* Cross\\-Functional Collaboration. Ability to partner effectively with Product Management, Engineering, and field\\-facing teams to drive alignment and deliver results
* Exceptional Communication. Strong technical writing skills; can distill complex technical concepts into clear, concise process maps, documentation, and release notes
* Problem\\-Solving \\& Innovation. A systems\\-thinker with a passion for identifying process bottlenecks, analyzing root causes, and innovating solutions (e.g., AI\\-driven simulation applications, improved tooling)
* Data\\-Driven. An analytical approach to defining and measuring success, using telemetry and feedback to drive continuous improvement


 A Week in the Life
   

  

 In any given week, your work will vary, following a sprint\\-based rhythm. A typical week is a dynamic mix of development, strategic analysis, and innovation on new processes and enablement materials. You might spend a couple of days building out a new module for an AI\\-driven simulation test application or a reusable tool for use on multiple customer projects, then pivot to creating a new video tutorial for an ATF process you helped define. You'll also dedicate time to liaising with the Product/Engineering team on product roadmap priorities, testing a new product feature against your simulation app, and analyzing telemetry from recent field projects. This is balanced with direct engagement with project delivery teams, such as joining a project retrospective to gather firsthand feedback, ensuring our internal assets are always grounded in real\\-world delivery experience.
