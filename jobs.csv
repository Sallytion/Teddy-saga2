* **Adapt pre\\-trained models for multimodal tasks (text, image, audio, video, or cross\\-modal reasoning).**
* **Ensure seamless interoperability between modalities — e.g., enabling the system to “see, hear, and talk” naturally.**



**2\\. Model Optimization for Edge Hardware** 



* **Quantize and compress large models (4\\-bit or mixed precision) while maintaining high accuracy and low latency.**
* **Implement and benchmark inference runtimes using frameworks like Llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM, ONNX etc.**
* **Collaborate with hardware engineers to co\\-design model architectures optimized for the appliance’s compute fabric.**



**3\\. Inference Pipeline Development** 



* **Build and maintain scalable, high\\-throughput inference pipelines capable of handling concurrent multimodal requests (text, audio, image, video).**
* **Implement token streaming, caching, and scheduling strategies for real\\-time responses.**
* **Develop APIs for low\\-latency local inference accessible via a web interface.**



**4\\. Evaluation \\& Benchmarking** 



* **Profile and benchmark performance (throughput, latency, energy efficiency) of deployed models.**
* **Run regression tests to validate numerical accuracy after quantization or pruning.**
* **Define KPIs for multimodal model performance under real\\-world usage.**



**5\\. Research \\& Prototyping** 



* **Investigate emerging multimodal architectures and lightweight model variants for local deployment.**
* **Prototype hybrid models that combine LLMs, diffusion models, and ASR/TTS pipelines for advanced multimodal applications.**
* **Stay current on state\\-of\\-the\\-art inference frameworks, compression techniques, and multimodal learning trends.**








**Required Qualifications:** 



* **Strong background in deep learning and model deployment, with hands\\-on experience in PyTorch and/or TensorFlow.**
* **Expertise in model optimization — quantization, pruning, distillation, or mixed\\-precision inference.**
* **Practical knowledge of inference engines (vLLM, llama.cpp, ONNX Runtime or similar).**
* **Experience deploying large models locally or on edge devices with limited memory/compute constraints.**
* **Familiarity with multimodal model architectures — e.g., CLIP, Flamingo, LLaVA, or AudioGPT\\-style systems.**
* **Strong software engineering skills (Python, C\\+\\+, CUDA) and experience integrating models into production systems.**
* **Understanding of GPU/accelerator utilization, memory bandwidth optimization, and distributed inference.**








**Preferred Qualifications:** 




**experience\\-10\\+ years** 



* **Experience with model\\-parallel or tensor\\-parallel inference at scale.**
* **Contributions to open\\-source inference frameworks or model serving systems.**
* **Familiarity with hardware\\-aware training or co\\-optimization of neural networks and hardware.**
