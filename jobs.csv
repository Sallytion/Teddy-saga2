**Job Description**
***Job Family Definition:***
 Designs, develops, troubleshoots and debugs software programs for software enhancements and new products. Develops software including operating systems, compilers, routers, networks, utilities, databases and Internet\\-related tools. Determines hardware compatibility and/or influences hardware design.
   

  

**Management Level Definition**
 Contributions include applying developed subject matter expertise to solve common and sometimes complex technical problems and recommending alternatives where necessary. Might act as project lead and provide assistance to lower level professionals. Exercises independent judgment and consults with others to determine best method for accomplishing work and achieving objectives.
   

  

 The Infrastructure team under Apstra owns and evolves the backend infrastructure for Apstra.
   

  

**Join a team where systems and data engineering converge**
 You'll work at the core of a high\\-performance, custom\\-built infrastructure platform—while also helping shape the data pipelines that power our next\\-gen cloud analytics stack. This role offers rare dual exposure: from low\\-level optimization in performance\\-critical systems, to hands\\-on feature development in in\\-house time\\-series and graph databases. You’ll contribute to building and refining connectivity for these databases to the cloud, driving real\\-world data flows across hybrid environments. If you're excited by deep infrastructure, data\\-intensive workloads, and full\\-stack thinking, this is where your impact multiplies.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* Core Infrastructure (60% of Role)
* Maintains and enhances the backend platform that powers Apstra’s configuration, telemetry, and analytics pipeline.
* Owns:
+ Product packaging, upgrades, and deployment orchestration
+ Homegrown file\\-based telemetry database (custom\\-built, optimized for performance)
+ Distributed querying, data merging, system calls, IPC
+ Python \\+ C\\+\\+ hybrid execution, including C\\-extensions for performance

* Data Engineering (40% of Role)
* Enables data synchronization from on\\-prem Apstra to on JCloud.
* Constructs data pipelines and ETL flows to prepare, transform, and deliver telemetry for downstream cloud analytics consumers.
* Owns cloud enablement and sync logic (e.g. examples datasets, format normalization, usage signals).


**Why Candidates Should Join This Team**
 You’ll Build Real Infrastructure—Not Just Configure It
   

  

 This isn’t “infra as code”—it’s infrastructure as a product. You’ll design, scale, and optimize distributed systems that support real\\-time, multi\\-version enterprise network workloads across campus, data center, and WAN fabrics. It’s infrastructure that directly powers next\\-gen cloud analytics.
   

  

**Hybrid Challenge: On\\-Prem Meets Cloud**
 Few roles offer this blend: deep low\\-level systems work coupled with forward\\-looking data engineering. You'll help bridge Apstra’s on\\-prem legacy with its evolving cloud\\-native future, working across environments to modernize and integrate.
   

  

 Deep Ownership \\+ Technical Core
   

  

 This team doesn’t just connect APIs. It owns the architecture behind Apstra’s analytics and telemetry engines—critical infrastructure that underpins Juniper’s most advanced networking insights.
   

  

**Custom Database Engineering \\+ Analytics Edge**
 You’ll work directly on our in\\-house telemetry database, focusing on:
   

  

* Compression, distributed query execution, and performance tuning
* Building feature enhancements for in\\-house time\\-series and graph databases
* Enabling cloud connectivity and insights generation for real\\-world data use cases


**Cloud**
 You'll get early exposure to JCloud, our internal cloud platform. Think AWS\\-like building blocks—serverless functions, ETL pipelines, distributed stores—but tuned for networking workloads, security, and high observability.
   

  

**What You Need To Bring**
***Education and Experience Required:***
* Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, or equivalent.
* Typically 4\\-6 years experience.


**Additional Skills**
 Cloud Architectures, Cross Domain Knowledge, Design Thinking, Development Fundamentals, DevOps, Distributed Computing, Microservices Fluency, Full Stack Development, Security\\-First Mindset, Solutions Design, Testing \\& Automation, User Experience (UX)
   

  

**What We Can Offer You**
**Health \\& Wellbeing**
 We strive to provide our team members and their loved ones with a comprehensive suite of benefits that supports their physical, financial and emotional wellbeing.
   

  

**Personal \\& Professional Development**
 We also invest in your career because the better you are, the better we all are. We have specific programs catered to helping you reach any career goals you have — whether you want to become a knowledge expert in your field or apply your skills to another division.
   

  

**Unconditional Inclusion**
 We are unconditionally inclusive in the way we work and celebrate individual uniqueness. We know varied backgrounds are valued and succeed here. We have the flexibility to manage our work and personal needs. We make bold moves, together, and are a force for good.
