**About ScanPay** 




 ScanPay is a fintech innovator building payment solutions for onsite service professionals.
 



 Backed by top global investors, we process \\~
 **$300 Million in annual volume** 
 and are scaling
 



 to
 **a $billion\\+** 
 . We're building simple, low\\-cost payment technology designed specifically for
 



 field service businesses. Our technology hub drives innovation for thousands of businesses
 



 across the US.
 



  





**The Opportunity** 




 We're looking for
 **builders who ship at speed** 
 .
 



 You know that feeling when you're in a co\\-working space and everyone's just
 *grinding* 
 ?
 



 That
 



 energy when someone's debugging at 2pm, figures it out, ships it by 4pm, and moves to the
 



 next thing? That's the vibe.
 



 We want engineers who say
 **""let me try something""** 
 instead of
 **""how does this work?""** 




  





**What Makes You a Ninja?** 




**You're excited to:** 




  





 Ship features users see within days, not months
 



 Build full\\-stack: React UI → API → database → deploy
 



 Figure things out yourself (read docs, hunt through code, test stuff)
 



 Own problems end\\-to\\-end and make them work
 



 Learn by breaking things and fixing them fast
 



 Work on whatever needs to get done: frontend, backend, integrations, tools
 



  





**You don't need:** 




  





 Perfect specs before you start coding
 



 Someone to hold your hand through every step
 



 A senior title or ego validation
 



 To ask 10 questions before writing your first line of code
 



 Approval to try something new
 



  





**Day\\-to\\-Day Reality** 




  





**Morning** 
 : Product says ""we need invoice PDF generation""
 



 You: Read docs, check PDF libraries, start coding
 



 By EOD: Working prototype users can test
 



  





**Afternoon** 
 : Bug reported in payment flow
 



 You: Hunt through logs, find the issue, fix it, deploy
 



 2 hours later: Users confirm it's working
 



  





**Next day** 
 : ""Can we integrate with QuickBooks?""
 



 You: Read QuickBooks API docs, test auth flow, build integration
 



 By week end: Customers syncing invoices automatically
 



  





**No drama. No waiting. Just ship.** 




  





**What You'll Build** 




**Customer\\-Facing Products** 




 Payment dashboards, invoicing tools, reporting UIs
 



 Payment flows, checkout experiences, transaction history
 



 Admin panels, analytics, customer portals
 



  





**Backend \\& Integrations** 




 REST APIs for frontend features
 



 Integrations with payment processors, accounting tools
 



 Webhooks, background jobs, data sync pipelines
 



 Database queries, schema changes, data migrations
 



 Data analytics
 



  





**Whatever Needs Doing** 




 Automation scripts, internal tools, CI/CD improvements
 



 Bug fixes, performance optimizations, monitoring
 



 Customer requests, support escalations, production issues
 



  





**How you are expected to operate** 




**Ship First, Perfect Later** 




 Build → Deploy → Get feedback → Iterate
 



 AI tools (Cursor, Copilot) handle boilerplate, you solve real problems
 



 Automated CI/CD gets your code to production fast
 



  





**Learn by Doing** 




 Senior Engineer guides when needed, otherwise you figure it out
 



 Read docs, browse code, test locally, break things safely
 



 Real production systems, real user feedback, real learning
 



  





**Low Ego, High Output** 




 No politics, no titles — just build and ship
 



 Everyone pitches in on everything
 



 Exposed to entire company: product, ops, customers, CTO
 



  





**Requirements** 




  





**Technical (Baseline)** 




  





**1\\-3 years** 
 of building software (or strong side projects/hustle)
 



**React/Next.js/** 
**JavaScript/TypeScript** 
**:** 
 Build modern UIs, components, hooks, state management
 



**Core** 

 : Go (Golang), Python, Redis
 




**Data** 
 : SQL,
 
 PostgreSQL, AWS S3
 




**Git basics** 
 : Commit, push, PR, merge
 



  





  





**Mindset (Critical)** 




  





**Hunter mentality** 
 : ""Let me figure this out"" is your first response
 



**Execution speed** 
 : More code than questions
 



**Learn fast** 
 : Pick up new tech by doing, not just reading
 



**Fail forward** 
 : Try → Break → Fix → Learn → Repeat
 



**Zero ego** 
 : Happy to learn, happy to ship, happy to be here
 



**Grind mode activated** 
 : You're all\\-in on making this work
 



  





**What You'll Gain In 12 months:** 




 Ship dozens of features impacting thousands of users
 



 Master full\\-stack development: React → Go → PostgreSQL → AWS
 



 Build payment systems processing millions in real transactions
 



 Debug production systems under real pressure
 



 Understand fintech: payments, compliance, distributed systems
 



 Become an engineer who can build anything, anywhere
 



  





**Career Growth:** 




 Prove yourself by shipping → take on bigger challenges
 



 Early equity in a fast\\-growing startup
 



 Ground\\-floor opportunity with founding engineering team
 



 Direct exposure to CTO and company leadership
 



  





**The Team** 




 You'll work with:
