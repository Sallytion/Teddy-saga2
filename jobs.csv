**What you’ll do** 




 In your first year you’ll ship production code every week across Python\\- and Go\\-based services and a React/Next.js frontend that screens millions of candidates. You’ll design new microservices—real\\-time ranking, interview analytics, and payouts that move millions of dollars—while pairing with senior engineers to profile, test, and harden our LLM\\-powered agents.

**You’ll thrive here if** 




 You have solid CS fundamentals and projects you’re proud to demo; you iterate fast—prototype, test, ship in days—and care as much about product polish as system performance. Curiosity about LLMs, retrieval, and ranking is a bonus; you’ll learn alongside engineers who have shipped at Jane Street, Citadel, Databricks, and Stripe.
