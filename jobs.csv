**We are** 
**Shape.Construction** 
**!**
 We are digitising the largest and most fundamental industry in the world, the industry that literally builds the foundations of the civilisation we all depend on to spare us from a brutal hunter\\-gatherer life: CONSTRUCTION
   

  

 It is one of the least digitised industries in the world but also the largest – 1 in 9 people globally work in the construction industry and it constitutes 11% of global GDP.
   

  

 Improving construction strengthens the very foundation of human civilisation. ( Watch our short film about it).
   

  

 We got our start as a high\\-end construction project management consultancy. As a consultancy, we are focused on genuinely upgrading the way construction projects are delivered. We then take the deep understanding of the projects we work on to develop construction management software products that anyone can use to deliver their projects better.
   

  

 We are building a full suite of products one module at a time – kind of like office 365 but for construction management. ( Check out Shape, our construction management tech and watch this video about what we are doing )
   

  

 The core of all this is our true secret sauce; people. We only recruit the very best both in capability and personality. We are deeply focused on designing a new type of organisation that is optimised for the flourishing of the people in the team first and foremost. People that join us develop fast as a whole person in ways they never imagined. ( Read more about our vision and mission ).
   

  

 This approach has allowed us to grow from just 2 people in 2017 to over 200 today (including consultancy) and we are still very much at the beginning! Joining us isn’t just some “job”, it is a transformative educational experience. We challenge you to be your best self in all aspects of life.
   

  

**Our vision is designed to align how we operate with the fundamental aspects that enable anyone to have a fulfilled life:**
* Connects us with meaningful relationships
* Inspires us to develop ourselves to become better humans
* Empowers us to pursue our own learning adventures

**The Role**
**Purpose of the role**
 We are currently looking for Senior Full Stack Software Engineers who are really interested in scaling our API and pushing the limits of what a ReactJS PWA (Progressive Web App) can do.
   

  

**Team**
 Our team is made up of experienced software engineers, product designers and product strategists. Together we will build the digital backbone of a construction organisation.
   

  

**Your top 3 objectives**
* Develop our React Native application on iOS \\& Android.
* Tweak our new application native code (Swift \\& Kotlin).
* Harden our test suite.


**Your Top 5 Responsibilities**
* Lead the development of our native applications, using React Native, Swift and Kotlin.
* Design and write efficient, reliable and reusable code using React Native, ReactJS and TypeScript.
* Understand and write Ruby code.
* Making tests a top priority in every development (TDD).
* Identifying bottlenecks, using tools to diagnose and refactor code.


**Your Capabilities**
 You are a skilled and empathic software engineer who thrives to build in integrity and quality, generating momentum and knowledge to the team and company.
   

  

 As a candidate, you should have:
   

  

* Mastery: Deep level of knowledge on the frameworks and tools used.
* Communication: Good communication is much more than saying the right thing. It is about communicating messages clearly and concisely. Ability to choose the best method of communication based on context, audience and urgency.
* Leadership: Can help colleagues achieve goals. Know how to share his / her knowledge and experience.
* Impact: Over\\-analysis or over\\-thinking can be as problematic as not analysing or not thinking. Ability to make decisions and take action.


**Nice to Have (If you don’t have it now you will after joining)**
* Mastery: Ability to write code with high level of simplicity and low level of complexity.
* Communication: Presents concerns, doubts or ideas publicly (speaking or writing) and with associated research (internal or external meetups, conferences).
* Leadership: Give us and others constructively critical feedback in order to continuously improve.
* Impact: Ability to drive change, generate knowledge and empower the team.


**Shape isn’t the place for you if any of the following is true:**
* You want an easy, chilled\\-out role without much challenge
* You like to be the smartest person in the room
* You don’t like continuously receiving honest candid feedback
* You prefer to do your own thing rather than work with a team


*At Shape we value diverse experiences and perspectives, empowering each member to contribute their unique expertise towards our collective success, so if you don't think you meet all the criteria but still are excited about this role we encourage you to apply anyways!*
 \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_
   

  

**Salary And Benefits**
**Standard Stuff**
* Competitive salary dependent on location and capability
* Paid Annual Leave 20 days \\+ statutory Bank Holidays
* In\\-House Coaching Sessions
* Discretionary bonus scheme for all team members.


**The Life\\-Changing Stuff**
* 4 Day Weeks : That’s right, 4 day weeks
* Flexibility: Getting things done is what really matters, not what time of day you do it. That means you don’t have to ask permission for things like picking up your kids or going to the doctor, just keep your team in the loop if you think they will be affected.
* Grow your whole self: Our leaders are more like coaches and one of our main objectives is to give 5 years’ worth of learning and development for every 1 year with us. You have a coach, mentor, well\\-being therapist and a development\\-orientated environment: That’s literally what our vision is all about and the primary reason Shape exists
* Be surrounded by the best: We only hire and retain the very best people. You might be used to being the smartest in the room but that won’t be the case in Shape. You will be surrounded by people you can learn from. We are 100% meritocratic so fast progression is the norm. You will be supported to excel in whichever areas you are most interested in! With Shape, development is unbounded
* Long\\-term impact: We are focused on solving the biggest issues in construction project delivery in a way that can spread and outlast us

**Application**
 We get thousands of applications so please write us a letter as part of your application explaining:
   

  

* Why do you want to join us?
* If you joined, where do you think you could make the most impact and how?


 We aren't a giant faceless corporation; we really care about the people who want to join our team so all applications will be read thoroughly by our key leaders.
   

  

 In terms of application, we usually start with an intro call to tell you what we are all about in a casual conversation.
