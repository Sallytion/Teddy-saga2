 Company: Basil Health \\& Brainwave Science 
 



 Location: Delhi / Hybrid 
 



 Experience: 2\\-6 Years 
 



**Overview** 




  






 Welcome to Basil Health — where Neuroscience meets Artificial Intelligence to redefine mental wellness. 
 




  






 We are a neurotechnology startup pioneering evidence\\-based, measurable mental well\\-being through EEG \\+ AI\\-powered insights into stress, focus, anxiety, and relaxation. Our mission is simple yet revolutionary: to make mental wellness measurable, personalized, and affordable — helping individuals and organizations cut costs on ineffective or unproven wellness programs. 
 




  






 By combining AI analytics, neuroscience, and biofeedback, Basil Health empowers people to understand what truly works for their mind, optimizing outcomes while reducing wasteful spending on generic wellness solutions. 
 




  






 Validated by global institutions such as the Indian Army, IIT Kanpur, IIT Mandi, the University of Maryland, and Michigan State University, Basil Health is building the next era of neurotech\\-driven, cost\\-efficient cognitive wellness. 
 




  





**About Basil Health** 




  






 We’re launching an innovative wellness product designed to help people live healthier, happier, and more balanced lives. This role offers a unique opportunity to shape the product’s story, craft its experiences, and introduce it to the world from day one. 
 




  





**Role Overview** 




 We are seeking a detail\\-oriented and technically strong Senior Software Quality Engineer to ensure end\\-to\\-end quality, reliability, and usability of the iCognative™ and CalmSync™ platforms, including Web, iOS, and Android applications. This role bridges software quality engineering, system validation, and real\\-world user experience to deliver stable, secure, and easy\\-to\\-use products. 
 



  





**Key Responsibilities** 



* Design and execute end\\-to\\-end (E2E) test plans for Web, iOS, and Android applications.
* Validate complete workflows including case creation, device pairing, EEG acquisition, analysis, and reporting.
* Test hardware–software integration including Bluetooth connectivity and recovery from failures.
* Verify correctness of cognitive test workflows including stimulus timing and sequencing.
* Perform functional, integration, regression, smoke, sanity, and exploratory testing.
* Validate data integrity across frontend, backend, and analytics pipelines.
* Perform API and backend testing including REST APIs, authentication, and data validation.
* Identify, document, and track defects with clear reproduction steps and root\\-cause analysis.
* Collaborate with frontend, backend, R\\&D, and data science teams to resolve issues.
* Support UAT, pilot deployments, and field testing.
* Ensure ethical compliance and secure handling of sensitive data.
* Mentor junior QA engineers and contribute to release readiness decisions.



  





**Required Qualifications** 



* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, or related field.
* 2\\+ years of experience in software quality engineering or system validation.
* Hands\\-on experience testing Web and Mobile (Android/iOS) applications.
* Experience with test automation frameworks such as Playwright, Selenium, or Appium.
* Experience with API and backend testing (REST, authentication, data validation).
* Understanding of CI/CD pipelines and quality gate enforcement.
* Strong defect analysis, debugging, and documentation skills.
* Ability to think in end\\-to\\-end user workflows and anticipate real\\-world failure scenarios.
* Strong communication skills and ability to work cross\\-functionally.



  





**Nice to Have** 



* Basic understanding of EEG, biosignals, or neurotechnology concepts.
* Experience testing hardware\\-integrated or wearable devices.
* Exposure to regulated or sensitive domains (law enforcement, defense, healthcare).
* Scripting knowledge (Python or JavaScript) for test utilities.
* Experience supporting field deployments or user acceptance testing (UAT).



  





**What This Role Is NOT** 




 This is not a pure manual testing role and not a neuroscience research position. The role requires ownership of system\\-level quality and production readiness. 
 



  





**What Success Looks Like** 



* Stable end\\-to\\-end test execution with no critical production defects.
* Consistent behavior across Web, Android, and iOS platforms.
* Smooth operator experience with minimal support dependency.
* Reduced field issues related to connectivity, usability, and workflow errors.
* High confidence from engineering and leadership in release quality.



  





**Why Join Brainwave Science?** 




 You will work at the intersection of software engineering, neuroscience, and AI, contributing to the reliability of advanced cognitive technology platforms. 
 



  





**How to Apply**
