Career\\-defining work.
   

  

 Lots of tech companies disrupt. But, many fail when they try to scale. We're different. CockroachDB makes it easier for companies to build and scale apps. This is how and why we're helping some of the most innovative companies on the planet. We tackle problems head\\-on and focus on solutions that create lasting impact.
   

  

 Because when our customers win, we all win.
   

  

* The Role


 Databases must keep going no matter what. At Cockroach Labs, quality is our number one feature. We are software engineers on a mission to push our product to new frontiers. Our work has a broad\\-reaching impact on the engineering organization of over 100 engineers who rely on our tools and methodology to ship a top\\-notch quality product.
   

  

 Test Engineering is expanding our investment in next\\-generation test automation and bug\\-finding techniques, utilizing both randomized and deterministic testing. Note that this is not a QA/manual testing role; all Cockroach Labs engineers write tests and obsess about quality. Test Engineering is a cross\\-functional team that aims to enable and strengthen the engineering organization by emphasizing correctness and performance testing.
   

  

 The work encompasses three primary focus areas: Test Infrastructure, Exploratory Testing, and Performance and Scalability. Speaking broadly, Test Infrastructure enables automated test execution, detection of performance regressions, fuzzing, and much more. Exploratory Testing enables new bug\\-finding techniques such as static and dynamic analysis, metamorphic testing, failure injection, and others. Performance and Scalability enables at\\-scale benchmarking.
   

  

**Some Examples Of Recent And Future Projects**
* Mixed version framework utilizing roachtest and roachprod
* Failure injection testing (e.g., chaos\\-mesh, frisbee)
* Next generation of roachtest and roachperf
* Parallelized automated microbenchmarks via roachprod\\-bench
* Developing a static analysis framework for concurrency bugs
* Large\\-scale benchmarking and performance testing
