**About The Team**
 The Data Engineering \\& Integrations team, a key part of the Enterprise Data Services Organization, is dedicated to building and operating the technology solutions that power our data\\-driven decisions. We design robust architectures and software to manage data from various sources, establishing clear processes for channeling, storing, and using this information. Our work is foundational, leveraging cloud and local databases, as well as advanced techniques in AI, ML, and big data. We're not just about building; we're also about maintaining integrity and compatibility, continuously reviewing requirements to ensure our systems are up\\-to\\-date and future\\-proof.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As the Manager of Data Engineering \\& Integrations, you will lead a dynamic and growing team of data engineers. We're currently focused on expanding our use of modern data platforms like Databricks and Snowflake to significantly enhance our data capabilities. You will be at the forefront of this effort, responsible for crafting, developing, and implementing innovative data integration, data warehouse, and data mart solutions. This is a unique opportunity to work on high\\-priority initiatives that combine new and existing technologies to deliver exceptional results for our customers and employees.
   

  

 Key Responsibilities
   

  

* Lead and mentor a team of data engineers, fostering a culture of innovation, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
* Define and drive the architectural vision for our data platforms, ensuring scalability, reliability, and security across all solutions.
* Design and implement high\\-level data strategies and roadmaps to support business growth and improve our product experience.
* Oversee the development and optimization of our data pipelines and infrastructure, with a focus on modern technologies like Databricks and Snowflake.
* Champion best practices in data governance, quality, and lifecycle management.
* Collaborate with cross\\-functional teams to understand data needs, translate business requirements into technical solutions, and enable data\\-driven insights
* Drive the adoption of automation and CI/CD principles to enhance the efficiency and reliability of our data operations.


**About You**
 Basic Qualifications:

**Our Approach to Flexible Work**
 With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in\\-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in\\-office each week, we simply
 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
