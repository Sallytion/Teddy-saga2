 MongoDB’s mission is to empower innovators to create, transform, and disrupt industries by unleashing the power of software and data. We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry\\-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi\\-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build and run applications anywhere—on premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 new developers signing up to use MongoDB every month, it’s no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next\\-generation, AI\\-powered applications.
   

  

 Application Modernization Platform (“AMP”) is a MongoDB offering that modernizes our customers’ legacy relational applications to a modern architecture, platform, and stack underpinned by MongoDB using a combination of software, processes, and engineers. In this offering, the people and software are inextricably linked and cannot be separated. AMP delivery teams consist of application delivery engineers and a project manager who work onsite with the customer to modernize one or more of the customer’s applications in an accelerated timeframe. Our delivery teams leverage a mix of AI and deterministic custom tooling to expedite application delivery.
   

  

 MongoDB has various AMP delivery teams globally, supported by a small, central, non\\-customer\\-facing unit: the AMP Delivery Excellence team. This team elevates delivery effectiveness by developing and implementing the Application Transformation Framework (ATF), MongoDB's standardized process for modernizing applications. The team also creates tools to systematically track project delivery effectiveness, pinpointing inefficiencies that then drive product engineering and process improvements. Utilizing this data, the team collaborates with MongoDB’s internal Product Engineering team to shape the AMP product roadmap based on identified needs. Furthermore, the team uses AI to develop and evolve simulation applications that mimic common customer modernization challenges, helping to clearly identify product gaps and test the new features implemented by the Product Engineering team to address them.
   

  

 As a critical member of the AMP Delivery Excellence team, the Practice Engineer will help innovate, build, and evolve the team's core assets and initiatives, collaborating closely with peers and the Technical Program Manager. This role partly involves working as a software developer in an Agile environment, innovating on solutions for specific challenges that help to evolve the AMP practice.
   

  

 This role will be based in Gurgaon or Bangalore under our flexible working model, and you will often be collaborating with stakeholders in other regions and time zones.
