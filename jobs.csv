* Investigate SaaS design and data models and translate them to security graphs consumed by the SPM product. Study API design, hardening manuals and security best practices to discover the essential security caveats of the target applications.
* Find novel solutions to provide visibility, security, compliance and remediation tools for enterprise SaaS application environments.
* Explore different threat vectors for cloud services.
* Support multiple stakeholders such as engineering, research, product management, customer success, and customer support teams as a domain expert.
* Public writing and presentation opportunities, such as publishing articles, blogs or papers in relevant conferences.
* Mentor, coach and lead a team of researchers to write detections that are of high quality.


**Required Skills And Experience**
* 8 years of InfoSec experience required. Strong preference for candidates with a proven track record in SaaS security environments.
* Experience implementing or managing security posture platforms (CSPM/DSPM/ASPM), with a understanding of the cloud security ecosystem
* Experience from security analysis work, enterprise SaaS deployment hardening duties or from security content development.
* Proficient enough in scripting language ( Python, Shell ) of one’s choice to be able to solve technical problems with code.
* Proven track record in managing public cloud security alongside a understanding of enterprise security frameworks.
* Mature analytical mindset for security product development. Strong merits include experience in greenfield/novel product development, API\\-driven automation and advanced programming capabilities.


**Additional Skills**
 To perform this duty successfully, a candidate ideally has the following non\\-technical skills:
   

  

* Great written and verbal communication skills.
* Fast learning skills, intuitiveness and creativity. Comfortable working in unknown domains.
