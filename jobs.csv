**About The Department**
 Cloudflare’s Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles large amounts of requests on the Internet today.

Individual engineering teams are typically responsible for large areas with considerable impact, and able to execute autonomously within that space to deliver value to their customers \\- be they internal or external.
   

  

**About The Team And The Role**
 The Engineering Platform and Productivity team has a charter to build a self\\-service, resilient, and scalable platform using a combination of Open Source projects, intellectual property, and internal infrastructure. The charter includes to build tools and services that help easily integrate a base set of capabilities into Cloudflare’s products. These services have cross cutting concerns that 100s of fellow engineers use as the building blocks at Cloudflare. The team also writes services that are redundant for each product development team to build and that serve high volumes of requests every day.
   

  

 As an engineer in the Engineering Productivity and Platforms organization, you'll be building and managing tools to help engineers deploy and operate the services that make Cloudflare work. Our mission is to provide a reliable, yet flexible, platform to help product teams release new software efficiently and safely. The role includes both software engineering and DevOps operational responsibilities. The ideal candidate will care deeply about providing other engineers with an excellent development experience.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Design and build developer productivity tooling including MCP servers and agents.
* Drive initiatives that make our engineers happier and more productive.
* Help respond and prevent incidents impacting core platforms.
* Harden the platform against security threats and resource contention issues.
* Improve our GitOps systems and practices.
* Work with app teams to understand their potential challenges and help them choose the best way to architect their systems.


**Desirable Skills, Knowledge And Experience.**
* Ability to work with codebases in Bash, TypeScript and Go.
* Excellent debugging skills.
* Source control experience including branching, merging and rebasing.
* The ability to break down complex problems into smaller pieces, provide options, talk through trade\\-offs and drive the effort to solve the problem.


**Bonus Points**
* Providing guidance and building platforms across multiple zones and regions as foundation for other teams to build distributed highly\\-available applications.
* Worked in a platform engineering team/ engineering productivity team in the past.


**What Makes Cloudflare Special?**
 We’re not just a highly ambitious, large\\-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large\\-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.
   

  

**Project Galileo** 
 : Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers\\-\\-at no cost.
   

  

**Athenian Project** 
 : In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.
   

  

**1\\.1\\.1\\.1** 
 : We released 1\\.1\\.1\\.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy\\-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use \\- it is the first consumer\\-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal \\- we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
