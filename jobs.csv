* Proven experience designing and operating scalable systems (service design, API contracts, databases, caching, queues, failure modes).
* Strong engineering rigor: testing, code quality, performance tuning, security\\-minded development, and operational readiness.
* Experience working effectively with cross\\-functional stakeholders and delivering in iterative milestones.



**Bonus Points** 
   
 


* Experience with distributed systems at scale (event\\-driven architecture, message queues, idempotency, retries, rate limiting).
* Experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure), containers, and orchestration (Docker/Kubernetes).
* Strong knowledge of databases (SQL/NoSQL), data modeling, and performance optimization.
* Experience building internal platforms/frameworks that improve developer productivity.
* Familiarity with experimentation and analytics instrumentation for measuring product impact.
* Experience integrating AI/ML\\-powered capabilities or third\\-party APIs into product workflows.

* Familiarity with RAG patterns (embeddings, vector databases, retrieval, chunking) and grounding strategies to improve factuality and relevance.
* Understanding of latency/cost tradeoffs for AI features (caching, batching, streaming, model selection, fallbacks) and building reliable AI workflows.
* Experience with LLM observability and evaluation tooling (tracing, automated evals, human feedback loops) and monitoring quality regressions over time.
* Exposure to responsible AI practices (privacy, data minimization, prompt injection risks, content safety, policy compliance).
