 Tasket, is a radically reimagined task management platform built to “Make Humanity more productive”. Tasket goes beyond managing tasks to managing momentum, and is built for teams and companies that want to execute faster. Where most tools
 *capture* 
 work, Tasket’s promise is to:
 


1. Keep tasks moving \\- no idle time
2. Keep progress visible \\- no silent work
3. Keep context complete \\- no tool\\-hopping
4. Keep the system clean \\- no entropy



 Traditional task platforms behave like databases: optimized for capture and customization, not throughput. Tasket behaves like an operating system: opinionated, fast, and designed to keep execution flowing.
 



 Tasket is founded by Bhavin Turakhia, Co\\-Founder of Radix, Titan and Zeta. We are a lean team of opinionated craftsmen, who sweat the details. We are unique in how we work and believe in the following:
 


* **Maniacal Urgency** 
 \\- Move with relentless speed. Find non\\-obvious shortcuts. Innovate not just in product, but in execution speed.
* **Agents as Peers** 
 \\- Agents as collaborators in the workflow, taking on real work alongside humans.
* **In\\-person over Remote** 
 \\- Default to being co\\-located. Learning loops are tighter, iterations are faster, and decisions take minutes.
* **Delete aggressively** 
 \\- If it isn’t high\\-impact, it doesn’t belong. We cut ruthlessly—features, process, and anything that adds drag.
* **Frontline Generals, not Backseat Managers** 
 \\- Leadership means owning outcomes from the trenches. We stay close to the work, the users, and the details that matter

* **Passionate Problem Solver:** 
 Revel in solving challenges, collaborating with developers and QA Engineers, and driving automation and Continuous Integration efforts.
