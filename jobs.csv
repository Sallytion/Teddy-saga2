* 2\\+ years of experience with Kubernetes, preferably as someone who managed the Infrastructure and deployments


**You are comfortable working with new cloud technologies and learning new skills**
* You understand that AI is not a fad, and can improve your workflow, from coding to automating tasks

 At Kyndryl, we design, build, manage and modernize the mission\\-critical technology systems that the world depends on every day. So why work at Kyndryl? We are always moving forward – always pushing ourselves to go further in our efforts to build a more equitable, inclusive world for our employees, our customers and our communities.
   

  

**The Role**
 As a IDAA Systems Programmer at Kyndryl are project\\-based subject matter experts in all things infrastructure – good at providing analysis, documenting and diagraming work for hand\\-off, offering timely solutions, and generally “figuring it out.” This is a hands\\-on role where your feel for the interaction between a system and its environment will be invaluable to every one of your clients.
   

  

 There are two halves to this role: First, contributing to current projects where you analyze problems and tech issues, offer solutions, and test, modify, automate, and integrate systems. And second, long\\-range strategic planning of IT infrastructure and operational execution. This role isn’t specific to any one platform, so you’ll need a good feel for all of them. And because of this, you’ll experience variety and growth at Kyndryl that you won’t find anywhere else.
   

  

 You’ll be involved early to offer solutions, help decide whether something can be done, and identify the technical and timeline risks up front. This means dealing with both client expectations and internal challenges – in other words, there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference, and a lot of people will witness your contributions. In fact, a frequent sign of success for our Infrastructure Specialists is when clients come back to us and ask for the same person by name. That’s the kind of impact you can have!
   

  

 Key Responsibilities:
   

  

* IDAA Installation \\& Management: Install, configure, and maintain IDAA using tools like GUI Management Console, Data Studio, and Admin Services.
* Data Synchronization: Manage and troubleshoot Db2\\-IDAA data sync for optimized query performance.
* IDAA Loader Administration: Install, configure, and maintain IDAA Loader for efficient data processing.
* Storage \\& Performance Optimization: Reallocate storage, improve system efficiency, and prevent slow SQL queries.
* System Administration: Perform admin tasks using Putty and Unix System Services (USS).
* Upgrades \\& Maintenance: Conduct IDAA loader and system maintenance upgrades to ensure stability and security.


 This is a project\\-based role where you’ll enjoy deep involvement throughout the lifespan of a project, as well as the chance to work closely with Architects, Technicians, and PMs. Whatever your current level of tech savvy or where you want your career to lead, you’ll find the right opportunities and a buddy to support your growth. Boredom? Trust us, that won’t be an issue.
   

  

 Your future at Kyndryl
   

  

 There are lots of opportunities to gain certification and qualifications on the job, and you’ll continuously grow as a Cloud Hyperscaler. Many of our Infrastructure Specialists are on a path toward becoming either an Architect or Distinguished Engineer, and there are opportunities at every skill level to grow in either of these directions.
   

  

**Who You Are**
 You’re good at what you do and possess the required experience to prove it. However, equally as important – you have a growth mindset; keen to drive your own personal and professional development. You are customer\\-focused – someone who prioritizes customer success in their work. And finally, you’re open and borderless – naturally inclusive in how you work with others.
   

  

**Required Technical And Professional Experience**
* 7\\+ Yrs Experience in IBM Db2 Analytics Accelerator (IDAA) to manage, optimize, and maintain the system.
* Strong expertise in DB2 database administration and IDAA installation \\& optimization.
* Experience with query acceleration, performance tuning, and storage management.
* Proficiency in IDAA data synchronization and loader management.
* Knowledge of Putty, Unix System Services (USS), and mainframe environments (z/OS).
* Ability to troubleshoot performance bottlenecks and optimize complex SQL queries.
* DB2 \\& IDAA Expertise – Proven experience in IDAA installation, configuration, and query optimization.
* Familiarity with SMP/E installation, storage reallocation, and system security.
* Ability to diagnose and resolve performance bottlenecks affecting query execution.
* Exposure to IBM Infosphere Data Replication (CDC) for IMS.


**Preferred Technical And Professional Experience**
* Experience with Omegamon, IBM Control Center, and Tivoli monitoring tools.
* Knowledge of disaster recovery planning and IDAA system upgrades.
* Familiarity with automation scripting for monitoring and issue resolution.


**Being You**
 Diversity is a whole lot more than what we look like or where we come from, it’s how we think and who we are. We welcome people of all cultures, backgrounds, and experiences. But we’re not doing it single\\-handily: Our Kyndryl Inclusion Networks are only one of many ways we create a workplace where all Kyndryls can find and provide support and advice. This dedication to welcoming everyone into our company means that Kyndryl gives you – and everyone next to you – the ability to bring your whole self to work, individually and collectively, and support the activation of our equitable culture. That’s the Kyndryl Way.
   

  

**What You Can Expect**
 With state\\-of\\-the\\-art resources and Fortune 100 clients, every day is an opportunity to innovate, build new capabilities, new relationships, new processes, and new value. Kyndryl cares about your well\\-being and prides itself on offering benefits that give you choice, reflect the diversity of our employees and support you and your family through the moments that matter – wherever you are in your life journey. Our employee learning programs give you access to the best learning in the industry to receive certifications, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Skillsoft, and many more.
