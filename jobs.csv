 We are seeking a Support Engineer to help customers integrate and adopt Ethos Design System (EDS).
   

  

 The Support Engineer for EDS is the first line of technical enablement for our adopting teams. You are a developer who loves to solve problems. Working within a cross\\-functional team of Architects, LSD (Lead System Designers), Developers, and DevOps, you assist product teams in debugging their integration issues, creating code samples, and proving that EDS works in their environment. You do not just answer questions; you build the ""proof of concepts"" (POCs) that give teams the confidence to adopt our platform
   

  

**Job Description**
**About EDS**
 EDS is the unified digital platform that powers GE HealthCare’s global software portfolio. It serves as a comprehensive library of reusable UI components, design patterns, and accessibility standards that bridge the critical gap between User Experience (UX) and Engineering. By fostering a philosophy of ""reduce, reuse, and recycle,"" EDS enables hundreds of product teams to eliminate redundant coding and design work. We provide the foundational building blocks that ensure our clinical and operational applications are intuitive, consistent, and accessible, allowing teams to focus on patient safety.
   

  

**The Mission: Scale and Empowerment**
 We are in a phase of hyper\\-growth, scaling from 15 adopting products to over 100\\. This requires a leader who thinks like a founder. You must look beyond simple backlog management to think about scale, growth, and empowerment. You will build a self\\-service ecosystem that allows teams to move fast without breaking the consistent standards required for patient safety and accessibility.
   

  

**Core Responsibilities**
* Integration Assistance \\& Debugging
* Technical Guidance: Assist customers in integrating EDS components into their applications. You troubleshoot ""real world"" implementation issues, often debugging code in React or Angular environments to find the root cause .
* Defect Resolution: Collaborate with the core development team to fix defects found by customers. You don't just report bugs; you help fix them and verify the solution .
* Cross\\-Framework Validation: Validate that components behave correctly across multiple frameworks (React, Angular). You ensure that a component works as well in a legacy Angular app as it does in a modern React one .
* Prototyping \\& Enablement
* Rapid Prototyping: Develop quick proof\\-of\\-concepts (POCs) using BrowserStack or AI\\-assisted tools to demonstrate how to use EDS components to solve specific UI challenges .
* Documentation: Write integration guides, FAQs, and ""How\\-To"" articles . You translate complex technical behaviors into clear instructions that allow customers to help themselves.
* Cross\\-Functional Collaboration
* Team Ecosystem: Work daily within a cross\\-functional team comprising Architects, LSD (Lead System Designers), Developers, and DevOps. You bring the customer's perspective to technical discussions.
* Code Quality: Participate in code reviews and contribute to the maintenance of the EDS codebase. You ensure that the fixes and features you implement meet the team's high quality standards .


**Key Competencies \\& Soft Skills**
* Customer Service Mindset: You treat internal developers as valued customers. You approach every ticket with empathy, patience, and a genuine desire to help them succeed .
* Critical Thinking \\& Problem Solving: You do not just apply ""band\\-aid"" fixes. You investigate the root cause of issues, asking probing questions to understand why an integration is failing before offering a solution .
* Communication Skills: Excellent written and verbal communication. You can explain complex technical concepts to non\\-technical stakeholders and keep customers updated on the status of their requests without using jargon .
* Organization Skills: Ability to manage a queue of competing priorities. You are highly organized, ensuring that no ticket falls through the cracks and that every customer receives a timely response.


**Qualifications**
* Experience: 3–5 years of experience in front\\-end development and technical support engineering .
* UX Collaboration: Mandatory: 3\\+ years of experience working with UX Designers. You must be comfortable bridging the gap between design specs and technical implementation.
* Technical Stack:
+ Mandatory: Strong proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML5, and CSS3 .
+ Mandatory: Familiarity with Lit for Web Component development .
+ Preferred: Hands\\-on experience with BrowserStack for cross\\-browser testing .

This position gives you complete control of an AI product from start to finish: weekly customer meetings, product decision\\-making, and production deployments. Your dual mandate: drive Kayako One to resolve support tickets autonomously and construct an AI sales pipeline that moves prospects from initial contact through deal closure. You own the technology stack, product roadmap, release schedule, and business results.
   

  

 The wider industry isolates engineers from end users behind layers of ""process."" That's not our approach. No chain of product managers, designers, or customer success teams stands between you and ground truth. You will lead weekly discovery sessions, convert customer pain into working features, deploy rapidly, and track tangible outcomes. You will also create the AI sales automation framework that may serve as the blueprint for Trilogy's portfolio\\-wide go\\-to\\-market motion. Here, your performance is measured by adoption metrics, resolution rates, CSAT scores, and pipeline velocity.
   

  

 This role means full ownership: new AI capabilities in Kayako One that improve ticket resolution; platform integrations with CRM and ticketing systems; outreach sequences and targeting rules; pipeline connections; analytics that validate impact; plus deployment, monitoring, and on\\-call responsibilities to maintain uptime. This is not a backend\\-only position executing specs handed down from others, nor a comfortable lane with neat handoffs. You'll code as the work demands, configure AWS infrastructure with confidence, adopt tools like Voiceflow or Cursor without friction, and make LLMs reliable in production—not just impressive in demos.
   

  

 You'll operate at the sharp edge of our help desk product and a high\\-priority AI sales automation initiative, with visibility across the portfolio. Success means customers actively using your releases, shorter resolution times, improved end\\-user satisfaction, and a more efficient, faster\\-moving sales pipeline. If you want to own measurable outcomes, engage customers every week, filter out distractions, and ship what actually moves metrics, this is your role.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Develop and deploy Kayako One capabilities—AI\\-driven ticket resolution improvements, CRM and ticketing platform integrations, scalable and dependable infrastructure, plus performance optimizations and defect fixes.
* Conduct weekly customer discovery sessions to convert user pain points into feature requirements and confirm product direction with actual users.
* Create the AI sales automation infrastructure—outreach sequences, pipeline and tool integrations, automated progression through sales stages, and metrics dashboards.
* Manage deployments and operations—end\\-to\\-end releases, monitoring/alerting/incident handling, and AWS/database administration.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* This isn't simply coding against a specification someone else prepared — you define what gets built based on direct customer feedback.
* This isn't work that remains in pre\\-production environments — your code reaches production and serves live customers.
* This isn't a narrowly scoped specialty role — you are accountable for the complete stack, underlying infrastructure, and user experience.


**Technical Lead Key Responsibilities**
* Develop and sustain an AI\\-powered customer support system that handles tickets without human intervention
* Develop and sustain a complete AI sales pipeline that moves opportunities from initial contact through closing


**Basic Requirements**
* At least 5 years of professional software development experience
* Experience owning entire products or major systems, not just features
* Experience shipping AI/LLM\\-powered products to production (not just prototypes or demos)
* Deep AWS experience, including Lambda, S3, OpenSearch, RDS, CloudWatch, EventBridge, EC2, Route 53, CloudFront
* LLM/AI integration experience, including Claude/ChatGPT prompt engineering, API integration
* Experience coding in Python, Java, and JavaScript
* Experience using MySQL database
* Experience using Docker, deployment pipelines, and GitHub workflows
* Experience with OpenAI and JWT API development
* Experience with DNS management and web infrastructure
* Customer\\-facing experience
