 of experience building large\\-scale, distributed systems in
 **high\\-compliance or high\\-integrity domains** 
 (HR, Payroll, FinTech, or Insurance).
* Deep expertise in

 ,
 **data modeling** 
 , and
 **compliance\\-first architecture** 
 .

* Proficiency in designing
 **extensible, modular service boundaries** 
 that maintain
 **auditability and backward compatibility** 
 .
* Strong understanding of
 **policy enforcement, rule engines, and event\\-driven systems** 
 .
* Ability to translate
 **legal and operational complexity** 
 into
 **elegant, maintainable engineering abstractions** 
 .
* A
 **hands\\-on architectural leader** 
 who can set technical direction, mentor teams, and drive large\\-scale transformations sustainably.



**Bonus Points**



* Experience with
 **compliance\\-as\\-code** 
 or
 **policy automation** 
 frameworks.
* Exposure to
 **global employment** 
 ,
 **EOR** 
 , or
 **multi\\-country workforce** 
 systems.
* Familiarity with
 **event sourcing** 
 ,
