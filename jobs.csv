**Company:** 
 Revenue Optics
 



**Location:** 
 India (Remote\\-Work from Home)
 



**Type:** 
 Full\\-Time
 



**Hiring Window:** 
 45\\-Day Selection Period
 



**Time Zone Requirement:** 
 Daily overlap with U.S. Eastern Time
 



  





**About Revenue Optics** 




 Revenue Optics is a
 **U.S.\\-based sales transformation and growth engineering firm** 
 serving B2B distributors and private\\-equity\\-backed industrial companies.
 



 We design and implement:
 


* Inside sales and outbound coverage models
* Revenue operations and CRM architecture
* Sales analytics and executive dashboards
* AI\\-enabled sales automation
* Go\\-to\\-market strategy and segmentation
* Sales, RevOps, and analytics team build\\-outs



 Our clients operate at
 **real enterprise scale** 
 with urgent commercial mandates: accelerate organic growth, improve sales productivity, and modernize revenue infrastructure.
 



 We are now entering a
 **major scale phase** 
 and are building our
 **founding execution team in India** 
 to support delivery across consulting, data, RevOps, automation, and strategy.
 



  





**Who This Role Is For** 




 This opportunity is designed for:
 


* High\\-performing early\\-career professionals who have already built real systems or products
* Mid\\-career operators who feel underutilized in slow, hierarchical environments
* Builders who want
 **global exposure, faster responsibility, and direct linkage to business outcomes**



  





 This is not a narrow single\\-role posting.
 



 It is a
 **general founding team build across multiple functional tracks** 
 .
 



**If You’ve Been Passed Over, This Is Your Reset** 




 This role will resonate if you have ever:
 


* Been passed over because of
 **politics instead of performance**
* Been boxed in by
 **tenure\\-based promotion systems**
* Been slowed down by
 **layers of management and approval cycles**
* Consistently outperformed peers without receiving real scope or authority



  





 Many high\\-caliber operators become
 **caged talent** 
 in traditional organizations—capable of far more than their title or environment allows. Here, there is no political ladder to climb.
 



 There is only
 **execution, impact, and accountability** 
 .
 



 If you’ve ever felt like you were built for more—but never truly got your shot—
 **this is that shot.** 




  





**What You’ll Work On** 




 Depending on your background, you may contribute across:
 


* 📊 Data \\& Analytics – reporting, KPI frameworks, SQL/Python pipelines, executive dashboards
* ⚙️ Revenue Operations – CRM architecture, funnel design, GTM workflows
* 🤖 Automation \\& AI – sales automation, copilots, workflow orchestration
* 🧠 Strategy \\& Market Intelligence – segmentation, ICP modeling, whitespace analysis
* 🎨 Creative \\& Client Enablement – presentations, sales tools, storytelling systems
* 🚀 Execution \\& Operations – implementation, client delivery, internal systems



  





 All work is:
 


* Client\\-facing
* Outcome\\-driven
* Tied directly to revenue, productivity, or growth performance



  





**Why This Is a High\\-Acceleration Opportunity** 



* You will work directly with
 **U.S.\\-based senior operators and former enterprise executives**
* You will gain exposure to:
* Private equity portfolio environments
* National distributor growth strategies
* Modern sales and RevOps architectures
* Your work will be deployed across
 **multiple real client environments**
* Growth is
 **performance\\-based, not tenure\\-based**



  





**Here, output outranks tenure. Performance creates authority—fast.** 




**Execution speaks louder than credentials. If you can build, you belong—degree or not.** 




**Time Zone \\& Availability (Non\\-Negotiable)** 




 You must be able to:
 


* Maintain daily overlap with U.S. Eastern Time
* Work live with U.S. clients and leadership
* Support real\\-time execution and delivery



**What You’ll Be Accountable For** 



* Owning deliverables end\\-to\\-end
* Turning ambiguity into execution
* Shipping high\\-quality work under real deadlines
* Tying your work to business outcomes (revenue, efficiency, adoption, margin)
* Operating with high autonomy and accountability



  





**Core Expectations** 




**Across all tracks:** 



* Extreme ownership
* Bias toward action
* Clear written communication
* Comfort working with minimal hand\\-holding
* High personal performance standards



**Functional experience may include (not all required):** 



* Data: SQL, Python, Power BI, analytics engineering
* RevOps: CRM, GTM systems, routing, reporting
* Automation: APIs, workflows, AI copilots
* Strategy: segmentation, ICP modeling, business analysis
* Creative: Figma, presentation systems, visual storytelling



  





**What This Is Not** 




 This is not a fit for:
 


* Candidates seeking rigid schedules
* People who require heavy task\\-level management
* Those optimizing primarily for low\\-pressure environments
* Anyone unable to commit to U.S. Eastern Time overlap



  





**Recent Graduates \\& Interns** 




 We do consider exceptional early\\-career talent.
 



 Formal education matters less than
 **demonstrated execution** 
 . You should be able to show:
 


* Products you built
* Dashboards you shipped
* Automations you deployed
* Freelance or startup work
* Revenue or operational impact



 If your experience is limited to coursework only, this role is likely not the right fit at this time.
 



  





**45\\-Day Hiring Window** 




 This is a
 **general call for elite talent** 
 .
 



 We will be actively reviewing candidates over the next
 **45 days** 
 as we prepare for a significant team build\\-out. This is not a single hire—this is a
 **founding cohort expansion**
