**About The Role**
 We’re looking for an
 **early\\-career software engineer** 
 who loves to build, learn, and ship. This isn’t a role where you’ll just “write tickets.” You’ll join a small, empowered product team and contribute directly to real features that reach thousands of users.
   

  

 We care more about
 **what you’ve built** 
 than where you’ve worked. Personal projects, open\\-source contributions, or side apps matter as much as your degree. If you’re curious, self\\-motivated, and want to learn how great products are made — this is for you.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Build real features: Write production code in Angular and TypeScript that users actually touch.
* Learn the full stack: Get hands\\-on experience with AWS Lambda, Java/Node.js, and CI/CD pipelines.
* Collaborate cross\\-functionally: Work with product managers and designers to solve user problems, not just technical tasks.
* Experiment and iterate: Use feature flags (GrowthBook, LaunchDarkly, etc.) to safely ship and learn.
* Grow your craft: Participate in code reviews, pair programming, and mentorship sessions with senior engineers.
* Show initiative: Bring your ideas and projects to life — we value builders and problem\\-solvers.


**What You Bring**
* Bachelor’s degree (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field.
* Strong English communication — clear writing and willingness to ask good questions.
* Solid understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Exposure to Angular, React, or any modern front\\-end framework.
* Curiosity about AWS Lambda or serverless architectures.
* Demonstrated passion through personal projects, hackathons, open\\-source work, or side apps.
* Willingness to learn, experiment, and take ownership of your growth.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience deploying projects to AWS, Vercel, or Cloudflare.
* Familiarity with GitHub Actions or other CI/CD automation tools.
* Some backend exposure — Java (Spring Boot) or Node.js.
* Basic understanding of feature flags or A/B testing.
* Contributions to open\\-source projects or a portfolio on GitHub.


**How We Work**
 We believe in
 **empowered product teams** 
 — small, autonomous groups of engineers, designers, and PMs who own outcomes, not tasks.
   

  

 You’ll learn to think like a
 **product engineer** 
 — balancing technical quality, user needs, and business value.
   

  

 We’ll invest in your
 **growth, autonomy, and mastery** 
 — and expect you to bring energy, curiosity, and craftsmanship every day.
   

  

**You’re a Fit If You…**
* Love building things that people actually use.
* Learn fast and take initiative — you don’t wait to be told what to do.
* Care about writing clean, thoughtful code. See mistakes as part of progress.
* Want to grow into a product\\-minded engineer, not just a coder.

**About The Role**
 We’re looking for an
 **early\\-career software engineer** 
 who loves to build, learn, and ship. This isn’t a role where you’ll just “write tickets.” You’ll join a small, empowered product team and contribute directly to real features that reach thousands of users.
   

  

 We care more about
 **what you’ve built** 
 than where you’ve worked. Personal projects, open\\-source contributions, or side apps matter as much as your degree. If you’re curious, self\\-motivated, and want to learn how great products are made — this is for you.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Build real features: Write production code in Angular and TypeScript that users actually touch.
* Learn the full stack: Get hands\\-on experience with AWS Lambda, Java/Node.js, and CI/CD pipelines.
* Collaborate cross\\-functionally: Work with product managers and designers to solve user problems, not just technical tasks.
* Experiment and iterate: Use feature flags (GrowthBook, LaunchDarkly, etc.) to safely ship and learn.
* Grow your craft: Participate in code reviews, pair programming, and mentorship sessions with senior engineers.
* Show initiative: Bring your ideas and projects to life — we value builders and problem\\-solvers.


**What You Bring**
* Bachelor’s degree (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field.
* Strong English communication — clear writing and willingness to ask good questions.
* Solid understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Exposure to Angular, React, or any modern front\\-end framework.
* Curiosity about AWS Lambda or serverless architectures.
* Demonstrated passion through personal projects, hackathons, open\\-source work, or side apps.
* Willingness to learn, experiment, and take ownership of your growth.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience deploying projects to AWS, Vercel, or Cloudflare.
* Familiarity with GitHub Actions or other CI/CD automation tools.
* Some backend exposure — Java (Spring Boot) or Node.js.
* Basic understanding of feature flags or A/B testing.
* Contributions to open\\-source projects or a portfolio on GitHub.


**How We Work**
 We believe in
 **empowered product teams** 
 — small, autonomous groups of engineers, designers, and PMs who own outcomes, not tasks.
   

  

 You’ll learn to think like a
 **product engineer** 
 — balancing technical quality, user needs, and business value.
   

  

 We’ll invest in your
 **growth, autonomy, and mastery** 
 — and expect you to bring energy, curiosity, and craftsmanship every day.
   

  

**You’re a Fit If You…**
* Love building things that people actually use.
* Learn fast and take initiative — you don’t wait to be told what to do.
* Care about writing clean, thoughtful code. See mistakes as part of progress.
* Want to grow into a product\\-minded engineer, not just a coder.

 Posting Statement
   

  

 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Working with the world’s leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, multilinguality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and leveraging that work to build real\\-world AI systems that solve mission\\-critical priorities for companies.
 



  





**Role Overview:** 




 This position is within a project with one of the foundational LLM companies. The goal is to assist these foundational LLM companies in enhancing their Large Language Models.
 



  





 One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high\\-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine\\-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.
 



  





 For example, in the case of Agent Completion (AC) data generation, your task will be to simulate high\\-quality multi\\-turn conversations between a user and a smart assistant that utilizes function\\-calling tools to accomplish user goals. You will craft these dialogues by playing both the assistant and the user, while simulating tool use where necessary to guide the assistant through complex decision\\-making and real\\-world reasoning scenarios.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day look like:** 



* Design multi\\-turn conversations that simulate real interactions between users and AI assistants using apps like calendar, email, maps, and drive.
* Emulate both the
 **user** 
 and the
 **assistant** 
 , including the assistant's tool calls (only when corrections are needed).
* Carefully select when and how the assistant uses available tools, ensuring logical flow and proper usage of function calls.
* Craft dialogues that demonstrate natural language, intelligent behavior, and contextual understanding across multiple turns.
* Generate examples that showcase the assistant’s ability to gracefully complete feasible tasks, recognize infeasible ones, and maintain engaging general chat when tools aren’t required.
* Ensure all conversations adhere to defined formatting and quality guidelines, using an internal playbook.
* Iterate on conversation examples based on feedback to continuously improve realism, clarity, and value for training purposes.
* Collaborate with peers and reviewers to maintain consistency and high standards in deliverables.



  





**Requirements:** 



* Strong general
 **technical reasoning skills** 
 and the ability to model real\\-world assistant behavior using tool\\-based APIs.
* Ability to break down complex tasks and simulate realistic dialogues that reflect user expectations and assistant limitations.
* Experience in
 **any programming language or tech stack** 
 is acceptable; a strong grasp of APIs, data formats (e.g., JSON), and logical thinking is more critical than specific toolsets.
* Excellent written communication skills in English, with a focus on clarity, tone, and instructional coherence.
* Creativity and attention to detail in crafting realistic scenarios and responses.
* Experience working with or around LLMs, virtual assistants, or function\\-calling frameworks is a plus.
* Ability to follow detailed guidelines and formatting standards with high consistency.
* 3\\+ years of overall professional experience in a technical or analytical field.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing:** 



* Work in a fully remote environment.
* Opportunity to work on cutting\\-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.



  





**Offer Details:** 



* **Commitments Required** 
 : At least 4 hours per day and minimum 20 hours per week with overlap of 4 hours with PST. (We have 3 options of time commitment: 20 hrs/week, 30 hrs/week or 40 hrs/week)
* **Engagement Type** 
 : Contractor assignment (no medical/paid leave)
* **Duration of Contract** 
 :
 **6 Weeks**
