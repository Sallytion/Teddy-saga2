**About Schedit** 




 Schedit is a cloud\\-based workforce management platform on a mission to transform how businesses handle their most complex operational challenge: scheduling. We're building intuitive, efficient, and beautiful experiences that streamline operations, compliance, and reporting across industries. As we gear up for our 2025 launch, we're assembling a founding engineering team that will define our technical culture and build the foundation for years to come.
 



  
 



 This is your chance to be part of the zero\\-to\\-one journey—where every line of code matters, every architectural decision shapes the future, and every team member has outsized impact.
 



  





**About the Role** 




 We're seeking a Full Stack Engineer who will lead our Android development while contributing across our entire technology stack. This is a unique opportunity to own the end\\-to\\-end delivery of our Android application while being part of a broader engineering ecosystem. You'll work closely with our Senior Mobile Engineering Lead (who drives our iOS platform) and contribute to backend systems when needed.
 



  
 



 This isn't a role confined to just mobile development—you'll think full\\-stack, write production code across Android and backend services, and have the autonomy to shape both our mobile experience and the systems that power it. As we scale, this role has a clear path to technical leadership, with the opportunity to build and mentor a world\\-class mobile engineering team.
 



  





**What You'll Own** 



* **Android Platform Leadership** 
 : Take full ownership of our Android application from architecture to deployment, ensuring a best\\-in\\-class mobile experience
* **Mobile\\-First Development** 
 : Build native Android applications using Kotlin and Java, leveraging modern Android architecture components and best practices
* **Product Launch Execution** 
 : Drive the successful delivery of our Android application to support our 2025 launch plans—ship fast, iterate based on user feedback, and maintain high quality
* **Full Stack Contribution** 
 : Contribute to backend services (Java\\-based) as needed, understanding the full journey from API to UI
* **Technical Excellence** 
 : Establish mobile development standards, testing strategies, and CI/CD pipelines that enable rapid, reliable releases
* **Cross\\-Platform Collaboration** 
 : Work closely with iOS development to ensure feature parity, shared learnings, and consistent user experiences



  





**What You Bring** 




*Must\\-Haves* 



* **5\\-6 years** 
 of software engineering experience with strong Android development expertise
* **Native Android mastery** 
 : Deep proficiency in Kotlin and Java with production Android applications at scale
* **Modern Android stack** 
 : Hands\\-on experience with Jetpack Compose, Android Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData, Room), Coroutines, and Flow
* **Backend familiarity** 
 : Comfortable working with backend systems and APIs—bonus if you've written production Java/Kotlin backend code
* **Mobile architecture expertise** 
 : Strong understanding of MVVM, Clean Architecture, or similar patterns; you know when to apply them and when to keep it simple
* **API integration** 
 : Experience building robust mobile apps that consume RESTful APIs, handle offline scenarios, and manage state effectively
* **Performance optimization** 
 : You've profiled apps, optimized rendering, reduced memory footprint, and shipped apps that feel fast
* **Testing expertise** 
 : Strong experience with testing mobile applications and comfortable writing automation tests (Unit tests, Integration tests, UI tests with Espresso/UI Automator)
* **Ownership mindset** 
 : You've taken features from concept to production, handled releases, monitored crashes, and iterated based on user feedback



  





*Bonus Points for* 



* Experience with cross\\-platform frameworks like Flutter
* Experience with dependency injection frameworks (Dagger/Hilt, Koin)
* Knowledge of reactive programming and modern concurrency patterns
* Hands\\-on experience with Gradle build optimization and modularization
* Familiarity with mobile CI/CD tools (Fastlane, Bitrise, GitHub Actions)
* Experience integrating third\\-party SDKs and native platform features
* Previous work on workforce management, scheduling, or business productivity apps
* Contributions to open\\-source Android projects or technical writing
* Experience with backend frameworks (Spring Boot, Ktor) and cloud services (AWS)
* Previous startup experience, especially in 0→1 product launches



  





**What Success Looks Like** 



* **Product Delivery** 
 : You ship the Android application on time with quality that makes users love it
* **Technical Craftsmanship** 
 : Your code is clean, testable, and well\\-architected; your PRs are examples for the team
* **Ownership \\& Initiative** 
 : You don't wait for specifications—you collaborate with product, ask the right questions, and drive clarity
* **Full Stack Thinking** 
 : You understand the entire system, from backend APIs to UI interactions, and optimize the whole experience
* **Velocity \\& Reliability** 
 : You balance speed with stability—shipping quickly while maintaining app performance and crash\\-free rates
* **Team Collaboration** 
 : You actively share knowledge with the iOS team and backend engineers, fostering a culture of learning



  





**This Role is For You If** 



* You get excited about building mobile experiences from scratch and seeing them in users' hands
* You believe in owning outcomes, not just features—you care about app metrics, user feedback, and business impact
* You're comfortable working across the stack and don't see backend contributions as ""not my job""
* You thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy learning from a Senior Mobile Engineering Lead
* You want to be the go\\-to Android expert while staying versatile and full\\-stack capable
* You see mobile development as more than UI work—it's about architecture, performance, and user delight
* You want agency and direct impact on product direction, not just executing handed\\-down requirements



  





**This Role is NOT For You If** 



* You prefer working exclusively on mobile apps with no backend involvement
* You need highly detailed product specs and extensive hand\\-holding before starting
* You're looking for a large team with specialized roles—this is a startup where everyone wears multiple hats
* You're uncomfortable with the pace, ambiguity, and iteration cycles of early\\-stage product development
* You prefer iOS over Android or want to work equally across both platforms (we have dedicated iOS leadership)
* You're looking for work\\-life separation rather than work\\-life integration



  





**What We Offer** 



* **Competitive Compensation** 
 : As a startup we offer reasonable salary that recognizes senior expertise
* **Impact** 
 : Your app will directly affect thousands of businesses and their employees
* **Remote\\-First Team**
