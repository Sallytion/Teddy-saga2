 At Microsoft, we believe in empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Join us, and help ensure our customers data is always safe, resilient, and ready for the future. Imagine this: You log into work on a Monday morning, and the code you wrote last week is already protecting petabytes of customer data across the globe. A new feature you designed is being used by Fortune 500 enterprises to keep their business running even when disaster strikes. Every commit you make has the potential to safeguard critical workloads for millions of users.
   

  

 This is not just another engineering role — this is your chance to build the platform that protects the cloud itself.
   

  

 The Azure Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) team is building a next\\-generation data protection and resiliency platform. With data volumes crossing into exabytes, we’re at the cutting edge of distributed storage and cloud resiliency. Our mission is to ensure every workload — VMs, containers, databases, file servers, blobs, and PaaS services — can be protected, restored, and trusted by our customers. We’re designing for massive scale with a multitenant, microservices\\-based architecture and generalized data store. This is an opportunity to shape a system that will be the foundation of Azure’s reliability story for years to come.
   

  

 What your journey will look like \\- In your first few months, you’ll dive deep into high\\-scale distributed storage systems, learning from some of the best engineers in the industry. You’ll own services end\\-to\\-end — designing, coding, testing, deploying, and operating — while seeing firsthand how your work runs in production. You’ll partner with teams across Azure to deliver seamless integrations and ensure data resiliency across the platform. Every sprint, you’ll tackle new challenges: making services faster, more durable, more secure, and more cost\\-efficient. You’ll live the “customer\\-obsessed, live\\-site first” culture, where solving real customer problems is as exciting as shipping new features.
   

  

 Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As employees we come together with a growth mindset, innovate to empower others, and collaborate to realize our shared goals. Each day we build on our values of respect, integrity, and accountability to create a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive at work and beyond.

You will take the lead in developing scalable microservices and streaming data infrastructure to handle high\\-throughput workloads with minimal latency. This role requires deep expertise in distributed systems and real\\-time data processing (ideally in the programmatic advertising domain) to ensure our systems remain highly performant and reliable. You’ll work closely with product managers, data scientists, and other engineering teams to translate business needs into technical solutions and ensure the platform is fast, fault\\-tolerant, and observable.
 *This role is based in the United States and can be performed remotely, with a preference for candidates who can join us in a hybrid capacity in San Francisco, New York, or Atlanta.* 




  
 



**Responsibilities:** 



* System Architecture \\& Development: Lead the design and implementation of scalable, high\\-performance backend services, including microservices and APIs, that can efficiently handle large volumes of requests with low latency. Ensure the architecture accommodates real\\-time bidding and personalization use cases common in AdTech.
* Streaming Data Infrastructure: Develop and maintain streaming data pipelines and event\\-driven systems to process and analyze continuous data flows in real time (e.g., using Apache Kafka). Optimize data ingestion and processing for timeliness and accuracy to support downstream analytics and machine\\-learning models.

Implement robust fault\\-tolerance mechanisms and optimize for low\\-latency response times in a high\\-concurrency environment. Leverage observability best practices (comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing) to enable engineers to quickly analyze system behavior and take proactive measures to boost performance and reliability.
* Cross\\-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with cross\\-functional teams – including Product, Data Science, DevOps, and Frontend – to translate business requirements into scalable technical solutions. Facilitate effective communication and collaborative problem\\-solving to deliver new features and improvements that align with our product roadmap.
* Technical Leadership \\& Mentorship: Provide technical leadership within the engineering team without direct managerial duties. Guide and mentor junior engineers through code reviews, design discussions, and best practice adoption, fostering a culture of technical excellence and continuous improvement.
* Technical Strategy \\& Innovation: Stay abreast of emerging technologies and industry trends (e.g. new AWS services, streaming frameworks, database technologies) and evaluate their potential benefit to our platform. Contribute to the technical roadmap, making build\\-vs\\-buy recommendations and driving innovation to keep our systems ahead of the curve.



  
 



**Required Qualifications:** 



* 8\\+ years of software engineering experience building backend systems, with 3\\+ years in a senior or lead role (e.g. Staff Engineer, Principal Engineer) in the AdTech or a similar high\\-volume, low\\-latency domain.
* Proven track record in designing and building high\\-throughput, low\\-latency distributed systems that operate at scale (e.g. handling thousands of requests per second or more).
* Expertise in microservices architecture and distributed system design, including experience decomposing monoliths or building greenfield microservices with well\\-defined APIs.
* Proficiency in Java and Go for backend development, and experience with Python for scripting, automation, or data processing tasks.
* Hands\\-on experience with streaming data technologies and event\\-driven frameworks, such as Apache Kafka (or AWS Kinesis), and possibly stream processing frameworks (Spark Streaming, Flink, or similar, experience with Apache Kafka is highly desired).
* Strong experience with cloud platforms (AWS preferred) and deploying services in a cloud\\-native environment. Familiarity with AWS components like EC2, S3, Lambda, SNS/SQS, etc., and ability to design cost\\-effective, performant cloud architectures.
* Experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases for high\\-volume applications. Comfortable with technologies like PostgreSQL/MySQL as well as key\\-value or wide\\-column stores (e.g. DynamoDB, Cassandra, Redis) for caching and fast lookups.
* Familiarity with containerization and orchestration tools (Docker, Kubernetes) and CI/CD pipelines to build and deploy microservices reliably.
* Deep understanding of system observability and monitoring – experience instrumenting applications and using monitoring/logging tools to ensure visibility into system performance (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack or similar).
* Excellent problem\\-solving and communication skills. Ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly to cross\\-functional team members and stakeholders. Proven collaboration skills in an agile development environment.








**Preferred Qualifications:** 



* Domain Expertise: Deep knowledge of the programmatic advertising ecosystem, including how Demand\\-Side Platforms (DSPs), Supply\\-Side Platforms (SSPs), ad exchanges, and real\\-time bidding (RTB) work together. Prior experience building or optimizing components of a DSP or ad server is a strong plus.
* High\\-Scale Data Processing: Experience designing systems that operate at extreme scale, such as real\\-time auction systems or high\\-frequency trading platforms, and optimizing algorithms for latency and throughput (e.g. understanding of auction theory or bidding optimization strategies).
