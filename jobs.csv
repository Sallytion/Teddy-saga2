* Collaborate cross\\-functionally with design (HIG\\-aligned, accessible UX), product (metrics\\-driven roadmaps), platform/backend (API design), and data/ML (model integration, offline strategies).
* Champion quality: write unit/UI tests (XCTest/XCUITest), snapshot tests, contract tests, and maintain reliable CI/CD (e.g., Xcode Cloud, GitHub Actions).
* Ensure reliability and observability: logging (os.log), analytics, crash/perf monitoring (MetricKit, Crashlytics), feature flags, and remote config.
* Security \\& privacy by design: Keychain, App Attest/DeviceCheck, encryption at rest/in transit, data minimization.
* Ship confidently via TestFlight and the App Store, with compliance for data usage and privacy.


**Minimum Qualifications**
* 7\\+ years of professional iOS experience; 3\\+ years building and shipping products at scale.
* Expert in Swift, Swift Concurrency (async/await, structured concurrency), SwiftUI, Combine, SPM.
* Strong grasp of iOS app architecture, modular codebases, and SOLID principles.
* Proficient with XCTest/XCUITest, Instruments (Time Profiler, Allocations, Leaks, Energy), and MetricKit.

* Data persistence: Core Data/SwiftData, lightweight migrations, background contexts.
* Security: Keychain, App Transport Security, App Attest, secure coding patterns.
* Excellent communication; comfortable driving technical decisions end\\-to\\-end.


**Tech Stack You’ll Use**
* Language \\& UI: Swift 5\\.x\\+, SwiftUI (navigation stacks, modifiers, previews), UIKit interop where needed
* Concurrency \\& FRP: async/await, Task, actors, Sendable types, Combine
* Data \\& Storage: SwiftData / Core Data, SQLite, background tasks, App Groups, FileProvider
* Performance \\& Observability: Instruments, os\\_log/os\\_signpost, MetricKit, Crashlytics, Firebase Analytics (optional)
* Networking: URLSession (async), WebSockets, reachability, HTTP/2, ETags, incremental backoffs
* Build/Release: Xcode, SPM, Xcode Cloud/GitHub Actions, TestFlight, App Store Connect
* Security \\& Privacy: Keychain, App Attest/DeviceCheck, Secure Enclave usage patterns, data minimization, privacy manifests
* Tooling: SwiftLint/SwiftFormat, Danger.
