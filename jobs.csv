 Urban Company started as UrbanClap in November 2014, when its founders, Abhiraj, Raghav, and Varun, realized that the home services industry was predominantly unorganized, fragmented, and offline. Customers found it challenging to avail quality services conveniently, and service professionals were struggling to make ends meet, having to rely upon several middlemen, contractors, and local aggregators. The founders felt that the industry was ripe for disruption, and launched Urban Company, with three key principles in mind\\-
 



  





 1\\. Customer love: Build a platform that offers truly delightful and differentiated services
 



 2\\. Partner empowerment: Build a deep, full\\-stack partnership with service partners, helping improve their earnings and overall livelihood

**Why Work With Us?** 




  





 ● Be part of building high\\-scale infrastructure powering hundreds of microservices.
 



 ● Tackle challenging business problems with simple, scalable solutions.
