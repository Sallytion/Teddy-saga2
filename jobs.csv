But unlike software (with observability platforms such as AppDynamics and Datadog), construction teams lack automated feedback loops to help projects stay on schedule and on budget. Without this observability, construction wastes a whopping $3T per year because glitches aren’t detected fast enough to recover.
   

  

 Doxel AI exists to bring computer vision to construction, so the industry can deliver what society needs to thrive. From hospitals to data centers, from foreman to VPs of construction, teams use Doxel to make better decisions everyday. In fact, Doxel has contributed to the construction of the facilities that provide many of the products and services you use everyday.
