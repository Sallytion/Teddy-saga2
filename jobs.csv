Our team designs, builds, and manages large\\-scale distributed systems that empower both customers and
 



 internal teams to better understand and improve security posture.
 



  





 You will operate at the intersection of big data, distributed computing, cloud technologies, and infrastructure as code. Our existing stacks include both
 



 custom\\-built and open source components written in Python, Go, or Java, deployed within Amazon Web Services. We leverage Kubernetes and other
 



 containerized platforms. Major components include Kafka, Elasticsearch, Databricks, and Spark, along with additional custom application services
 



 developed in\\-house.
 



 In this role, you will provide technical leadership across initiatives, influence architectural direction, and ensure our platform scales reliably and sustainably

**What You'll Do: Shape the Way the World Understands Data**
 At Teradata, we're not just managing data; we're unleashing its full potential. Our ClearScape Analytics™ platform and pioneering Enterprise Vector Store are empowering the world's largest enterprises to derive unprecedented value from their most complex data. We're rapidly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Artificial Intelligence, especially in the exciting realm of
 **autonomous and agentic systems**
 We’re building intelligent systems that go far beyond automation — they observe, reason, adapt, and drive complex decision\\-making across large\\-scale enterprise environments. As a member of our AI engineering team, you’ll play a critical role in designing and deploying advanced AI agents that integrate deeply with business operations, turning data into insight, action, and measurable outcomes.
   

  

 In this role, you’ll architect foundational components for production\\-grade AI systems — from agent frameworks and LLM pipelines to observability and evaluation layers that ensure reliability, accountability, and performance. You’ll be responsible not just for building models, but for making them measurable, debuggable, and trustworthy in real\\-world, high\\-stakes deployments.
   

  

 You’ll work alongside a high\\-caliber team of AI researchers, engineers, and data scientists tackling some of the hardest problems in AI and enterprise software — from scalable multi\\-agent coordination and fine\\-tuned LLM applications, to real\\-time monitoring, drift detection, and closed\\-loop retraining systems.
   

  

 If you're passionate about building intelligent systems that are not only powerful but observable, resilient, and production\\-ready, this role offers the opportunity to shape the future of enterprise AI from the ground up.
