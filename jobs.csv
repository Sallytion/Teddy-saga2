 THE MISSION — READ THIS OR DON’T BOTHER
 



  





 We're building a B2B HR tech product from ZERO to REVENUE in 30 days.
 



 If that sentence doesn't make your heart race, close this tab now.
 



 This isn't a data science course. This is a startup battlefield. We're taking 2–3 absolutely insane AI/ML builders who want to experience what it actually takes to ship real AI in a real product.
 



  





 WE'RE NOT OFFERING:
 


* Money (we're broke founders too)
* Clean, tidy datasets
* Academic research time
* Guarantees of any kind



  





 WE'RE OFFERING:
 


* Real scars from building under impossible deadlines
* Actual product AI experience — not Kaggle notebooks
* Portfolio that proves you can ship AI that actually works
* Stories you'll tell for years about that time you built predictive HR tech from scratch
* Potential equity if you survive and want to keep going



  





 THE INSANE PLAN
 



 PHASE 1: BATTLE MODE (Days 1–30\\)
 



 Goal: Deploy a working prediction model in production
 


* Week 1: Find messy HR data → clean it → label it
* Week 2: Train \\& fail → train again → fail better
* Week 3: Get something that works 70% of the time → ship it
* Week 4: Watch real users interact with your model → cry → fix it



  





 PHASE 2: SURVIVAL MODE (Months 2–3\\)
 



 Goal: Make the model actually useful
 


* Collect real feedback from actual companies
* Improve accuracy with messy, real\\-world data
* Build monitoring so you know when it breaks (it will break)



  





 PHASE 3: GROWTH MODE (Months 4–6\\)
 



 Goal: Scale or die trying
 


* Optimize for speed and scale
* Build pipelines that don't require manual babysitting
* Either we make it or we learn why we didn't



  





 WHAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY DO
 



 No bullshit tasks. You'll be:
 


* Cleaning the ugliest, messiest HR datasets you've ever seen
* Labeling data at 2 AM because we need it for training tomorrow
* Working with pre\\-trained models and making them work for our problem
* Training basic models that actually predict attrition risk
* Deploying to production and watching your model fail in real\\-time
* Talking to actual HR teams about why your predictions work (or don't)



  





 NON\\-NEGOTIABLE AI/ML STACK
 



 Core Skills (You Must Know This):
 


* Python (pandas, numpy, scikit\\-learn)
* Data cleaning \\& preprocessing (the messy reality)
* Working with pre\\-trained models
* Basic model training \\& evaluation
* Git/GitHub



  





 Battlefield You'll Enter (You Will Learn This):
 


* ML Ops basics (deployment, monitoring)
* Building prediction pipelines that don't break
* Rule\\-based AI \\+ ML hybrids for talent risk scoring
* Labeling strategies for noisy business data



  





 WHO WE WANT
 



 The AI/ML Commandos:
 


* People who see ""messy data"" as a personal challenge
* Builders who'd rather have a 70% accurate model in production than a 95% accurate model in a notebook
* Humans who don't need perfect datasets to start building
* Those who understand that ""AI in production"" means ""constantly fixing things""



  





 Minimum Battle Requirements:
 


* Basic knowledge of Python ML stack (pandas, scikit\\-learn)
* Experience cleaning and preprocessing real datasets
* Worked with pre\\-trained models (even just using them)
* Basic model training experience (can train a simple classifier)
* Comfort with Git/GitHub
* Reliable availability (\\~15–20 hours/week for 6 months)
* Communication skills to explain why your model failed



  





 Nice\\-to\\-Have (But Not Required):
 


* Experience labeling datasets
* Basic knowledge of neural networks
* Familiarity with any cloud ML services
* Experience with any ML deployment



  





 SELECTION PROCESS
 



 Step 1: Prove You're Crazy
 



 Show us a project where you worked with messy data and built something that worked
 



 Step 2: Battle Test
 



 We'll give you a messy dataset and 48 hours to clean it and build a basic prediction model
 



 Step 3: Reality Check
 



 We'll tell you exactly how hard this will be. If you're still interested, you're in.
 



  





 THE HARD TRUTH
 



 This will be the hardest 6 months of your AI/ML life. You will:
 


* Work with the messiest HR data imaginable
* Deal with constantly changing business requirements
* Build models that fail spectacularly
* Question your life choices multiple times per week
* Probably not sleep enough



  





 But you'll also:
 


* Learn more about real\\-world ML in 6 months than most learn in 2 years
* Build a portfolio that shows you can ship AI that actually works
* Understand what it actually takes to put ML in production
* Either help build something amazing or learn why it failed



  





 HOW TO APPLY
 



 If you're still reading this and thinking ""hell yes"":
 



 Send your GitHub (or portfolio) and a one\\-paragraph explanation of why you're crazy enough to do this to \\[email].
 



  





 Application deadline: When we find 3 insane AI/ML builders.
 



  





 ""If you're not embarrassed by your first model, you deployed too late.""
 



  





 — Someone who probably had cleaner data than we will
