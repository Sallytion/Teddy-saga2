 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""
