**Role Description**
****What Will You Do?****
* Design, develop, and test software components used by automotive dealerships to interact with their customers.
* Lead the design, build, and integration of AI/ML solutions, including:
* 
+ Developing and consuming LLM APIs.
+ Training, fine\\-tuning, and deploying models into production systems.

* Collaborate directly with business stakeholders—including customers—to understand requirements and deliver impactful solutions.

* Mentor and review the work of SDE I engineers, helping them grow in technical expertise.
* Take initiative to improve overall system architecture, scalability, and reliability.
* Exercise ownership by challenging trade\\-offs between speed and reliability when building solutions (“pulling the Andon cord”).


**Education \\& Experience**
- 2–5 years of experience developing cloud\\-based software services with a strong understanding of design for scalability, performance, and reliability.

- 2\\+ years of hands\\-on experience deploying and optimizing AI/ML solutions in production environments.

- Education: BTech or Equivalent 4yr degree in Computer Science/Engineering (Tier 1/Tier 2 institutes such as IIT/NIT preferred, but not required).

- Skills:

- 

- Proficiency in at least one modern programming language (Java, Python, or C\\#).

- Understanding of data structures, algorithms, and design principles.

- Strong communication skills for working with technical and non\\-technical teammates.

- Curiosity and eagerness to learn new tools, frameworks, and architectures.

- Operating system and networking fundas

- AI/ML Fundas:

- 

- Data \\& ML Lifecycle

- 

* Core Concepts: Can clearly explain the purpose and importance of train/validation/test splits.
* Data Intuition: Understands ""garbage in, garbage out."" Can discuss the conceptual importance of data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation.
* Evaluation: Can explain the purpose of common metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision/recall, loss). Can look at a training/validation loss curve and identify clear overfitting or underfitting.


- Neural Networks (NNs)

- 

* Core Concepts: Can intuitively explain the basic components of a neural network (neurons, layers, weights, activation functions) and their purpose.
* Training Dynamics: Understands, at a high level, how a network ""learns"" via loss functions, gradient descent, and backpropagation.
* Practical Intuition: Can conceptually differentiate between training and inference and is familiar with core issues like overfitting and underfitting.


- Transformers

- 

* Motivation: Understands the motivation for the Transformer architecture (e.g., the limitations of sequential models like RNNs/CNNs for long\\-range dependencies).
* \\*Core Mechanics: Can intuitively explain the purpose of key components like self\\-attention, positional encodings, and the encoder\\-decoder structure.
* \\*Attention Intuition: Grasps the basic idea of self\\-attention (how a model learns which words are important to each other) and multi\\-head attention (looking at a sequence in different ""ways"").


- Large Language Models (LLMs)

- 

* \\*Architecture \\& Scaling: Understands the relationship between Transformers and LLMs and is aware of concepts like scaling laws and the pre\\-training/fine\\-tuning paradigm.
* Practical Pipeline: Familiar with the concepts of tokenization (how text is processed) and prompt\\-based interaction.
* Application Concepts: Aware of core application patterns like Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the idea of LLM\\-based agents.
* Responsible AI: Recognizes model limitations (e.g., hallucinations) and understands the importance of responsible AI, safety, and model interpretability.
* Nice to have
