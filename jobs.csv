 What You’ll Do
   

  

* Build and own AI\\-backed features end to end, from ideation to production — including layout logic, smart cropping, visual enhancement, out\\-painting and GenAI workflows for background fills
* Design scalable APIs that wrap vision models like BiRefNet, YOLOv8, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, ControlNet, etc., into batch and real\\-time pipelines.
* Write production\\-grade Python code to manipulate and transform image data using NumPy, OpenCV (cv2\\), PIL, and PyTorch.
* Handle pixel\\-level transformations — from custom masks and color space conversions to geometric warps and contour ops — with speed and precision.
* Integrate your models into our production web app (AWS based Python/Java backend) and optimize them for latency, memory, and throughput
* Frame problems when specs are vague — you’ll help define what “good” looks like, and then build it
* Collaborate with product, UX, and other engineers without relying on formal handoffs — you own your domain****
 What You’ll Need
   

  

* 2–3 years of hands\\-on experience with vision and image generation models such as YOLO, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, Stable Diffusion, VITON, or TryOnGAN — including experience with inpainting and outpainting workflows using Stable Diffusion pipelines (e.g., Diffusers, InvokeAI, or custom\\-built solutions)
* Strong hands\\-on knowledge of NumPy, OpenCV, PIL, PyTorch, and image visualization/debugging techniques.
* 1–2 years of experience working with popular LLM APIs such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and how to compose multi\\-modal pipelines
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
* Experience solving real\\-world visual problems like object detection, segmentation, composition, or enhancement.
* Ability to debug and diagnose visual output errors — e.g., weird segmentation artifacts, off\\-center crops, broken masks.
* Deep understanding of image processing in Python: array slicing, color formats, augmentation, geometric transforms, contour detection, etc.
* Experience building and deploying FastAPI services and containerizing them with Docker for AWS\\-based infra (ECS, EC2/GPU, Lambda).
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
* A customer\\-centric approach — you think about how your work affects end users and product experience, not just model performance
* A quest for high\\-quality deliverables — you write clean, tested code and debug edge cases until they’re truly fixed
* The ability to frame problems from scratch and work without strict handoffs — you build from a goal, not a ticket


 Who You Are
   

  

* You’ve built systems — not just prototypes
* You care about both ML results and the system’s behavior in production
* You’re comfortable taking a rough business goal and shaping the technical path to get there
* You’re energized by product\\-focused AI work — things that users feel and rely on
* You’ve worked in or want to work in a startup\\-grade environment: messy, fast, and impactful


 What You Get
   

  

* Full autonomy over your problem space
* A builder\\-first, no\\-handoff culture
* Remote\\-first flexibility (India preferred)
* Base \\+ Variable \\+ meaningful equity
* A product shipping to some of the world’s most recognizable brands

 What You’ll Do
   

  

* Build and own AI\\-backed features end to end, from ideation to production — including layout logic, smart cropping, visual enhancement, out\\-painting and GenAI workflows for background fills
* Design scalable APIs that wrap vision models like BiRefNet, YOLOv8, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, ControlNet, etc., into batch and real\\-time pipelines.
* Write production\\-grade Python code to manipulate and transform image data using NumPy, OpenCV (cv2\\), PIL, and PyTorch.
* Handle pixel\\-level transformations — from custom masks and color space conversions to geometric warps and contour ops — with speed and precision.
* Integrate your models into our production web app (AWS based Python/Java backend) and optimize them for latency, memory, and throughput
* Frame problems when specs are vague — you’ll help define what “good” looks like, and then build it
* Collaborate with product, UX, and other engineers without relying on formal handoffs — you own your domain****
 What You’ll Need
   

  

* 2–3 years of hands\\-on experience with vision and image generation models such as YOLO, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, Stable Diffusion, VITON, or TryOnGAN — including experience with inpainting and outpainting workflows using Stable Diffusion pipelines (e.g., Diffusers, InvokeAI, or custom\\-built solutions)
* Strong hands\\-on knowledge of NumPy, OpenCV, PIL, PyTorch, and image visualization/debugging techniques.
* 1–2 years of experience working with popular LLM APIs such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and how to compose multi\\-modal pipelines
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
* Experience solving real\\-world visual problems like object detection, segmentation, composition, or enhancement.
* Ability to debug and diagnose visual output errors — e.g., weird segmentation artifacts, off\\-center crops, broken masks.
* Deep understanding of image processing in Python: array slicing, color formats, augmentation, geometric transforms, contour detection, etc.
* Experience building and deploying FastAPI services and containerizing them with Docker for AWS\\-based infra (ECS, EC2/GPU, Lambda).
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
* A customer\\-centric approach — you think about how your work affects end users and product experience, not just model performance
* A quest for high\\-quality deliverables — you write clean, tested code and debug edge cases until they’re truly fixed
* The ability to frame problems from scratch and work without strict handoffs — you build from a goal, not a ticket


 Who You Are
   

  

* You’ve built systems — not just prototypes
* You care about both ML results and the system’s behavior in production
* You’re comfortable taking a rough business goal and shaping the technical path to get there
* You’re energized by product\\-focused AI work — things that users feel and rely on
* You’ve worked in or want to work in a startup\\-grade environment: messy, fast, and impactful
