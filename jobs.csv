 Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.
   

  

 In\\-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in\\-office workdays.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Notion is a company of toolmakers. To build the best tools for our users, we need the best tools for ourselves.
   

  

 You'll join a new team dedicated to building and improving Admin Mode—Notion's internal platform used by hundreds of employees across Customer Experience, Trust \\& Safety, Engineering, and other teams. Admin Mode is critical infrastructure and it's accessed daily by teams supporting millions of Notion users. You'll take ownership of a platform that directly impacts the productivity of every team at Notion.
   

  

**You'll Directly Impact**
* Notion's entire operational efficiency as the company scales
* Customer Experience agents who rely on Admin Mode to support users
* Trust \\& Safety teams protecting Notion users from abuse and security threats
* Every engineering team that uses admin tools to debug and resolve issues


**What You'll Achieve**
* Rebuild the foundation: Redesign Admin Mode's UI/UX to consolidate scattered workflows, reduce time\\-to\\-resolution for user issues, and make critical tools discoverable and fast.
* Own reliability: When Admin Mode goes down, customer support grinds to a halt—you'll make sure it doesn't.
* Enable extensibility: Build standardised APIs, permission testing utilities, and scaffolding that lets any team quickly add new admin tools.
* Build tools: Collaborate cross\\-functionally with internal teams to transform ambiguous problem statements into tools that streamline their workflows.


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Tech stack: Node.js/TypeScript and React/TypeScript
* 5\\+ years of experience leading and contributing to full stack applications working with cross\\-functional stakeholders.
* You care about internal tools. You understand that developer experience and operational efficiency aren't nice\\-to\\-haves—they're force multipliers. You get excited about shaving 20 seconds off a workflow that runs 80 times per day.
* You have deep empathy for users. You'll be building for Customer Experience agents resolving 50\\+ tickets daily, Trust \\& Safety investigators handling time\\-sensitive cases, and engineers debugging production issues at 2am. Understanding their workflows matters as much as the code.
* You're a systems thinker. Admin Mode touches user accounts, workspace data, billing, security, and more. You need to think through permissions, audit trails, and edge cases—not just ship features fast.
* You collaborate across teams. 90% of Admin Mode tools are owned by different engineering teams. You'll need to build consensus, establish standards, and communicate changes that affect deeply ingrained workflows.


**Nice To Haves**
* Having worked with LLMs and build real world applications.
* Familiarity with TypeScript, Node.js, React


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

 At DevRev, we’re building the future of work with
 **Computer** 
 – your AI teammate.
   

  

 Computer is not just another tool. It’s built on the belief that the future of work should be about genuine human connection and collaboration – not piling on more apps.
   

  

 Computer is the best kind of teammate: it amplifies your strengths, takes repetition and frustration out of your day, and gives you more time and energy to do your best work.
   

  

 How?
   

  

 Easy: it’s the only platform capable of…
   

  

**Complete data unification**
 Most AI products focus on either structured data (like CRM records and support tickets), or unstructured data (like documents and emails). Computer AirSync connects everything, unifying all your data sources (like Google Workspace, Jira, Notion) into one AI\\-ready source of truth: Computer Memory.
   

  

**Powerful search, reasoning, and action**
 Once connected to all your tools and apps, Computer is embedded in your full business context. It can find and summarize, sure. Even more impressive: it offers employees insights, strategic and proactive suggestions, plus powerful agentic actions.
   

  

**Extensions for your teams and customers**
 Computer doesn’t make you choose between new software and old. Its AI\\-native platform lets you extend existing tools with sophisticated apps and agents.
