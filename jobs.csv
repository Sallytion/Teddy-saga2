 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

**About Pixxel**
 Pixxel is a space data company and spacecraft manufacturer redefining Earth observation with hyperspectral imaging. The company’s first three commercial hyperspectral satellites—Fireflies—deliver imagery at 5\\-meter resolution and 135\\+ spectral bands, providing 50x richer detail than traditional Earth observation systems and unlocking insights across agriculture, climate, energy, environment, and more.
   

  

 Once fully deployed, Pixxel’s constellation of 18\\-24 satellites will capture imagery across up to 250 bands in VNIR and SWIR ranges, with a 40 km swath and daily global revisit capability. Pixxel’s most unique strength is its full\\-stack approach, integrating every layer of the value chain from satellite hardware and manufacturing to AI\\-powered analytics.
   

  

 Pixxel’s satellite constellation is complemented by Aurora, its in\\-house Earth Observation Studio that simplifies satellite imagery analysis and democratises remote sensing for all. Designed to make hyperspectral data more accessible, Aurora by Pixxel combines high\\-frequency imagery with AI\\-powered tools to generate actionable insights, even for users without technical backgrounds. The third pillar of Pixxel’s ecosystem is its in\\-house satellite manufacturing capability. Beyond building its own spacecraft, Pixxel also provides satellite systems and subsystems to other organisations. This dual capacity sets it apart in a sector where most companies focus on either payload design or data operations, but not both.
   

  

 Pixxel’s team is young but deeply mission\\-aligned, with a culture rooted in curiosity, speed, and long\\-term thinking. As the company grows its constellation and expands Aurora, the focus remains on making space\\-based insights practical, scalable, and genuinely helpful so that the health of the planet becomes measurable and action becomes possible.
   

  

 Pixxel was the only Indian startup selected for the Techstars Starburst Space Accelerator in Los Angeles and has been recognised in TIME’s Best Inventions of 2023, Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, and Via Satellite’s Top Innovators list.
   

  

 For more information, see our Careers page or follow Pixxel on LinkedIn and X/Twitter.
   

  

 Culture
   

  

 Pixxel is an organisation where we enable our employees to work on world\\-changing problems that they are passionate about, and a place where they can be their best selves day in and day out while ensuring they have fun every day.
   

  

 Central to our employee\\-first ethos is a commitment to ensuring that every team member feels valued and heard. We nurture a healthy and supportive work environment where we prioritise well\\-being and growth in all aspects of life

 A rare opportunity for a passionate Flutter developer to drive large\\-scale impact in India.
 



 Leap 300 is building the first\\-ever high\\-tech, low\\-touch model to help the poorest families (\\<$2/day income) defeat poverty within 300 days. In just 18 months, we’ve gained strong interest from multiple state governments and leading foundations, and our platforms are on track to impact 5 million lives within the next 3 years. As a well\\-funded non\\-profit, we offer a highly purpose\\-driven environment with a dynamic team.
 



  





 We are developing an integrated, custom\\-designed tech stack for the marginalized poor and the organizations serving them—making livelihood and skilling programs 2–4x more effective. This includes:
 



 ● A first\\-of\\-its\\-kind poverty alleviation stack with a 300\\-day selection\\-to\\-graduation goal.
 



 ● A voice\\-assisted, local\\-language LMS designed for the ultra\\-poor with very low literacy.
 



 ● A donor engagement platform with internship products that allow teenagers to experience and contribute to this transformation.
 



  





 Together, these platforms will form the world’s first non\\-profit SaaS stack, built on the best principles of UX, gamification, and community—enabling governments and impact organizations to deliver scalable poverty alleviation programs worldwide.
 



  





**The Role:** 




 Ideal candidate has 2\\-4 years of experience in app development and is
 



 ● deeply empathetic towards the user

**Job Responsibilities:** 




 ● Implement user\\-friendly applications based on design mockups and wireframes, optimising for maximum speed and scalability.
 



 ● Improve performance by optimising the application. Our platforms will reach highly under\\-served audiences in challenging circumstances, hence will require out\\-of\\-box thinking when conventional, off\\-the\\-shelf technological stacks fail.
 



 ● Conduct thorough testing and debugging of applications to ensure quality and functionality.
 



 ● Constantly be interested in learning app implications as we develop machine learning models to utilise our large\\-scale beneficiary interactions data to improve our intervention model over time and predict outcomes.
 



  





**Qualifications** 
 :
 



 ● Proven experience as a Flutter Developer with a strong portfolio showcasing your projects.
 



 ● Proficiency in frameworks such as Flutter and native Android and related technologies.
 



 ● Solid understanding of mobile app development, architecture, and design patterns.
