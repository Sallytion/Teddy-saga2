**This is a great fit if you love building from scratch and taking products from 0 → 1 → n.** 




  





**What You’ll Do** 



* Own products end\\-to\\-end: Design and build core systems across our AI stack (search, knowledge graph, internal tools, platforms).
* Ship 0 → 1 products: Work from vague problem statements to live products \\- defining scope, making tradeoffs, and iterating quickly based on real usage.
