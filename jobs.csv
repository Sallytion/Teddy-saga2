 Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.
   

  

 Since 2012, we have built the market\\-leading cloud security company and an award\\-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Paris, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo.

You will be part of designing and building systems that provide critical infrastructure for global Fortune 100 companies.
   

  

**What you will be doing:**
* Architecting and Building Distributed Data Systems
* Design and implement large\\-scale distributed platforms, microservices, and frameworks.
* Build data ingestion pipelines that can handle millions of telemetry events daily, both streaming and batch.
* Ensure systems are fault\\-tolerant, highly available, and cost\\-efficient at scale.
* Translating Complex Business Needs into Software
* Partner closely with the product team to understand complex operational and analytical requirements.
* Convert these into usable, performant, and maintainable technical solutions.
* Technical Leadership
* Serve as a technical mentor and architectural guide for senior developers.
* Lead architecture reviews, design discussions, and code reviews.
* Influence engineering practices and promote best\\-in\\-class observability, reliability, and security.

 Cloud, Containerization, and SRE
   

  

* Proven experience designing/deploying on AWS or other cloud providers.
* Expertise in Docker and Kubernetes orchestration.
* Deep understanding of SRE principles — monitoring, alerting, SLIs/SLOs, and incident management.
