**Role Summary: Build Agentic AI for the Financials SaaS**
 At Oracle Financials SaaS Applications, we’re at a historic inflection point. For decades, enterprise finance systems have depended on static rules and manual processes. We are leading a major shift—embedding intelligent, agentic AI directly into the financial core of the world’s largest enterprises. This is about more than adding AI features: it’s about transforming software from a tool into a true teammate that can reason, plan, and act within high\\-stakes workflows—like dispute resolution, cash application, and collections—while meeting the highest standards of accuracy, security, and trust. This is a chance to work on real customer data at global scale while meeting the bar finance demands: accuracy, security, and explainability.
   

  

 We’re hiring early\\-career engineers (2–4 years) who want to grow quickly in applied AI \\+ enterprise systems. You don’t need to be an AI specialist yet—strong fundamentals, curiosity, and ownership matter most.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Build and improve agent workflows: prompts, tools, orchestration, and multi\\-step reasoning patterns
* Prototype, test, and ship production agentic experiences that improve receivables outcomes
* Develop fluency in Fusion Receivables (flows, business logic, integrations) to ground solutions in real operations
* Partner with engineering, architecture, product, and UX to deliver end\\-to\\-end features
* Design for reliability and transparency: evaluation, guardrails, human\\-in\\-the\\-loop, and clear explanations


**What We’re Looking For**
* 2\\+ years professional software engineering experience (Java/Python/SQL or similar), building scalable systems
* Some exposure to AI/ML, LLMs, or agentic frameworks (work, coursework, hackathons, or personal projects)
* Ability to break complex problems into clean solutions; strong debugging/analysis habits
* Interest in learning the business context behind decisions and workflows
* A builder mindset: curiosity, experimentation, and a bias to ship responsibly


**What You’ll Learn (career Acceleration)**
* How ERP \\+ financial workflows operate at enterprise scale
* How to build safe, controlled agentic systems (evaluation, guardrails, HITL oversight)
* How prompts, data, and tool\\-use come together in production
* How to deliver innovation through cross\\-functional execution and customer adoption


**About Fusion Receivables And Our Operating Principles**
 Oracle Fusion Receivables is a cornerstone of the Order\\-to\\-Cash lifecycle—billing, payments, cash application, and accounts receivable for businesses worldwide. As we evolve it with agentic AI, we hold a non\\-negotiable standard: trust in finance requires explainability, security, and predictable behavior.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Design, build, and enhance agent workflows, including prompts, tools, orchestration, and multi\\-step reasoning patterns.
* Prototype, test, and deliver production\\-ready agentic AI experiences to improve receivables outcomes.
* Develop deep understanding of Fusion Receivables’ flows, business logic, and integrations to ensure effective, grounded solutions.
* Collaborate with engineering, architecture, product, and UX teams to deliver end\\-to\\-end features.
* Ensure solutions are reliable, transparent, and secure by implementing robust evaluation, guardrails, and human\\-in\\-the\\-loop (HITL) processes.
* Break down complex business and technical challenges into scalable, safe, and maintainable solutions.
* Continuously learn and adapt to advancements in AI, LLMs, and financial systems to drive innovation and user\\-centric outcomes.
