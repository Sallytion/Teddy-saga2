 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

* REST APIs
* Session management and auth flows
* Database schema design and implementation
* Service wiring and state handling
* Work with data to demonstrate functional workflows without requiring live integrations
* Own feature development end\\-to\\-end, from architecture → implementation → testing → polish
* Conduct code reviews and uphold a strong engineering quality bar within the team

 You may be tasked with replicating core workflows from the Ramp platform: Expenses \\& Reimbursements lifecycle
   

  

* Virtual card creation \\+ request flows
* Employee / org management dashboards
* Billing \\& accounting pages with filtering/sorting/state flows
* Navigation \\+ interaction patterns matching real UX


 Reference design surface: https://try.ramp.com/home
   

  

 The goal is a real and functional product experience used to train advanced AI models, for example OpenAI ChatGPT and Anthropic Claude, to navigate these environments to complete valuable tasks.
   

  

**What We’re Looking For**
 Professional software engineering experience in production systems
   

  

 Strong proficiency in:
   

  

* TypeScript
* React or similar frontend framework
