 Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.
   

  

 Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third\\-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.
   

  

 Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1\\.8B\\+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.
   

  

 We prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.
   

  

**About The Integrations Platform Team**
 Rippling is the world’s first unified workforce platform, but ""unified"" only works if Rippling can talk to outside systems and vice\\-versa. The
 ****Integration Platform****
 team is the nervous system of this ecosystem. We are moving away from manual, bespoke coding toward a ""Golden State"" where
 ****integrations build themselves****
 .
   

  

 Our mission is to provide a world\\-class
 ****end\\-to\\-end SDLC****
 for every developer—whether they are internal product teams, strategic partners, or external developers. We don't just build features; we build the foundational platforms that allow thousands of people to build on Rippling at high velocity and with perfect consistency.
   

  

****The Ecosystem You Will Build****
 When you join this team, you will work across three high\\-impact platform pillars that define how the world interacts with Rippling:
   

  

* Integration Building Platform: You’ll build the SDKs and frameworks (like Flux) that allow teams to skip the ""plumbing"" and focus on unique logic. You ensure that every integration—regardless of who builds it—feels consistent, reliable, and ""native"" to the Rippling customer.
* External API Platform: We don't write individual APIs; we build the standardized paths, documentation infrastructure, and high\\-performance middleware that enable every product team at Rippling to launch discoverable, secure, and fast APIs in record time.


****Marketplace \\& Marketplace Ecosystem:****
 You’ll architect the engine behind our App Shop. This includes everything from how customers
 ****discover and purchase****
 new apps to the logic that makes
 ****installing a complex integration****
 as simple as a single click.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As a Software Engineer (L5\\), you are a core driver of our platform’s execution. You will contribute to a technical ecosystem that powers the entire software development lifecycle, ensuring that every integration and API built on Rippling is consistent, reliable, and high\\-performing.
   

  

**What You Will Do**
* Power the SDLC: Build and maintain the core features of our integration and API frameworks, helping teams deploy new capabilities with high velocity and standardized patterns.
* Marketplace Innovation: Contribute to the logic that powers the App Shop, improving how customers discover, purchase, and install the tools they need to run their businesses.
* AI\\-Driven Tooling: Work on integrating AI into our developer workflows to simplify third\\-party connectivity and make the integration process more intelligent.
* Automation\\-First Mindset: Support our ""Zero KTLO"" mission by identifying and automating manual processes, ensuring our platform is resilient and easier for everyone to maintain.
* Execution Excellence: Take ownership of platform features—from building the standardized paths for API V2 endpoints to enhancing the consistency of how customers interact with third\\-party apps.


**What You Will Need**
* 1\\-2 years of professional experience in backend engineering.
* Strong Foundations: A solid grasp of CS fundamentals and proficiency in at least one backend language (Python or Go preferred).
* Execution Excellence: You take pride in shipping clean, well\\-tested code and documentation that other developers can rely on.
* Curiosity \\& Drive: You are eager to work on high\\-leverage platform problems and have a passion for creating great experiences for both developers and end\\-users.
