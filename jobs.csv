 at Suki (View all jobs)
   

  

 Bangalore, India
   

  

**What we want to accomplish and why we need you**
 Suki is creating a new category in the health tech space – the digital assistant. We are going to be the voice user interface for healthcare. What does that mean? Currently, doctors use their electronic medical record system to track patient encounters (a digital version of the old paper charts you used to see in your doctor's office and on TV). These systems can be hard to navigate and very time consuming to manage – time that doctors would rather have to spend with their patients. This is the problem we're solving right now! Doctors that use Suki already spend over 50% less time on administrative tasks and we're striving to do even better.
   

  

 We are creating engaging product experiences, building applications and services that delight and empower doctors with experiences that they could never imagine with their health IT systems. We're a team of technologists, clinicians, and industry experts working together to push the limits on technology used in medicine and even how medicine is practiced. We’re a GCP shop and 100% container run using Kubernetes. Our tech stack includes Golang, Python, React, React Native, Swift, Android, Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript.
   

  

**What will you do everyday?**
 We are looking for a
 **Software Developer** 
 to join our Backend Engineering team. Specifically, you will be:
   

  

* Collaborating with the product, design and operations teams to build a world class product
* Developing, owning and maintaining highly scalable distributed services and solutions
* Implementing a microservices based architecture using Golang and Python
* Ensure application performance, uptime, and maintaining high standards of code quality
* Maintaining continuous integration and deployment tools; creating unit and integration tests for written software code


**Ok, you're sold, but what are we looking for in the perfect candidate?**
* Expertise: You know how to code. You understand our tech stack and can be productive with it. In other words, you’ve done this before.
* Action oriented: You love to build. You like to ship fast and quickly iterate.
