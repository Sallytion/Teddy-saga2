 **Data Mesh** 
 and Lakehouse architectural patterns to drive domain\\-oriented ownership and high data quality.
* Develop and maintain user\\-defined metadata layers and semantic catalogs for governed querying and consistent reporting.
* Optimize schema design, indexing, and data storage for both analytical and transactional performance across streaming and batch environments.



  





**Agentic AI, Knowledge Graphs \\& Automation** 




  




* Rapidly upskill on RAG\\-based knowledge graph creation and fine\\-tuning, applying the latest AI models to accelerate semantic discovery.
* Rely on
 **AI\\-assisted development tools** 
 (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider) for code generation, documentation, and optimization—minimizing hand\\-coding while maximizing productivity.
* Automate ETL/ELT workflows, implement robust data validation, and establish CI/CD practices for data pipelines, including regression and anomaly testing.
* Integrate and optimize
 **stream, batch, and micro\\-batch workflows** 
 to ensure seamless, end\\-to\\-end data processing and analytics delivery.



  





**Data Product \\& BI Delivery** 




  




* Design, version, and deliver
 **data products** 
 with clear contracts and lineage, supporting reusable and testable analytics building blocks.
* Develop advanced
 **BI reports and dashboards** 
 (using tools like Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Superset) that surface key data\\-driven insights and metrics.
* Ensure data integrity, quality, and consistency throughout the lifecycle via automated tests, validation frameworks, and detailed documentation.
* Monitor, profile, and proactively improve pipeline reliability, performance, and scalability—across real\\-time, batch, and micro\\-batch environments.



  





**Leadership, Collaboration \\& Mentoring** 




  




* Partner with data scientists, business analysts, and product teams to co\\-create high\\-impact, user\\-centric solutions.
* Mentor junior engineers on advanced SQL, semantic modeling, AI\\-augmented workflows, and modern data processing paradigms (streaming, batch, micro\\-batch).
* Communicate complex technical concepts clearly across technical and non\\-technical audiences.



  





**What Sets You Apart** 




  





**Qualifications** 




  




* Bachelor’s in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field from a top\\-tier engineering college
* 2\\+ years in data engineering or data product roles, with deep experience in SQL, semantic modeling, and pipeline design.
* Hands\\-on expertise in RDBMS, cloud data platforms (
 **AWS, Azure, GCP** 
 ), and cloud data warehouses (
 **BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks** 
 ).
* **Proven experience in SQL\\-based stream processing (Apache Flink), batch/micro\\-batch processing (Apache Spark), and cloud\\-native SQL data engineering.**
* Proficiency in Python (preferred) or Java/Scala for data transformation and automation.
* Familiarity with big data (Spark, Kafka, Hadoop) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis) is a plus.
* Proven experience using AI code assistant tools for productivity and workflow acceleration.
* Strong foundation in data architecture, version control, data governance, and metadata management.



  





**Core Competencies** 




  




* Integrity, sound judgment, and a relentless commitment to data quality and innovation.
* Strategic, adaptive thinker with the ability to translate complex business needs into actionable data solutions.
* Excellent communicator, influencer, and collaborator across diverse technical and business teams.
