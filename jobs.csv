 A
 **Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)** 
 for pioneering intelligent business outcomes, leading complex AI\\-native software engineering initiatives .
 



  





**What are we looking for** 




 real solver?
 



**We identify better ways of doing things.** 




**Solver? Absolutely. But not the usual kind.** 
 We're searching for the architects of the audacious \\& the pioneers of the possible. If you're the type to dismantle assumptions, re\\-engineer ‘best practices,’ and build solutions that make the future possible NOW, then you're speaking our language.
 


* Improver. Solver. Futurist.
* Great sense of humor.
* ‘Possible. It is.’ Mindset.
* Compassionate collaborator. Bold experimenter. Tireless iterator.
* Natural creativity that doesn’t just challenge the norm, but solves to design what’s better.
* Thinks in systems. Solves at scale.



**This Isn’t for Everyone.** 
 But if you’re the kind who questions
 *why* 
 things are done a certain way—and then identifies 3 better ways to do it — we’d love to chat with you.
 



  





**Your Mission: The Role** 




*solving for better.* 




  





**The process\\-first, outcome\\-driven leader** 
 who owns the execution, quality, and technical growth of a high\\-performing engineering squad, translating modern architectures into measurable client impact
 **.** 




**You're not just managing resources. You're driving the engine of growth.** 




  





**Your Responsibilities** 




*what you will wake up to solve.* 




  





 This isn’t a ‘resource allocation’ role. You are a
 **forward\\-deployed solver (FDS)** 
 , a
 **DRI** 
 who owns the velocity and quality of solution delivery. Your mission is to foster a team of expert engineers, lead execution rigor, and ensure that every project we ship is a benchmark for
 **AI\\-driven modernization** 
 and
 **real business outcome** 
 .
 



 Here’s how you’ll make your mark:
 



  





**Own Delivery Execution \\& Engineering Excellence.** 



* **Lead the Squad:** 
 Serve as the hands\\-on leader for a team of Modern Product Engineers, owning project execution, code quality, and delivery timelines across multiple simultaneous client engagements.
* **Translate Architecture to Code:**

* **Process Enforcement:** 
 Implement and enforce Searce’s 'process\\-first' standards, ensuring rigorous application of agile methodologies, code reviews, and quality benchmarks across the BU's portfolio.
* **Quality Assurance:** 
 Own the quality engineering lifecycle, ensuring strong test coverage, minimised technical debt, and robust CI/CD pipeline integrity for every deployment.



  





**Drive Team Growth \\& Operational Health.** 



* **Elevate Talent:** 
 Actively coach, mentor, and elevate the technical skills of your squad, guiding engineers through their growth paths and driving high internal promotion rates.
* **Culture Carrier:** 
 Champion Searce's
 **""Always in Beta""** 
 mindset and
 **""Happier""** 
 values within the team, fostering a high\\-ownership, accountable, and collaborative culture.
* **Operational Insight:** 
 Manage the squad’s utilization and efficiency targets, balancing billable work with critical internal IP creation and capability building.



  





**Bridge Clients \\& Outcome.** 



* **Client Interface:** 
 Serve as the technical point\\-of\\-contact for operational project discussions, managing client expectations regarding timelines, scope, and technical trade\\-offs.
* **IP Development:** 
 Guide the team in creating and maintaining reusable assets, shared code libraries, and specialized automation scripts that enhance the BU's offering and market differentiation
* Lead engaging discovery workshops using first\\-principles thinking to uncover core client problems amenable to AI\\-powered software solutions.
* Apply our proprietary evlos methodology—iterate fast and fearlessly in the design and development of innovative systems.
* Your role is to serve as the
 **chief technical translator** 
 between a client's biggest challenges and our most intelligent, AI\\-powered software engineering solutions.
* Design AI\\-native, cloud\\-forward solutions grounded in process intelligence that drive true value.
* Replace “nice slides” with “pleasant surprises for clients” via working real outcomes.



  





**Lead by example \\& impact, Not control.** 



* At Searce, leadership is an action, not a title. You are the DRI for intelligent, impactful, client outcomes driven by robust software architecture.
* Mentor and technically guide fellow engineers, actively contributing to the growth of top\\-tier solver talent.
* Live the “Always in Beta” mindset \\- build learners, not followers in our engineering practices.
* Model extreme ownership, radical clarity, and calm in chaos when facing complex technical challenges.
* Believe in truth over comfort and learning over knowing, especially in the rapidly evolving AI/Cloud landscape.
* Contribute to cultivating a culture of self\\-managed, happier do\\-ers through technical excellence and collaborative problem\\-solving.



  





**Welcome to Searce** 




 The ‘process\\-first’, AI\\-native modern tech consultancy that's rewriting the rules.
 



**We don’t do traditional.** 




 As an engineering\\-led consultancy, we are dedicated to relentlessly improving the real business outcomes. Our solvers co\\-innovate with clients to
 **futurify** 
 operations and make processes smarter, faster \\& better. We build alongside our clients. Not for the vanity metrics. But for the transformation to embed lasting competitive advantage for our clients.
