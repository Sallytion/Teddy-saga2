 We are looking for a highly motivated Solutions Software Developer to join our small, dynamic, and impactful Solutions Team. This is not a typical 9\\-to\\-5 development role; it’s a mission for a developer who thrives on ownership, initiative, and delivering high\\-quality, custom\\-tailored solutions that directly address specific client business needs.
   

  

 The Solutions Team is responsible for the entire software lifecycle of solutions that are either native extensions of or complementary to the ClientPoint platform. You won't be working on general product features, but on high\\-impact, bespoke projects that require strong skills in discovery and requirement setting to solve complex, client\\-specific business problems—often involving connections to major CRM platforms. If you take deep pride in your work, want your contributions to have a direct, visible impact on client success, and are looking for a role with significant longevity and challenge, this is the place for you. You will be expected to ""get the job done and done well,"" consistently striving for excellence in every solution you deliver.
   

  

**What You'll Be Doing**
 As a Solutions Software Developer, you will be the driving force behind custom projects that solve unique customer challenges. Your responsibilities will include.
   

* **End\\-to\\-End Custom Solution Delivery:** 
 Taking full ownership of assigned projects, you will manage all phases from concept to deployment: discovery of client needs, detailed requirements analysis, architectural design, coding, testing (QA), and implementation.
* **ERP and System Integration:** 
 Developing and maintaining robust, real\\-time integrations between ClientPoint and key client systems, with a focus on leveraging the NetSuite REST API for complex data exchange (e.g., order, billing, and customer records).
* **Workflow Automation:** 
 Designing and implementing automation solutions for clients, often involving the use and configuration of platforms like Zapier or similar integration services to connect our solutions to over 5,000 third\\-party apps.
* **Complex Document Generation:** 
 Leveraging expert\\-level knowledge of PHPDocX to create intricate and highly customized document generation solutions for clients.
* **Full\\-Stack Development:** 
 Developing and maintaining applications primarily using PHP (with Zend Framework 1\\), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* **Data Management \\& APIs:** 
 Writing complex, optimized SQL queries, managing database structures, and utilizing cURL for advanced API creation and consumption (XML/JSON).
* **Code \\& Collaboration:** 
 Utilizing Git for version control and collaborating within the Azure DevOps environment for project management, CI/CD, and quality assurance.
* **Communication \\& Requirements:** 
 Serving as a strong, clear communicator, you will work closely with stakeholders to translate vague client business needs into clear, actionable technical requirements and deliverables.


**What You'll Bring**
 We need a technically proficient developer who is also a strong problem\\-solver and is ready to take ownership of client\\-facing projects and integrations.
   

**Technical Expertise:**
* Expert\\-level proficiency in PHP and solid experience with the Zend Framework 1 (ZF1\\) codebase.
* Expert\\-level knowledge of PHPDocX is required for advanced document generation solutions.
* Demonstrable experience with major ERP integration, specifically consuming the NetSuite REST API.
* Familiarity with workflow automation platforms like Zapier (or similar no\\-code/low\\-code integration tools).
* Strong command of SQL for complex queries, procedures, and performance tuning.
* Proficiency in front\\-end technologies: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Proven ability to create and consume APIs (REST/SOAP) and work with data formats like XML and JSON.
* Experience with Git, Azure DevOps, and advanced use of cURL.


**Personal Attributes:**
* Strong Sense of Ownership \\& Initiative: You are a self\\-starter who owns the client's problem, drives the bespoke solution to completion without constant supervision, and consistently strives to get the job done and done well.
* Business Acumen: Ability to rapidly understand a customer's business process, especially in relation to ERP and data flow, and translate that into technical requirements and architectural designs.
* Great Communicator: Able to clearly articulate technical concepts and integration requirements to both technical colleagues and non\\-technical clients.
* Comfortable Working Model: Feels confident working independently on complex integration projects while being a productive and collaborative part of the Solutions Team.
* A Commitment to Longevity: You are looking for a stable and challenging career home where you can grow your skills for years to come.


**Why Join the Solutions Team?**
 You'll be part of a team where your contributions matter immediately. Every project is unique, offering continuous learning and problem\\-solving opportunities, especially in the realm of complex system integrations. We offer a challenging environment where you are empowered to make decisions and where excellence in bespoke solution delivery is the standard.
