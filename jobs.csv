 This isn’t just “testing.” It’s ensuring WrkTalk meets the gold standard in reliability, performance, and security before it ever reaches a client.
 



  





**Who are we?** 




  





 We are a young product company scaling fast and outgrowing the startup tag—with global scale in our crosshairs. We don’t do “okay.” We give everything we’ve got to build the best communication platform in the world. Our team includes engineers from IIT and other top institutions—people who care deeply about the craft, performance, and purpose. You’ll learn more in 6 months here than most engineers do in 3 years elsewhere. We’re intense. High\\-strung. Focused. Our team includes engineers from IIT and other top\\-tier
 



 backgrounds. But what defines us is not our degrees—it’s our refusal to compromise on quality, performance, or privacy.
 



  





**What are we building?** 




  





 WrkTalk is the world's first zero\\-access, zero\\-spam enterprise communication product that operates on a structural privacy architecture. One that’s already earned the trust of large enterprises like L\\&T Finance, Adani Group, and Kalyan Jewellers – just to name a few of our enterprise clients. This is not an MVP. This is production\\-grade software that secures communication for thousands—and soon, millions—of professionals worldwide.
 



  





**What’s the role?** 




  




* Create, own, and execute comprehensive test cases across functional, non\\-functional, integration, sanity, and regression testing.
* Lead testing strategy for product releases.
* Collaborate with engineers to ensure issues are identified, documented, and resolved quickly.
* Contribute to automation scripts for recurring tests.
* Ensure product security and compliance checks are validated before release.



  





**The tech here is serious.** 




 We work on socket\\-driven comms infrastructure, distributed control towers, multi\\-category encryption, root detection, app kill\\-switches, dynamic guest access, device\\-level lockout, and OOO/ DND logic layered with smart whitelisting. This is not lightweight app dev. This is protocol\\-layer decision\\-making.
 



  





**Who should apply?** 




  




* 3–6 years of software testing experience, preferably in secure enterprise products.
* Strong in test case design, execution, and defect tracking.
* Strong hands\\-on experience in automation testing using Playwright with JavaScript.
* Excellent analytical and documentation skills.
* Experience with cross\\-browser testing, mobile testing and API testing is a must.
* Familiarity with tools such as Browser Stack, Postman, etc is good to have.
* Experience in JavaScript ,TypeScript, or Java for Automation testing.
* Experience with Load testing/ Stress testing with tools like JMeter, Artillary is a plus



  





**Why should you join?** 




  




* Because you want to set the standards of testing that will ensure global quality
* Because you’ll work directly with established founders, not buried under layers
* Because you’ll ship real, deeply engineered features used by large number of enterprise users
* Because you’ll grow 10x faster here—in experience, learning, and impact
* And because if you walk this road with us for 3–4 years, it’ll catapult you into a tech orbit or fame and glory you never imagined
