* Serialisation Strategy: Implement Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for high\\-efficiency, non\\-ROS internal data logging and inter\\-process communication where overhead must be zero.


**Requirements**
**The Stack (ROS 1 and ROS 2\\):**
* Deep ROS 2 Mastery: You know the difference between spin(), spin\\_some(), and Multi\\-Threaded Executors. You understand why we are moving to ROS 2 (Real\\-time constraints, DDS security, QoS).
* Navigation Stack: In\\-depth knowledge of Nav2 (Planners, Controllers, Recoveries). You understand Global vs. Local planners (A\\*, DWB, TEB).
* SLAM and Localisation: Experience with Graph\\-based SLAM (Cartographer, SLAM Toolbox). You know how to close loops and optimise pose graphs.

**The Math (The ""Weeder""):**
* Linear Algebra and Geometry: Rigid body transformations are your second language. You understand Quaternions, homogeneous transformation matrices ($T \\\\in SE(3\\)$), and how to avoid Gimbal Lock.
* Kinematics: You can derive forward and Inverse Kinematics for the Differential Drive and Ackermann steering chassis.
* Probabilistic Robotics: Understanding of Bayesian estimation. You know that sensors are noisy and that ""Ground Truth"" is a myth.


**The Code**
