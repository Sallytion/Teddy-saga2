We’re revolutionizing the way people monitor their glucose levels with our new sensing technology.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Complete software testing and activities in conjunction for user stories within the Agile SDLC process (products supported may be more technical in nature, i.e. UI , SDK or API based products)
* Create verification and validation test plans, test reports, trace matrices to incorporate the automated tests and review with relevant stakeholders (dev and quality)
* Create an automation framework for mobile apps (iOS and Android)
* Develop and improve robust test automation framework. Ensure the framework works in conjunction with the Quality Management system as well as provides strong and quick feedback for Agile development. Ensure the framework covers functional, end to end, compatibility and use case scenarios. This will also require working with DevOps and other teams to integrate test automation with build systems, test management system, and device cloud.
* Convert manual test cases into automation scripts and whee applicable write automation scripts directly from system requirement specification and story acceptance criteria.
* Provide feedback and suggest improvements to the Agile SDLC process.
