 Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out.

 We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).
   

  

 We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.
   

  

 So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us! \\#WeAreCisco
   

  

 Why Cisco?
   

  

 At Cisco, we’re revolutionizing how data and infrastructure connect and protect organizations in the AI era – and beyond.

These solutions provide customers with unparalleled security, visibility, and insights across the entire digital footprint.

 If you want exposure to ETL pipelines, Python engineering, Generative AI use cases, and Azure cloud deployment — and you’re ready to write production\\-grade code — this role is for you.
   

  

 This is a 12\\-month full\\-time internship. You won’t be shadowing. You’ll be contributing.
   

  

**What You’ll Actually Do**
* Build and maintain ETL pipelines for structured and unstructured data.
* Write clean, modular Python code that moves from notebook to production.
* Integrate Generative AI models into real applications (LLMs, APIs, prompt engineering).
* Deploy and manage solutions on Microsoft Azure.
* Work with databases and ensure data quality and reliability.
* Debug, optimize, and improve systems that people actually use.


**What You Must Know (Foundations Matter)**
**Python**
* Strong fundamentals (functions, OOP, data structures).
* Comfortable with Pandas and working with real datasets.
* Ability to consume APIs and handle JSON.


**Data \\& ETL**
* Clear understanding of what ETL means and why it matters.
* SQL basics (joins, aggregations, filtering).
* Handling CSV, Excel, and database data without fear.


**Generative AI**
* Basic understanding of how LLMs work.
* Familiarity with prompt engineering concepts.
* Exposure to OpenAI or similar APIs is a plus.


**Azure Cloud (Foundational Knowledge)**
* Basic understanding of Azure services such as:

+ App Services
+ Azure Functions
+ Azure Data Factory (good to have)

* Awareness of deployment concepts (CI/CD, containers is a bonus).


**Tools**
* Git and GitHub.
* Comfortable working in VS Code or similar.


**What We Care About More Than Tools**
* Strong logical thinking.
* Curiosity and fast learning.
* Ability to debug independently.
* Ownership mindset — not “that’s not my task.”


 You don’t need to be an expert.
   

  

 You do need to understand fundamentals and be willing to level up fast.
   

  

**What You’ll Gain**
* Real production exposure to Data Engineering and AI systems.

 Prime Video is disrupting traditional media with an ever\\-increasing selection of movies, TV shows, Emmy Award winning original content, add\\-on subscriptions including HBO, and live events like Thursday Night Football. Our architecture operates at Amazon\\-scale and raises the bar for playback reliability, video start time, and image quality. Prime Video runs on thousands of device types in over 200 territories worldwide.
   

  

 The mission of the Content Localization \\& Accessibility team in Prime Video is to “Delight Prime Video customers world\\-wide with relevant language options and accessibility assists from Day 1”.
   

  

 With Prime Video’s 3Y goal to acquire and retain the next 100MM customers from international territories, it is imperative that our selection is made available to international customers in their preferred language. Generating such assets using Localization Service Providers (LSPs) takes multiple weeks to turn around and becomes cost prohibitive when scaled to our entire Catalog across the breadth of languages we support (32 UI languages). We obsess over making Prime Video the most inclusive streaming platform, providing content with accessibility assists like closed captions, audio description, and an industry\\-first Dialogue boost assist. With increased focus from regulatory bodies from several territories and mandating minimum bar for accessibility in terms of closed captions \\& audio descriptions coverage, the team is propelled to innovate for the customers in need. The Content Localization \\& Accessibility team drives this innovation by leveraging state of the art GenAI solutions to generate these multi\\-lingual and accessibility assets at scale, as well as building supply\\-chain automation, workflow management tooling and optimized human\\-in\\-the\\-loop solutions.
   

  

**Basic Qualifications**
* 5\\+ years of non\\-internship professional software development experience
* 5\\+ years of programming with at least one software programming language experience
* 5\\+ years of leading design or architecture (design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and existing systems experience
* Experience as a mentor, tech lead or leading an engineering team


**Preferred Qualifications**
* 5\\+ years of full software development life cycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, testing, and operations experience
* Bachelor's degree in computer science or equivalent
