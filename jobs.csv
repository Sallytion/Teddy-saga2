As FDE , you will bring your technical know\\-how to the main connections of the Bluecore engine to our clients \\- drawing meaningful intelligence from their websites and implementing marketing solutions that map to the customer’s vertical, audience behavior and product mix.
   

  

 As a Forward Deployed Engineer, your principal responsibilities will lie in (1\\) writing JavaScript integrations that live on client websites, (2\\) configuring and maintaining the intake and manipulation of client data across multiple channels including websites, SFTP clients, and Google Cloud Functions, (3\\) utilizing internal infrastructure and tooling to solve complex, often\\-unique, client\\-specific problems, and (4\\) interfacing with clients to help them understand and best utilize our array of products and services. Besides raw intellect and the ability to not take yourself too seriously, it is important to be detail\\-oriented in your work, as we work closely with a multitude of the industry’s top online retailers, all of which have very stringent requirements around the look and feel of their strategic communications.

You enjoy the puzzle and the process of iterating and ideating before implementing a solution, and you are able to break complex problems into simple components for better analysis and digestion.
* Metrics and Data: You are someone who finds yourself consumed by daily, weekly and monthly metrics and loves turning those into best practices. Seriously, you will advise executive\\-level decision\\-makers at industry\\-leading brands on best business practices.
* Teaching Others: You are someone who actually believes that diversity in thought and skills makes for a better workplace and a better you.


**Responsibilities**
* Write client\\-side JavaScript to be run on clients' websites and configure custom recommendation logic using domain\\-specific tooling.
* Serve as the technical point\\-of\\-contact for clients both pre\\- and post\\-launch: working with them to integrate their website and databases with Bluecore, as well as helping establish and maintain a strong, long\\-term technical relationship between their systems and Bluecore.
* Working closely with clients and with our Customer Success team to think creatively and strategically about ways to extract maximum value from the Bluecore platform, designing and implementing custom technical solutions as needed.
* Develop the best technical solution possible for the toughest challenges that our customers will throw at you.
* Ideate, develop, and improve upon internal tooling, procedures, and processes that facilitate the work of the Technical Services team.
* Monitor the overall health and uptime of our most critical connections to clients
* Work as a liaison between clients, Customer Success, and the product development team to improve Bluecore’s product offering.


**Requirements**
