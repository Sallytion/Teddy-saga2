 capability.
   

  

* Configure and manage external identity integration, including Azure AD/Entra ID, SSO, B2C, or


 identity providers.
   

  

 Integration \\& Automation
   

  

* Implement Power Automate workflows to support form submissions, approvals, and case


 intake processes.
   

  

* Work with architects to integrate with Azure services (Functions, Logic Apps, Service Bus, API


 Management).
   

  

* Configure and consume Dataverse Web API for dynamic data\\-driven UIs.


**Quality \\& Governance**
* Ensure solutions meet security, accessibility, performance, and privacy requirements.

 Collaboration \\& Stakeholder Engagement
   

  

* Work closely with functional consultants to convert prototypes into production\\-ready


 implementations.
   

  

* Collaborate with UX and service designers to refine interaction flows and UI behaviour.
* Support end\\-user feedback cycles, UAT triage, enhancements, and phased rollout planning.


**Skills, Knowledge \\& Expertise:**
**Required**
* 3\\+ years building solutions using Power Pages / Power Apps Portals or similar framework.
* Strong front\\-end development skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* Experience working with Liquid templates, Dataverse tables, forms, and lists.
* Understanding of authentication \\& access control concepts (Azure AD / B2C / OAuth).
* Familiarity with Power Platform ALM \\& Azure DevOps pipelines.


 Advantageous
   

  

* Experience delivering public\\-sector or regulated external service portals.
* PCF control development experience.

 ensuring secure access models.
