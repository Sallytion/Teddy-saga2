**About the Team: \\- Rippling PEO (Professional Employer Organization) and HR Services Overview** 




  





 Rippling’s
 **PEO (Professional Employer Organization)** 
 and
 **HR Services** 
 products help founders and small businesses build faster — and succeed with lower failure rates. Together, they drive over
 **$150M in annual revenue** 
 , forming a core pillar of Rippling’s business.
 



  





 In the early years, these systems were built at breakneck speed to enable go\\-to\\-market growth — fueling massive adoption but introducing tech debt and tightly coupled designs.
 



  





 Now in
 **Phase L2** 
 , the team is rebuilding the foundation into an
 **extensible, use\\-case–driven architecture** 
 — transforming complex, hard\\-coded systems into scalable, modular platforms. You’ll play a key role in re\\-imagining the backbone of Rippling’s HR ecosystem — improving developer velocity, reducing operational friction, and unlocking new market opportunities.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities**



* **System Reliability:** 
 Enterprise\\-grade stability across global employment, benefits, and compliance workflows, with zero critical failures in employee lifecycle operations.
* **Extensibility:** 
 New employment models, jurisdictions, and compliance frameworks added with minimal engineering effort and zero downtime.
* **Performance:** 
 Significant reduction in workflow latency, data synchronization time, and operational overhead across distributed systems.
* **Developer Velocity:** 
 Modular, well\\-abstracted APIs and frameworks that empower internal teams to build on top of PEO systems without friction.
* **Business Impact:** 
 Faster onboarding for new countries and partners, reduced manual interventions, and measurable improvements in customer satisfaction and retention.



**Required Qualifications**



* **7\\-10 years** 
 of experience building large\\-scale, distributed systems in
 **high\\-compliance or high\\-integrity domains** 
 (HR, Payroll, FinTech, or Insurance).
* Deep expertise in
 **domain\\-driven design** 
 ,
 **data modeling** 
 , and
 **compliance\\-first architecture** 
 .
* Experience
 **scaling complex regulatory or multi\\-tenant systems** 
 , ideally spanning employment, benefits, or HR platforms.
* Proficiency in designing
 **extensible, modular service boundaries** 
 that maintain
 **auditability and backward compatibility** 
 .
* Strong understanding of
 **policy enforcement, rule engines, and event\\-driven systems** 
 .
* Ability to translate
 **legal and operational complexity** 
 into
 **elegant, maintainable engineering abstractions** 
 .
* A
 **hands\\-on architectural leader** 
 who can set technical direction, mentor teams, and drive large\\-scale transformations sustainably.



**Bonus Points**



* Experience with
 **compliance\\-as\\-code** 
 or
 **policy automation** 
 frameworks.
* Exposure to
 **global employment** 
 ,
 **EOR** 
 , or
 **multi\\-country workforce** 
 systems.
* Familiarity with
 **event sourcing** 
 ,
 **CQRS** 
 , and
 **streaming architectures** 
 .
* Contributions to
 **open\\-source frameworks** 
 in HR, compliance, or distributed systems domains.



**Why Rippling**



* Backed by
 **world\\-class investors (Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, Bedrock, GIC, Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs)**
* Valued among the
 **fastest\\-growing SaaS companies** 
 in history
* Built at the core of Rippling’s HR foundation, where
 **global employment, compliance, and workforce management** 
 come together as one seamless system.
* Join a team that
 **pushes the limits of possible** 
 ,
 **builds winning systems, and moves fast with conviction.**","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/rippling","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGVw6UsjqtXGw/company-logo_100_100/B4EZlN73QeHIAQ-/0/1757949162831/rippling_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=_-PZ3E8XmdCyc89UhLvip3soyI97bY1FRM89cZYXEiQ","","","","","","","","","","",""

**About The Team**
 On the Voice Service and Experience Team we:
   

  

 ▪ Own features end\\-to\\-end, from the customer need all the way to the back\\-end implementation
   

  

 ▪ Ship code to production every day
   

  

 ▪ Are highly collaborative and foster a learning environment
   

  

 ▪ Do Agile development, with Sprints and regular retrospectives
   

  

 ▪ Function in a highly progressive, quick\\-iteration environment focused on delivering consistent, incremental customer value
   

  

 ▪ Have something new to demo every week
   

  

 The team’s mission is to continually reduce the time spent by customer\\-facing representatives on data access and modification across different systems. We provide customers with meaningful and relevant data aggregated at their fingertips, to increase the time they can invest in adding value for their customers.
   

  

 We’re currently shoring up the core functionalities of our telecom product. In the long term we want to give customers the same edge with calling and messaging that they have with email: the ability to optimize and constantly improve how they interact with customers. We will face new challenges as we continue to scale out to ten times the volume of calling we have today and beyond. These efforts present a diverse gamut of work that will help enhance Outreach’s competitive edge by making our customers more effective.
   

  

**The Role**
 Making and receiving voice calls are a key component of the Outreach product offering. Every month, Outreach customers complete more than 8 million calls with their prospects on our voice platform.

If you have experience building high availability voice communication experiences on top of open\\-source real\\-time communication software and commercial communications platform APIs, we’d love to talk to you about this opportunity.
   

  

 Telecom system development is a little different from other web development. The features we build are inherently heavy on state, complex in workflow, and include extensive third\\-party integrations. You’ll have to be creative, build on top of a lot of existing technology, and stay focused on Outreach’s core value proposition of revenue efficiency. You’ll be building systems to ensure calling is simple, reliable, and crystal clear; so that our customers can reduce the time on clicking around or performing repetitive actions and focus on what matters most \\- interacting with their prospects.
   

  

**Your Daily Adventures Will Include**
* Partnering with product managers, designers, and analysts to deeply understand the needs of our users and build a product that serves those needs
* Working with commercial CPaaS APIs and open\\-source real\\-time communication software to manage calls, messages, and security
* Finding ways to engineer high availability into a system that has lots of moving parts
* Working with stakeholders to make sure our customers have the tools they need to be successful on our platform
* Setting direction for the team and help guide engineering vision
