We solve hard and interesting problems at the intersection of computer science, finance, and mathematics. We are focused on innovating and rapidly applying innovations to real world scenarios. This enables engineers to work on interesting problems, learn quickly and have deep impact to the firm and the business.
   

  

 At Millennium, we are redefining how investment decisions are made. We don't just look at balance sheets; we harness the chaos of the real world. By analyzing vast amounts of unstructured data—from news briefings and earnings call audio to regulatory documents—we provide our Portfolio Managers (PMs) with the ""informational edge"" (Alpha) they need to outperform the market.
   

  

**The Role**

* Backend Microservices: Develop robust backend services to handle metadata management, search, and retrieval of processed alternative data.
* System Optimization: Tune the platform for speed. In financial markets, milliseconds matter; you will optimize database queries, serialization, and network calls to ensure data reaches the PMs instantly.
* Data Strategy: Implement storage strategies for unstructured data, utilizing Vector Databases for semantic search and Distributed File Systems for raw storage.


**Required Qualifications**
* Data Platform Experience: Minimum 5\\+ years of software engineering experience, preferably building data platforms.
* Core Languages: Strong proficiency in both Python and Java/C\\+\\+ is required. You should be comfortable switching between these languages for different use cases (e.g., Python for data processing, Java or C\\+\\+ for high\\-concurrency, scalable services).
* Data Engineering: Proven experience building data pipelines, ETL processes, or working with big data frameworks (e.g., Kafka, Airflow, Apache Parquet, Arrow, Iceberg , KDB etc).
* Unstructured Data Expertise: Proven experience working with unstructured data types (Text, Audio, Documents). Familiarity with techniques such as OCR, transcription normalization, text extraction.
