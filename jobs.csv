**Build the AI that builds teams** 




 Mercor trains large\\-scale models that predict on\\-the\\-job performance more accurately than any human interview.

 In your first year you’ll ship production code every week across Python\\- and Go\\-based services and a React/Next.js frontend that screens millions of candidates. You’ll design new microservices—real\\-time ranking, interview analytics, and payouts that move millions of dollars—while pairing with senior engineers to profile, test, and harden their LLM\\-powered agents.

**You’ll thrive if** 




 You have solid CS fundamentals and projects you’re proud to demo; you iterate fast—prototype, test, ship in days—and care as much about product polish as system performance.

You don't just write software—you build AI\\-driven systems that make traditional engineering look sluggish and inefficient. If that sounds like you, keep reading.
   

  

 Most software teams are still writing code the old way—manual debugging, trial\\-and\\-error deployments, and features that barely leverage AI beyond a sprinkle of Copilot suggestions. Trilogy is different. Every part of our development process is infused with AI: feature ideation, bug detection, defect resolution, and performance optimization. This isn't about dabbling in AI tools; this is about fully integrating AI into the software lifecycle to eliminate waste, ship faster, and build with precision.
   

  

 In this role, you will take existing B2B products, break them down, rebuild them as cloud\\-native applications, and optimize them with AI at every level. You'll be developing and deploying AI\\-powered features, using cutting\\-edge retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG) for automated defect detection, and ensuring every release is smooth—zero outages, zero disruptions, zero excuses. If you're looking for a job where you spend weeks debating architecture decisions instead of shipping, this isn't it.
   

  

 If you're ready to push the boundaries of AI\\-driven software engineering and accelerate your career into high\\-scale cloud\\-native development, apply now. If you prefer sticking to what you already know, writing test cases by hand, or working in teams that are afraid of automation, this isn't for you.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Using analysis tools and RAG vector stores to identify, diagnose, and correct product defects and fix bugs.
* Leveraging AI development agents to design, develop, and deploy innovative features for cloud\\-native applications.
* Collaborating with a global team to deliver high\\-quality, enterprise\\-grade solutions.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Routine Monotony: We keep cumbersome infrastructure tasks to a minimum so you can focus on creating innovative solutions.
* Endless Meetings: We value your expertise in development over sitting in meeting rooms. Expect more coding, less talking.


**Senior Software Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Implement AI\\-driven features to streamline workflows and empower service providers with innovative tools.


**Basic Requirements**
* 4\\+ years of professional experience in commercial software development, focusing on production code for server\\-side web applications
* Experience using GenAI code assistants (e.g., Github Copilot, Cursor, v0\\.dev); we are not looking for traditional ML engineers without LLM experience
* A willingness to use GenAI in your day\\-to\\-day development work


**About Trilogy**

For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer\\-facing designs.
