 As part of the AWS Applied AI Solutions organization, we have a vision to provide business applications, leveraging Amazon’s unique experience and expertise, that are used by millions of companies worldwide to manage day\\-to\\-day operations. We will accomplish this by accelerating our customers’ businesses through delivery of intuitive and differentiated technology solutions that solve enduring business challenges. We blend vision with curiosity and Amazon’s real\\-world experience to build opinionated, turnkey solutions. Where customers prefer to buy over build, we become their trusted partner with solutions that are no\\-brainers to buy and easy to use.
   

  

 The Team: From the merchandise stores at Sports venues to small\\-format stores such as Amazon Go, a new kind of technology is powering stores with no lines and no checkout. You simply use the Amazon app to enter the store, take what you want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals, grocery essentials and merchandise, and go.
   

  

 Our checkout\\-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out (JWO) Technology. It automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a cart. When you’re done shopping, you just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. Designed and custom\\-built by Amazonians, our technology uses computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning. Innovation is part of our DNA. We need people who want to join a high\\-reaching program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.
   

  

 The Role: Everyone on our team needs to be entrepreneurial, wear many hats and work in a highly collaborative environment that’s more startup than big company. We’re solving problems that span a broad range of domains: computer vision, image recognition, machine learning, and distributed systems.

You will help invent new features, design, develop and deploy reliable distributed services. You will work with a variety of core languages and technologies including Java, C\\+\\+, Linux.
   

  

 You will tackle challenging situations every day and you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems. Along the way, we guarantee that you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on many customers.
   

  

 The Role: You are a talented Software Engineer who knows how to design and code full\\-stack solutions. You know how to get things done, and done really well. You are a dreamer and a futurist. You have an inventor’s spirit, a can\\-do approach and proficiency in a wide range of design technologies, and a killer eye for detail. We are looking for talented engineers for Java and AWS services.
   

  

 In this role you’ll have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game\\-changing initiative. While you’ll be able to use existing Amazon systems when possible, you’ll be working on challenging problems that need creative solutions. You should be comfortable building prototypes, challenging assumptions, and thinking of creative ways to tackle challenges.
   

  

**Basic Qualifications·**
* 3\\+ years of non\\-internship professional software development experience
* Programming experience with at least one modern language such as Java, C\\+\\+, or C\\# including object\\-oriented design
* 1\\+ years contributing to the architecture and design (architecture, design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and current systems

 Our leading SaaS\\-based Global Employment Platform™ enables clients to expand into over 180 countries quickly and efficiently, without the complexities of establishing local entities. At G\\-P, we’re dedicated to breaking down barriers to global business and creating opportunities for everyone, everywhere.
   

  

 Our diverse, remote\\-first teams are essential to our success. We empower our Dream Team members with flexibility and resources, fostering an environment where innovation thrives and every contribution is valued and celebrated.
   

  

 The work you do here will positively impact lives around the world. We stand by our promise: Opportunity Made Possible. In addition to competitive compensation and benefits, we invite you to join us in expanding your skills and helping to reshape the future of work.
   

  

 At G\\-P, we assist organizations in building exceptional global teams in days, not months—streamlining the hiring, onboarding, and management process to unlock growth potential for all.
   

  

**About The Position**
 Join our GIA Experience Team as a Senior Full Stack Engineer where you'll work across the entire stack—crafting beautiful React interfaces and architecting robust backend services. You're someone who thrives when the path isn't perfectly clear, takes ownership of problems from inception to solution, and naturally mentors others while shipping great code.
   

  

**What You Will Do**
**Frontend Development** 
 : You'll lead the charge on building interfaces that users actually want to use. Working with React 18\\+ and TypeScript, you'll create component libraries that other developers will thank you for, ensure our app works flawlessly across browsers, and make accessibility a first\\-class citizen. You'll integrate with our APIs, implement those smooth animations that make users smile, and maybe even dabble in voice interactions.
   

  

**Backend Development** 
 : On the server side, you'll build scalable backend services in Python (running on AWS) and Go that can handle whatever our users throw at them. You'll design APIs that are both powerful and intuitive, manage infrastructure using AWS services like ECS/EKS and Lambda, and ensure everything is secure, observable, and thoroughly tested.
   

  

**Keeping Standards High** 
 : You'll establish CI/CD pipelines that just work, champion testing practices that catch bugs before they escape, and conduct code reviews that help everyone level up. Performance monitoring isn't an afterthought—it's baked into everything you build.
   

  

**Leading Through Collaboration** 
 : You'll work closely with product managers who dream big, UX designers who obsess over details, and AI/ML engineers who push boundaries. You'll mentor mid\\-level engineers not just in code, but in thinking like a product engineer. And when you spot opportunities to prototype AI\\-enhanced features that could be game\\-changers, you'll make it happen.
   

  

**What Makes This Role Unique**
* You’ll join a small, startup\\-structured team within the larger G\\-P organization.
* Passionate about building and defining early stage products.
* You’ll be helping to build GIA from the ground up — shaping both the product and the underlying tech
* We’re seeking individuals with a strong product mindset and expert\\-level engineering skills
* You must thrive in fast\\-paced, ambiguous environments where direction isn’t always handed to you
* You’ll need to be highly independent and self\\-directed
* Must know how to identify what to build next, without always being told
* Expect to wear multiple hats and contribute across the stack
* While collaboration is essential, you must also lead as an individual contributor


**Important Note**
 If you’re not prepared to operate at this level or aren’t excited by the challenge — this role may not be the right fit.
   

  

**Minimum Requirements**
**What We Are Looking For:**
* 6\\+ years of building web applications that people use, with solid experience on both frontend and backend
* You know React 18\\+ inside and out, and you're comfortable with the entire modern JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
* Strong Python skills with AWS experience
* You've designed APIs (REST and/or GraphQL) that other developers enjoy working with
* Hands\\-on experience with AWS services, Docker, and infrastructure as code
* You've built CI/CD pipelines and understand why observability matters


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Practical Go experience for backend development
* Experience with BFF patterns, GraphQL federation, or service mesh architectures
* React Native or cross\\-platform mobile development
* AI/ML integration experience (prompt management, LLM feedback loops)
* AWS certifications
* Kubernetes and event\\-driven architectures (Kafka, SQS)

 Sundial is a top VC\\-backed early\\-stage startup headquartered at San Francisco Bay Area, US with a second office in Bengaluru, India. We have
 
 raised
 
**$23M** 

 to build the analytics platform for the AI era.
 
 Our founders are industry veterans Chandra Narayanan, previously Chief Data Scientist at Sequoia Capital, and Julie Zhuo, previously VP, Design and Research at Facebook, author of a bestselling management book. We are a small team of top talent, high caliber Engineers, Data Scientists, Designers and PM (currently 49 in India, 5 in US) and rapidly growing.
 



  





 We are on a mission to help builders make meaningful use of data to fulfill their vision. Sundial automatically diagnoses a product's data to explain the ""what"" and the ""why"" to enable faster and better decision making.
 



  





 Now Pull up a chair! We're excited to tell you more about our vision for Sundial! By now, you've probably visited our website and maybe our LinkedIn page and browsed around the profiles of our team members. If you haven't yet, please take a moment to do so. We'll wait 🙂
 



  





 Okay, now you know at a high level that we are focused on data storytelling. The data space has over $100B in market opportunity ahead of it, and modern Business Intelligence tools are growing at over 15% year over year.We've seen this evolution firsthand. Our co\\-founders Chandra Narayanan and Julie Zhuo cut their teeth scaling Facebook from a few million college students to billions of people.
 



  





 To make the best decisions possible, companies are investing more and more into understanding their data. And yet, demand far outpaces supply for Data Scientists and Data Platform Engineers who can construct useful narratives out of the growing firehose of raw data, tables and charts. Currently most data\\-centric organizations have a large Data Platform and Data Science team that builds Big Data Platforms, Insights Data stores to bring data into dashboards and manually generates reports to communicate the product story broadly. But a large part of this process can be easily productised.
 



  





 At Sundial, we're building a Sundial’s Insights Data Platform. This platform converts raw data in large Data Warehouses into a universe of deep product insights that product teams—including PMs, data scientists, executives and engineers—consume easily. This involves Highly Scalable, Robust Distributed Data Platform which can consistently, repeatably run complex Data Science and Transformation algorithms at Cloud Scale.
 



  





 We envision a future where every organization becomes a data\\-informed organization through our work of:
 


* Productising the diagnostic analysis of yesterday so teams can focus on the strategic bets for tomorrow.
* Making data understanding easy and accessible to everyone, not just data scientists.
* Surfacing opportunities of improvement in growth across segments



*We believe better usage of data leads to better products, and better products lead to better experiences for people.*

**You will probably like working with us if:** 



* You like the ownership, camaraderie and chaos of a start\\-up environment \\- Start\\-ups are not right for everyone. Things move quickly and change frequently. Start\\-ups haven't ""made it"" yet. We have to convince customers we are valuable enough to them. We must be scrappy and flexible. Everyone will wear lots of hats. But: if you have future aspirations of being an entrepreneur or leader, you'll find few better learning grounds. You'll learn by doing. You'll be given a ton of trust and responsibility. You'll see very transparently how we operate and make decisions. Your work will absolutely matter to the success of our company.
* You value learning and have a growth mindset \\- Sundial is founded on the idea that slope is far more important than intercept. We are a learning environment, and all of us have something to teach and learn from each other. We invest heavily in learning sessions, sharing insights, and reflecting on our growth.
* You're interested in understanding how companies grow, and how data plays a role \\- Unlocking the secrets of data is our bread and butter. How do successful companies grow? How do different types of businesses create value for users in an economically scalable way?
