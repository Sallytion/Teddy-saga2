 SPAN develops products that accelerate the rapid adoption of renewable energy in the home. The flagship SPAN Smart Panel is the first true evolution for the traditional home electric panel, harnessing enhanced technology for metering, monitoring, and control. An expanded product suite of intelligent, integrated solutions radically lowers the cost and complexity of energy upgrades–including solar, batteries and EVs–empowering homeowners to be active, resilient and informed players in the energy market.
   

  

**The Team and Role**
 SPAN’s Device Software team is responsible for all of the software that is physically embodied in our hardware products. Our first product \\- the SPAN Panel \\- contains a complex network of microcontrollers and a single board computer that must work together to react quickly to changing conditions with impeccable reliability in order to perform its job. We look for friendly, excellent engineers who enjoy working with their peers to solve complex problems and prioritize trusting that the people we hire are capable of great things when well supported. Engineers work directly with the broader software, product, and hardware teams to ensure the right things get built at the right time.
   

  

 As an engineer on the Device Software team you will define and implement new features directly related to SPAN’s hardware products focusing on the lowest level \\- the microcontroller. This includes everything from bootloaders on systems without an OS up through applications in C and C\\+\\+ inside an RTOS. Hardware products are central to SPAN’s business and writing firmware for even our smallest microcontrollers means working on something that directly impacts the user experience. You will own large user\\-facing features from conception through implementation on future hardware products, working independently to bring them to completion.
   

  

**Representative Projects**
* Designing an OTA system that encompasses a variety of communication interfaces, processor types, and products, while achieving both secure goals for hardware\\-backed encryption and verification and high reliability.
* Working with system architects to invent a data steaming architecture for a new product family which can satisfy both the needs of the data science team to access high rate and quality data, as well as safety guarantees around consistency and accuracy.
* Representing the Device Software team in group settings and evangelizing engineering best practices. Participating in code and design reviews as well as authoring documents which further reinforce these goals, and supporting engineers across the org in hitting them.


**About You**
**Required Qualifications**
 We are seeking a Firmware/Embedded Linux engineer with:
   

  

* 5 or more years of experience writing software for a hardware device (on a microcontroller, and/or in Linux, etc) in C\\+\\+ or C
* Strong fundamentals in modern software design with tools like Object\\-Oriented design, coupled with awareness of concerns like manual memory management
* Experience working with standard electrical communication interfaces like UART, I2C, USB, etc
* Exceptional interpersonal communication and collaboration skills. Great at building trust and driving decisions to a resolution
* Track record of taking ownership over projects and willingness to help others with theirs, from design and code review through to mentorship of new employees


**Bonus Qualifications**
 We do not expect any engineer to have all skills, but we do want you to be excited to learn and grow. Every Device Software Engineer is free to roam up and down our device software stack, so any combination of the following skills is welcome but not required.
   

  

* Experience with the STM32 microcontroller family
* Experience with functional safety and processes and standards like UL 60730, ISO 26262, IEC 61508, and UL 1998
* Experience writing higher level system or application software such as diagnostic command line tools or the application side of a communication interface
* Wireless technologies like WiFi, Bluetooth and Zigbee
* Hands\\-on experience with electronics lab equipment
* Clean energy hardware in a multidisciplinary environment.","Renewable Energy Equipment Manufacturing","https://www.linkedin.com/company/spanio","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQGBc_-WEHCAbQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1661280579328/spanio_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=s4pLXD31Oox5kgvwuxXrwsZadCsiERLUIopT03erYlA","","","","","","","","","","",""

* TimeBack: An educational platform driving Alpha School's 2\\-hour learning model (99th percentile test outcomes).
* Incept: A content generation platform producing all personalized educational material for multiple learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
* Crossover: An AI\\-driven hiring platform handling tens of thousands of applicants monthly, staffing schools and companies worldwide.


 You will take ownership of one platform and dedicate the majority of your time to constructing the most complex sections of the codebase with a compact team (3\\-5 experienced engineers, no junior members). The architectural choices you make will dictate whether other teams can quickly build new applications, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Correct decisions unlock significant leverage. Poor decisions generate integration chaos and destroy velocity across numerous teams.
   

  

 You design what you build and operate. You set quality standards and define patterns for your platform. We follow a spec\\-driven approach: design precedes implementation, planning comes before building. High autonomy, no committees, no review boards. A small, cohesive team where accountability for your deliverables rests with you.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Drive strategic architectural choices and define technical patterns for the team to adopt.
* AI Leadership: Champion the adoption of emerging AI workflows and develop high\\-impact playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the intricate, high\\-stakes components of the codebase working directly with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify that your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality standards.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Serving as an architect without hands\\-on implementation
* Becoming trapped in continuous meetings
* Managing personnel (this role focuses on technical leadership, not people management responsibilities)
* Maintaining legacy systems or internal IT infrastructure


**Basic Requirements**
**Technical Lead key responsibilities**
* A minimum of 5 years of professional software development experience creating software products
* A minimum of 3 years serving as either a lead engineer (conducting code reviews for others) or architect (driving critical technical decisions)
* Background working on platform\\-level products where your APIs were consumed by other teams
* Strong engagement with AI tools, consistently experimenting and exploring new possibilities


**About LearnWith.AI**
 LearnWith.AI is an edtech startup that leverages AI and subject matter experts to cultivate a new way of learning. Our unique approach leverages 50\\+ years of learning science, cutting\\-edge data analytics and AI\\-powered coaching. In doing so, we can help students learn more, learn faster, and learn better \\- and have fun while doing it. We are a remote\\-first company that hires globally via Crossover.
   

  

 There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!
   

  

**Working with us**
 This is a full\\-time (40 hours per week), long\\-term position. The position is immediately available and requires entering into an independent contractor agreement with Crossover as a Contractor of Record. The compensation level for this role is $100 USD/hour, which equates to $200,000 USD/year assuming 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. The payment period is weekly.
