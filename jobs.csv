* Run POCs and pilots: plan success criteria, lead integrations on gateway/telematics ECUs, and de‑risk production rollouts with measurable outcomes and handover plans.
* Create enablement: author reference architectures, playbooks, and best practices; deliver workshops for internal teams, partners, and customers.
* Be the field’s voice into Product: synthesize feedback from deployments; influence roadmaps for reliability, diagnostics depth, observability, and developer experience.
* Support go‑to‑market: contribute to RFPs/SOWs, quantify value (quality, uptime, warranty, and TCO impact), and present technical material to senior engineering and compliance stakeholders.
* Champion interoperability: advise on integrations with customer clouds and partner ecosystems (e.g., Azure/GCP), data lakes, and enterprise systems.


**What You Should Know**
* 8\\+ years in automotive or embedded connectivity, including 3\\+ years designing OTA, telematics, or connected‑vehicle platforms at OEMs, Tier‑1s, or mobility fleets.
* Deep familiarity with vehicle networking \\& diagnostics: CAN/CAN‑FD, automotive Ethernet, SOME/IP; diagnostics protocols (UDS, DoIP, ISO‑TP) and their practical use in update and logging flows.
* Handson knowledge of OTA safety and reliability: fail‑safe/rollback patterns, secure boot/bootloaders, package signing, campaign gating, and ECU dependency management.
* Experience mapping systems to UNECE R155/R156 and preparing CSMS/SUMS evidence; working knowledge of ISO/SAE 21434 and ISO 24089 concepts.
* Cloud \\& data fluency: designing data pipelines (streaming \\& batch), data governance/retention, API design, observability, and secure device‑to‑cloud comms.
* Tooling: Vector/CANoe, Wireshark, protocol analyzers; issue tracking and documentation tools.
* Excellent communication—able to whiteboard complex ideas with architects one day and brief executives the next; comfortable with customer‑facing roles and light travel.


**Perks Of Joining The Sibros Team**
