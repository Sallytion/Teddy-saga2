**Description \\& Requirements**
 Bloomberg AIM (Asset and Investment Manager) is a buy\\-side trading platform used by some of the biggest asset managers in capital markets. Our platform is a one\\-stop shop that enables everything from idea generation to trade execution and post\\-trade operations. It’s a large scale system – built by more than 400 engineers – used to manage trillions of dollars each day by 930 global firms across over 80 countries. We’re the market leading platform, and Bloomberg continues to invest in our growth as a product and engineering team – that’s where you come in!
   

  

**Our Team**
 In the Compliance team, we tackle problems associated with large distributed systems such as latency and scaling, balanced with the need for reliability and accuracy required for a business\\-critical system. Over the next 2\\-3 years, we have multiple projects focused on keeping our clients ahead of the competition as well as organically rebuilding the platform in order to serve the growing number of tier\\-1 clients with a global footprint that transact in volumes we currently cannot support. Solving problems on this scale is hard and we’re always looking for fresh ideas and new technologies to leverage.
   

  

 What’s in it for you?
   

  

 The Compliance team builds systems which ensure that every transaction happening across the entire AIM platform is checked against 10s of thousands of rules. These rules ensure that no market regulation is violated, no illicit/manipulative activity is performed, and no activity that would put the client at financial risk takes place. We additionally provide the necessary tools to define and manage rules as well as deal with violations and provide trading supervisory overrides where applicable. Because our systems are in the critical path of real\\-time trading, throughput, latency and correctness are of paramount importance.
   

  

 The impact of the Compliance product spans further than just AIM as it is also being used by the Sell\\-Side OMS (TOMS), various execution platforms and portfolio optimizers. AIM Rules Management team is a core team under Compliance providing a solution for Creation, Business intelligence, Audit, Reporting, Automation of Compliance Rules. Our team works closely with our business counterparts and quality engineering teams in an Agile environment. Our development processes include daily scrum, sprint planning, Github, developing unit/regression tests, conducting code reviews and automated coverage tests and CI/CD pipeline.
   

  

**We'll Trust You To**
* Think outside the box and re\\-architect the Rules system with a goal to add safeguards
* Improve discoverability of rules, attributes and templates by using NLP, semantic search
* Improve system audit, reduce time to market of new Regulatory rule templates and settings
* Improve scalability and reliability of the system and reduce complexity to onboard newer workflows
* Partner with other Engineering teams, Product, Sales to scale the system to Tier 1 clients


**You'll Need To Have**
* 8\\+ years of demonstrated experience working with C/C\\+\\+ and Python and the willingness to work with them as your primary languages
* Ability to take ownership of the complete SDLC, from meeting with the business to implementing solutions
* Experience in system design, architecting, and developing software that is high quality, modular, stable and scalable
* Experience working with a variety of open\\-source technologies such as TypeScript, Pytest, Docker, Humio, and others
* Passion for finding opportunities to use new technology to improve stability and performance
* Applied critical thinking and problem solving skills to solve business problems


**We'd Love To See**
* Experience with technical leadership and taking various initiatives
* Experience within the finance industry, particularly understanding of trading and banking workflows
* Curiosity about Compliance, Portfolio management, and Trading and how our clients use it
* Enthusiasm to drive discussions, share new ideas, and promote best practice on the team

 At Kyndryl, we design, build, manage and modernize the mission\\-critical technology systems that the world depends on every day. So why work at Kyndryl? We are always moving forward – always pushing ourselves to go further in our efforts to build a more equitable, inclusive world for our employees, our customers and our communities.
   

  

**The Role**
 Infrastructure Specialists at Kyndryl are project\\-based subject matter experts in all things infrastructure – good at providing analysis, documenting and diagraming work for hand\\-off, offering timely solutions, and generally “figuring it out.” This is a hands\\-on role where your feel for the interaction between a system and its environment will be invaluable to every one of your clients.
   

  

 There are two halves to this role: First, contributing to current projects where you analyze problems and tech issues, offer solutions, and test, modify, automate, and integrate systems. And second, long\\-range strategic planning of IT infrastructure and operational execution. This role isn’t specific to any one platform, so you’ll need a good feel for all of them. And because of this, you’ll experience variety and growth at Kyndryl that you won’t find anywhere else.
   

  

 You’ll be involved early to offer solutions, help decide whether something can be done, and identify the technical and timeline risks up front. This means dealing with both client expectations and internal challenges – in other words, there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference, and a lot of people will witness your contributions. In fact, a frequent sign of success for our Infrastructure Specialists is when clients come back to us and ask for the same person by name. That’s the kind of impact you can have!
   

  

 This is a project\\-based role where you’ll enjoy deep involvement throughout the lifespan of a project, as well as the chance to work closely with Architects, Technicians, and PMs. Whatever your current level of tech savvy or where you want your career to lead, you’ll find the right opportunities and a buddy to support your growth. Boredom? Trust us, that won’t be an issue.
   

  

 Your future at Kyndryl
   

  

 There are lots of opportunities to gain certification and qualifications on the job, and you’ll continuously grow as a Cloud Hyperscaler. Many of our Infrastructure Specialists are on a path toward becoming either an Architect or Distinguished Engineer, and there are opportunities at every skill level to grow in either of these directions.
   

  

**Who You Are**
 You’re good at what you do and possess the required experience to prove it. However, equally as important – you have a growth mindset; keen to drive your own personal and professional development. You are customer\\-focused – someone who prioritizes customer success in their work. And finally, you’re open and borderless – naturally inclusive in how you work with others.
   

  

**Required Technical And Professional Experience**
* 6\\+ years of z/OS system programming experience covering work, user, journal, and performance management.
* Manage z/OS OS and related IBM/ISV products: installation, upgrades, customization, and maintenance via SMP/E and non\\-SMP/E.

* Create and maintain REXX and Assembler scripts.
* Implement security and monitor z/OS/software to resolve issues proactively.
* Provide support for z/OS planning, installations, and upgrades, including root cause analysis for system/product issues.

* Participate in Disaster Recovery planning/tests; lead daily Ops meetings if no P1 incidents.
* Identify and address problem trends.
* Demonstrated knowledge: z/OS, Unix System Services, SMP/E, REXX, Java, VSAM, third\\-party products, BRMS, tape management, ATL/VTL.

* Strong grasp of SMP/E, WLM, RMF, HCD, ISV products, REXX, Assembler, JCL.

* Technical guidance and support for high availability and disaster recovery enhancements.
* Evaluate and recommend software changes to meet organisational needs.
* Excellent troubleshooting and customer service.
* Infrastructure/Application issue resolution for ZOS.


**Being You**
 Diversity is a whole lot more than what we look like or where we come from, it’s how we think and who we are. We welcome people of all cultures, backgrounds, and experiences. But we’re not doing it single\\-handily: Our Kyndryl Inclusion Networks are only one of many ways we create a workplace where all Kyndryls can find and provide support and advice. This dedication to welcoming everyone into our company means that Kyndryl gives you – and everyone next to you – the ability to bring your whole self to work, individually and collectively, and support the activation of our equitable culture.
