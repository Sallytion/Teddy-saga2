 Operational excellence at Trilogy is not optional—it's a competitive edge. We acquire software businesses rapidly and accelerate their growth even more quickly.

 You will take full ownership of transformations spanning our global portfolio.

**What You Won’t Be Doing**

"li-4326513781","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4326513781","","Senior Quality Assurance Automation Engineer, IgniteTech (Remote) - $100,000/year USD","Crossover","Pune, Maharashtra, India","","fulltime","","","","","",True,"mid-senior level","Engineering, Information Technology, and Quality Assurance","","","The software sector continues to struggle with prolonged release timelines and defect\\-laden products, primarily because of legacy testing approaches. Conventional QA methods, including rudimentary automation, often miss critical defects until it's too late, resulting in expensive setbacks and dissatisfied end users. Industry data indicates that more than 60% of software defects are identified after release, and quality\\-related failures impose costs exceeding $2 trillion annually on the software industry worldwide. The push for swifter, more dependable software necessitates a fundamental transformation in quality assurance methodology.
   

  

 IgniteTech is spearheading this transformation by embedding GenAI capabilities throughout the entire QA lifecycle. Through the strategic use of AI to replicate user interactions, create sophisticated test scenarios, and examine defect patterns, we achieve accelerated delivery cycles with reduced bug counts. Becoming part of our team positions you at the cutting edge of this innovation, leveraging AI to remove bottlenecks and anticipate issues before they materialize.
   

  

 This position diverges from conventional QA roles. If you seek an environment centered on manual test case execution or monotonous automation scripting, this opportunity is not suitable for you. In this role, you will take ownership of designing and advancing AI\\-powered test automation frameworks, apply predictive analytics to uncover latent risks, and contribute to defining the next generation of software quality. You will serve as the architect of adaptable solutions that respond to the demands of contemporary development, rather than functioning within a static, traditional structure. If this aligns with the challenge you've been seeking, submit your application now to influence the trajectory of software development.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Design and sustain AI\\-powered test automation frameworks that produce test cases, scripts, and datasets for thorough validation
* Leverage GenAI technologies to evaluate test results, detect defect patterns, and deliver actionable recommendations for ongoing enhancement
* Replicate user interactions, stress scenarios, and boundary conditions to detect potential defects before they affect end users


**Senior Quality Assurance Automation Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Leverage AI and automation technologies to enable accelerated product launches and reduced defect rates


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your natural approach is to write code initially and subsequently use AI tools to validate or refine your code, instead of beginning with AI, then this role is not appropriate for you)
* A minimum of 2 years of professional experience in a QA automation capacity
* Strong capability in Selenium and at least one of these languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
* Hands\\-on professional experience applying AI tools to automate QA processes
* Working knowledge of CI/CD systems, including Jenkins or GitHub Actions
