* Are you a born problem solver who loves to figure out how something works?
* Are you a CI/CD geek who loves all things automation?
* Do you have a low tolerance for manual work and look to automate everything you can?


 Business Operations is leading the DevOps transformation at Mastercard through our tooling and by being an advocate for change \\& standards throughout the development, quality, release, and product organizations. We need team members with an appetite for change and pushing the boundaries of what can be done with automation. Experience in working across development, operations, and product teams to prioritize needs and to build relationships is a must.
   

  

 Role
   

  

 The role of business operations is to be the production readiness steward for the platform. This is accomplished by closely partnering with developers to design, build, implement, and support technology services.
   

  

 A business operations engineer will ensure operational criteria like system availability, capacity, performance, monitoring, self\\-healing, and deployment automation are implemented throughout the delivery process. Business Operations plays a key role in leading the DevOps transformation at Mastercard through our tooling and by being an advocate for change and standards throughout the development, quality, release, and product organisations.
   

  

 We accomplish this transformation through supporting daily operations with a hyper\\-focus on triage and then root cause by understanding the business impact of our products. The goal of every biz ops team is to shift left to be more proactive and upfront in the development process and to proactively manage production and change activities to maximize customer experience and increase the overall value of supported applications.
   

  

 Biz Ops teams also focus on risk management by tying all our activities together with an overarching responsibility for compliance and risk mitigation across all our environments. A biz ops focus is also on streamlining and standardizing traditional application specific support activities and centralizing points of interaction for both internal and external partners by communicating effectively with all key stakeholders.
   

  

 Ultimately, the role of biz ops is to align Product and Customer Focused priorities with Operational needs. We regularly review our run state not only from an internal perspective but also understanding and providing the feedback loop to our development partners on how we can improve the customer experience of our applications.

* Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
* Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
* Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
