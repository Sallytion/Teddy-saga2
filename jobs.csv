**Description \\& Requirements**
**Our Team**
 Comdb2 is a Bloomberg\\-developed, open source relational database system, powering approximately 77,000 active databases at Bloomberg across a wide range of use cases supporting over 80% of Bloomberg's data store. The Comdb2 Platform Engineering team ensures continuous availability, high performance, and feature stability for all Comdb2 instances while keeping them modern, scalable, and user friendly for both individual engineers and enterprise level workloads.
   

  

 Our team plays a pivotal role in supporting the daily workflows of more than 9,000 software engineers at Bloomberg. With Comdb2 serving a global userbase across the entire Engineering organization, we're excited to expand our footprint by launching a new Comdb2 Platform Engineering team in Pune, India.
   

  

 Collaboration is central to our approach. By engaging with a wide range of engineering teams across Bloomberg, we gain valuable insights and a well\\-rounded understanding of the broader engineering environment. These partnerships help us stay aligned with evolving needs and contribute meaningfully across the organization.
   

  

**What's the role?**
 As a member of the Comdb2 Platform Engineering team, you will work as a Software Engineer to design and implement the software that drives our database platform’s stability and its entire operational lifecycle. We are looking for a Software Engineer who leverages SRE principles to build the scalable, automated systems that keep our global infrastructure running smoothly. This requires a unique balance: applying a long\\-term reliability mindset to hands\\-on systems engineering. By bridging these two disciplines, you will solve complex problems that span distributed systems, capacity management, performance optimization, and global automation.
   

  

 It’s a role for engineers who thrive in environments where having both a reliability mindset and a strong command of database systems are essential—and where the impact is felt across thousands of services and engineers globally.
   

  

**We'll Trust You To**
 Cover the following responsibilities as a Software Engineer with a strong focus on reliability:
   

  

* Design and implement observability enhancements for tracking SLOs/SLIs, monitoring, alerting, and dashboards for database systems
* Build intuitive tools and automation for provisioning, scaling, failover, backup and recovery of databases
* Manage system security including user roles, permissions, and compliance controls
* Collaborate with engineering and DevOps teams to design resilient database architectures, sophisticated testing frameworks and robust CI/CD pipelines
* Participate in on\\-call rotations to support database\\-related incidents and outages, and improve system reliability through incident analysis and blameless postmortems
* Provide guidance, best practices and recommendations to database owners regarding performance tuning, query optimization, and capacity planning
* Support database schema design, migrations, and data lifecycle management


**You'll Need To Have**
* Demonstrated operational awareness and a strong reliability\\-first mindset, with the ability to anticipate, detect, and mitigate issues across large\\-scale systems
* 4\\+ years of demonstrated software engineering experience with object\\-oriented programming languages such as Python
* Willingness to wear multiple hats as a Software Engineer focused on reliability
* Solid knowledge of Linux internals, networking, and Infrastructure as Code


**We'd Love To See**
* Experience managing databases in Kubernetes or other containerized environments
* Experience in at least one RDBMS (Comdb2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle) and/or NoSQL platform (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra)
* Knowledge of replication, sharding, and multiregional deployment strategies
* Experience leading or being the founding member of a newly established team
* Experience with C and/or C\\+\\+


**If This Sounds Like You**
 Apply if you think we're a good match. We'll get in touch to let you know what the next steps are, but in the meantime, feel free to have a look at this:
