 Customer and internal support operations are the next frontier for AI\\-driven transformation. We don't view support as a cost center; we view it as a high\\-leverage engineering problem.
 **We believe that extraordinary customer service is our ultimate competitive advantage.** 
 While others see support as a backlog to manage, we see it as a product to refine—turning every customer interaction into a moment of high\\-precision, frictionless delight that builds a lasting moat for the company.
   

  

 This is a high\\-velocity implementation role. You will be shipping code that directly impacts our global support metrics and our competitive standing in the market. You’ll spend your time building the automation for non\\-support inquiries, refining agentic email flows, and ensuring that our AI\\-native operating model delivers a level of service that is fundamentally unreachable by traditional teams.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Build AI\\-Native Support Tooling: Develop and scale the internal applications that power automated email responses, ticket triaging, and non\\-support inquiry resolutions.
* Orchestrate Agent Collaborations: Lead the technical integration between our internal AI fleet and external agent interfaces (like Ava) to resolve complex, multi\\-step support issues autonomously.
* Deterministic Data Engineering: Ensure support excellence by prioritizing determinism at the data layer. You will build the serialization formats and context\\-retrieval systems that provide agents with the exact information needed for high\\-precision outcomes.
* Optimization \\& Benchmarking: Implement a culture of systemic experimentation. You will run evals on support\\-specific workflows, ensuring that every update to an integration or prompt increases the accuracy and speed of our global operations.
* Engineering for Service Excellence: Design features that enable ""extraordinary"" service—focusing on reducing time\\-to\\-resolution to near\\-zero while maintaining a level of personalization and accuracy that manual workflows could never achieve.
* Global Scale \\& Reliability: Partner with the US and Israel\\-based teams to ensure that support tooling is resilient, secure, and integrated into our core telemetry and drift detection frameworks.


**What We’re Looking For**
* The Integration Expert: You are a Senior Software Engineer with a track record of building complex internal tools and third\\-party integrations (SaaS APIs, CRM systems, etc.).
* A Product\\-Minded Builder: You are passionate about building tools that solve real human problems. You understand that in support, a saved minute for an agent is a massive win for the company.
* The ""Moat"" Builder: You recognize that engineering superior service is a strategic differentiator. You are driven by the goal of making our customer experience so fast and accurate that it becomes a key reason users choose us over competitors.
* Systems Thinker: You look beyond the individual ticket. You see patterns in workflows and know how to abstract them into repeatable, automated AI microservices.
* We are building a highly sophisticated, AI\\-native support engine for our global operations. If you want to be the engineer who defines how a global company supports its users at scale and creates a lasting competitive advantage through service excellence, let’s talk.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/navan","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEnYNXyO5yOyw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1680444954701?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=_fp72zjQM-K4EiciWIhXH9ysSqlbf6AMTF04ntoEFWM","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non\\-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.","Software Development, IT Services and IT Consulting, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/salesforce","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qTOWgVlA05Oyq4_yQSi790-w_uu88NQ3SNcgh9xl738","","","","","","","","","","",""
