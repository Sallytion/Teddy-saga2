**This is a great fit if you love building from scratch and taking products from 0 → 1 → n.** 




  





**What You’ll Do** 



* Own products end\\-to\\-end: Design and build core systems across our AI stack (search, knowledge graph, internal tools, platforms).
* Ship 0 → 1 products: Work from vague problem statements to live products \\- defining scope, making tradeoffs, and iterating quickly based on real usage.
* Build with AI: Integrate and orchestrate LLMs and other AI services into products that solve real workflows for founders and investors.
* Collaborate deeply with users: Work directly with SPC partners and founders in the community, understand their workflows, and translate those into product and technical decisions.
* Own quality \\& reliability: Design systems that are observable, testable, and maintainable; drive improvements in performance and reliability as usage scales.



  





**What We’re Looking For** 



* Strong backend experience with Python (e.g., FastAPI, Django, Flask) and/or JavaScript/TypeScript (e.g., React / Next.js).
* Have taken at least one meaningful product or system from 0 → 1 (startup, side project, or within a larger company).

* Comfortable with cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure), databases, and CI/CD.

**Why This Role Is Unique** 



* Unmatched exposure to top founders: You’ll work directly with hundreds of top 1% founders and operators across AI, infra, and frontier tech.

* High ownership, small team: You’ll be part of a small team on the ground in Bangalore, with massive influence on our stack, culture, and direction.
