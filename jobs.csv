Trusted by global brands like The Ridge, Hexclad, and Mejuri, we’re driving the future of e\\-commerce and wholesale at scale.
 



  





 Headquartered in the USA and Canada, with a vibrant engineering hub in Bangalore, Fulfil is where ambitious problem\\-solvers come to push boundaries, master their craft, and collaborate on mission\\-critical technology that impacts millions.
 



  





**Role: SDE (Python Full Stack \\& AI)** 




 As an SDE (Python Full Stack \\& AI) at Fulfil, you’ll design and build the next\\-generation systems that power millions of customer orders and financial transactions for some of the world’s fastest\\-growing merchants. Our Python\\-based platform handles massive scale—think millions of transactions per hour—and your work will ensure it’s robust, scalable, and maintainable.
 



  





 You’ll collaborate with a global team across the USA, Canada, and Bangalore, tackling sophisticated challenges in an environment that values clean code, innovative design, and collective problem\\-solving.
 



  





**What You’ll Do** 



* Own the Full Stack: Take charge of our entire Python\\-based platform—from front\\-end integrations to back\\-end systems—maintaining and scaling a codebase of millions of lines that powers global commerce.
* Ship Features Fast: Drive the rapid design, development, and deployment of new features, delivering value to high\\-growth merchants at breakneck speed.

 , powering natural language interfaces, intelligent automation, and merchant\\-facing insights (e.g., Fulfil x MCP integrations with Claude).
* Focus on
 **applied AI for commerce operations** 
 — integrating models to solve real problems like order management, financial analysis, customer insights, and logistics optimization.



**What We Don’t** 



* We are
 **not** 
 a core ML/AI research company — we don’t train or fine\\-tune foundation models.
* We focus on
