Even with basic automation, conventional QA methods struggle to identify critical defects early, resulting in expensive delays and dissatisfied end users. Industry data reveals that more than 60% of software bugs surface after release, and quality\\-related defects impose annual costs exceeding $2 trillion on the software sector. Meeting the demand for faster, more dependable software requires a fundamental shift in quality assurance strategy.
   

  

 IgniteTech is pioneering this transformation by embedding GenAI capabilities throughout the QA lifecycle. We leverage AI to replicate user interactions, create sophisticated test scenarios, and interpret defect patterns—enabling quicker releases with reduced bug counts. Joining our team positions you at the cutting edge of innovation, where AI eliminates waste and anticipates issues before they materialize.
   

  

 This position goes beyond conventional QA roles. If you seek an environment centered on manual test runs or repetitive scripting tasks, this opportunity is not suited for you. In this role, you will take ownership of building and advancing AI\\-powered test automation frameworks, apply predictive analytics to surface latent risks, and contribute to defining the next era of software quality. You will architect scalable systems designed for the realities of contemporary development—not function as a component in an inflexible, legacy workflow.

Conventional QA approaches, including those with rudimentary automation, consistently miss critical defects until it is too late, resulting in expensive setbacks and dissatisfied end users. Industry data indicates that more than 60% of software defects surface after release, and quality\\-related failures impose costs exceeding $2 trillion annually on the global software industry. Delivering faster, more dependable software requires a fundamental shift in quality assurance strategy.
   

  

 IgniteTech is driving this transformation by embedding GenAI capabilities throughout the entire QA lifecycle. We leverage AI to replicate user interactions, create sophisticated test scenarios, and examine defect patterns, enabling accelerated releases with reduced bug counts. When you join our team, you position yourself at the cutting edge of innovation, using AI to remove bottlenecks and anticipate issues before they materialize.
   

  

 This is not a conventional QA role. If your expectation is a traditional setting focused on manual test runs or routine automation scripting, this position will not meet your needs. In this role, you will take ownership of designing and advancing AI\\-powered test automation architectures, apply predictive analytics to surface concealed risks, and contribute to defining the next generation of software quality. You will serve as the architect of adaptable solutions that respond to the demands of contemporary development, rather than functioning as a component in a static, legacy workflow. If this aligns with the challenge you have been seeking, submit your application now to influence the trajectory of software development.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Design and sustain AI\\-driven test automation frameworks that produce test cases, scripts, and datasets for thorough validation
* Apply GenAI technologies to evaluate testing results, detect defect patterns, and deliver actionable recommendations for ongoing enhancement
* Model user interactions, load conditions, and boundary scenarios to reveal potential failures before they affect end users


**Senior Quality Assurance Automation Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Leverage AI and automation technologies to accelerate product release cycles and reduce product defect rates


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your default approach is to write code first and subsequently use AI tools to verify or refine your code, rather than the reverse, then please do not apply)
* A minimum of 2 years of experience in a QA automation capacity, including hands\\-on experience testing AI products
* Proficiency in Selenium and one of the following programming languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
* Professional experience applying AI tools to automate QA processes
* Working knowledge of CI/CD platforms, such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions
* Experience in leading QA testing teams
