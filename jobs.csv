**Location:** 
  India (on\\-site, hands\\-on)
 



**Type:** 
  Full\\-time
 



**Experience:** 
  3\\-5 years (hardware / systems preferred)
   





**What You'll Actually Do** 




 This is not a “PM” role. You will own the 
 **physical farming module** 
  end\\-to\\-end. Design, cost, reliability, and scalability.
 



  





 You will:
 



  




* Design and iterate modular vertical farming systems (racks, plumbing, lighting, pumps, sensors)
* Build fast prototypes and test them in real operating environments
* Own BOM cost targets and continuously reduce system cost without compromising reliability
* Work closely with growers to translate crop requirements into hardware constraints
* Select, manage, and push local vendors and fabricators
* Define installation, maintenance, and failure\\-handling SOPs
* Say 
 **no** 
  to unnecessary complexity, over\\-engineering, and “cool but useless” features



  





 If something fails at a customer site, you are accountable, not in a meeting, but on the ground.
 



  





**What success looks like ( first 6 months )** 



* A standardized v1/v2 farm module that runs 24/7 with minimal intervention
* BOM cost and failure points reduced meaningfully from the first prototype
* Installation and maintenance simple enough for ops teams to execute repeatedly
* Clear system constraints that sales and ops cannot break



  





**Who this role is for** 




 You’re likely a good fit if you have:
 



  




* 3 \\- 5 years building 
 **real\\-world hardware systems** 
  (industrial equipment, automation, HVAC, EV hardware, water systems, medical devices, cold chain, robotics, etc.)
* Experience taking products from prototype → field deployment
* Strong understanding of electrical, mechanical, and fluid systems
* Hands\\-on experience working with Indian vendors and fabrication ecosystems
* Obsession with cost, reliability, and simplification



  





 You enjoy shipping imperfect systems, learning fast, and making them better.
 



  





**Who this role is NOT for** 




 Please 
 **do not apply** 
  if:
 


* You’re a pure software engineer or data scientist
* You’ve only worked on simulations, research, or academic projects
* You’re looking for a “strategy” or “innovation” role
* You need perfect specs before building anything
* You want to manage people instead of systems (at least initially)



  





**What we care about ( more than resumes )** 



* You’ve debugged failures in the field
* You’ve shipped something imperfect that actually worked
* You think in systems, not features
* You can argue your point and still change your mind when data says so
* You care about unit economics, not just elegance



  





**What We Offer** 



* Full ownership of a core product that will be deployed in the real world
* Direct access to the founder and decision\\-making authority
* Competitive compensation \\+ meaningful equity
* The chance to define how urban farming systems are built for India



  





**How to apply** 




 Please share:
 


* Your resume or LinkedIn profile
* **1\\-2 short examples** 
  of hardware systems you’ve personally built, shipped, or supported in the field
* A brief note on 
 **what you enjoy building** 
  and 
 **what you avoid building**

 PlayOps is creating a global simulation to replace résumés with real proof of skill, behavior, and action.
 



 This isn’t a traditional internship — it’s an invitation to help build the infrastructure behind a new proof economy.
 



  





 You’ll join a live ARG (Alternate Reality Game) \\+ documentary ecosystem and work inside a fast, evolving world where systems, missions, and prototypes turn into real infrastructure.
 



  





**What is PlayOps?** 




 PlayOps is a global ARG where everything unfolds inside Telegram — no app downloads, no video calls, no friction. Daily missions, story drops, and puzzles feed into the documentary arc.
 



  





 Players can also opt into becoming “characters,” with AI Twin versions of themselves appearing in the cinematic episodes (optional).
 



  





 This developer track sits inside the same world — but focuses on building systems, bots, and Mini Apps that power the Grid (our new proof layer).
 



  





**Your Role** 




 You will join the live world and simultaneously build real infrastructure:
 



  • Take 1 mission per day (30–60 min).
 



  • Prototype interfaces, flows, or system logic based on mission prompts.
 



  • Build and test Telegram Bots and Mini Apps used by thousands of players.
 



  • Work with Decoders, UX Architects, Story Builders, and System Designers.
 



  • Contribute to the Grid — the backend proof\\-of\\-action system.
 



  • (Optional) Appear in documentary content or as an AI twin.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities** 




 You will develop Telegram\\-native systems end\\-to\\-end:
 



  





**Bot \\+ Mini App Development** 




  • Build and deploy robust Telegram Bots using Bot API \\+ frameworks (Telegraf, aiogram).
 



  • Build a responsive Telegram Mini App (Web App) using Telegram Web Apps SDK.
 



  • Implement deep linking, server\\-side auth, and seamless mini\\-app ↔️ bot communication.
 



  





**Full\\-Stack System Build** 




  • Create secure backend systems (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI).
 



  • Design and manage databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or similar).
 



  • Build APIs, logging, user auth, and data structures for proof submission.
 



  • Ensure scalability, performance, and clean documentation.
 



  





**Integration \\+ Architecture** 




  • Connect narrative missions to real system outputs.
 



  • Turn broken “Feed” mechanics into structured Grid systems.
 



  • Prototype proof logging, validator tools, and runtime decision systems.
 



  





**Required Skills** 




**Must\\-haves:** 




  • Proven Full\\-Stack experience (React \\+ Node.js or React \\+ FastAPI).
 



  • Telegram Bot development experience (telegraf, aiogram, or custom Bot API integrations).
 



  • Hands\\-on experience with Telegram Web Apps SDK (Mini Apps).
 



  • Strong frontend proficiency (React.js).
 



  • Strong backend proficiency (Node/Express OR Python/FastAPI).
 



  • Database experience (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, or similar).
 



  • Comfortable deploying on AWS, DigitalOcean, Render, etc.
 



  • Able to work independently with minimal guidance.
 



  





**Nice to Have** 




  • A portfolio of live Telegram Bots or Mini Apps (strongly preferred).
 



  • TypeScript experience.
 



  • Experience with Redis or caching layers.
 



  • Familiarity with Telegram Payments API.
 



  • Understanding of Stars, TON, or blockchain\\-based reward flows.
 



  





**Expected Weekly Time** 




  • 24\\-28 hours/week
 



  • Missions: 30–60 minutes per day
 



  • Builds are flexible around your schedule
 



  





**Compensation** 




  





 This is an unpaid 12\\-week creative \\+ technical internship.
 



  





 High\\-performing developers will be considered for full\\-time engineering roles following the program.
 



  





 You will receive:
 



  • A verified PlayOps builder profile
 



  • XP, badges, and proof\\-of\\-work logs
 



  • Global credit in the documentary \\+ YouTube/Roku episodes
 



  • A real portfolio of bots, systems, and interfaces you authored inside a running ARG
 



  





**How to Apply** 




  





 Send:
 



  1\\. Resume/CV \\+ LinkedIn
 



  2\\. Links to previous Telegram Bots or Mini Apps
 



  3\\. GitHub or open\\-source contributions (if applicable)
