The work is not consumer\\-facing, and most of it is not public. We operate with a high bar for correctness, discretion, and long\\-horizon thinking.
 



  





**Role Description** 




 You will work on the implementation and validation of financial models used to reason about transactions, risk, and system behavior across different market environments.
 



 The role sits at the intersection of software engineering and analytical modeling. Rather than building user\\-facing tools or production trading systems, the work focuses on translating conceptual and quantitative models into reliable, testable software artifacts. Emphasis is placed on correctness, internal consistency, and the faithful representation of assumptions.
 



 This is not an application development role. The objective is to ensure that financial reasoning is expressed precisely in code, and that model behavior remains interpretable and stable as conditions change.
 



  





**Responsibilities** 



* **Model Implementation:** 
 Translate financial and economic models into clear, well\\-structured software implementations.
* **Assumption Encoding:** 
 Ensure that model assumptions, constraints, and boundary conditions are explicitly represented in code.
* **Validation \\& Testing:** 
 Design tests and diagnostics to detect inconsistencies, edge cases, and failure modes in model behavior.
* **Scenario Analysis:** 
 Support analysis across varying inputs, regimes, and stress conditions without overfitting or optimization bias.
* **Technical Documentation:** 
 Produce precise internal documentation that explains model structure, limitations, and intended use.



  





**Qualifications** 



* **Education:** 
 Bachelor’s degree or higher in Economics, Finance, Mathematics, Computer Science, or a related field.
* **Programming Ability:** 
 Proficiency in at least one general\\-purpose programming language (e.g., Python, C\\+\\+, Java) used for analytical work.
* **Quantitative Reasoning:** 
 Strong grounding in financial modeling, applied mathematics, or econometrics.
* **Analytical Judgment:** 
 Ability to reason about models as representations, not predictors, and to articulate their limits.
* **Experience:** 
 Experience implementing analytical or financial models in a research or professional setting is a plus.","Financial Services","https://www.linkedin.com/company/stealth-mode-startup-company-fintech","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGunUMHWOw6tw/company-logo_100_100/B4EZtJJp5HJ4AQ-/0/1766458827044/stealth_mode_startup_company_fintech_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=VlmCC2ZWXAESHonYtssXQDGaiA3CrgIovQf-Wx_TJz0","","","","","","","","","","",""
