* Integrate AI services and agents into backend workflows (tool routers, retrieval, safety/guardrails).
* If you’re frontend\\-leaning (primary):
* Build accessible, performant React/ Next.js apps with clean state and design systems.
* Implement real\\-time UX for risk/fraud dashboards, ops consoles, and customer features.
* Integrate agentic\\-AI UX (multi\\-step plans, tool traces, explanations, feedback loops) with secure server boundaries.


**Minimum Qualifications**
* 3\\-5 years professional experience (or equivalent) building production software.
* Excellent proficiency in either frontend or backend, and working ability across the other side.
* Solid CS fundamentals (DSA, concurrency, network \\& HTTP, caching, DB design).

**What Success Looks Like (First 90 Days)**
* Ship a meaningful feature end\\-to\\-end (API → UI) with observability and docs.
* Integrate or improve an agentic flow (tool orchestration \\+ evaluation) that measurably improves a KPI (e.g., time\\-to\\-resolution, approval rate, ops effort).
* Reduce a critical p99 or error rate by a concrete target through profiling and design fixes.
* Raise the bar via reviews, refactors, and reusable components/patterns.
