 We organize build work into four stacks:
 





 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮
 





 The foundation. Identity, cloud control planes, networking, security, reliability primitives.
 




  






 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺
 





 Shared capabilities. Data pipelines, AI/ML systems, agents, workflows, APIs.
 




  






 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁
 





 Delivery surfaces. Apps, APIs, interaction layers, conversational experiences.
 




  






 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲
 





 Domain intelligence. SecOps, Fraud, Asset, etc., where outcomes are defined.
 




  






 Every role has a 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀.
 





 That focus determines what you own long\\-term.
 




  






 𝗥𝘂𝗻 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀: 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗕𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲𝘀

 We use four run focus:
 





 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁
 





 How signals, data, and events enter the system safely.
 




  






 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲
 





 What work happens deterministically without humans.
 




  






 𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲
 





 How decisions are sequenced, governed, and escalated.
 




  






 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁
 





 How outcomes are delivered, explained, and consumed.
 




  






 Every role participates in one or more 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀.
 





 Some design them.
 





 Some operate within them.
 





 But no one builds without understanding how their work runs.

 AI is not a separate team or a feature for us.
 




  






 AI works 𝗮𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝘀 in both build and run:
 





 • generating code, configuration, and tests
 





 • exploring edge cases and failure modes
 





 • proposing decisions and explanations
 




  






 But AI never owns outcomes.
 




  






 Humans review.
 





 Humans decide.
 





 Humans are accountable.
 




  






 That’s intentional.
 




  






 𝗖𝗜 / 𝗖𝗗 / 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆
 





 CI/CD is not “everyone’s job”, and it’s not nobody’s job.
 





 • Roles with high blast radius (infra, platform) own pipelines and release safety.
 





 • Other roles participate by writing tests, respecting gates, and understanding rollout behavior.
 




  






 Shipping is expected.
 





 Shipping safely is designed.
 




  






 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻\\-𝗶𝗻\\-𝘁𝗵𝗲\\-𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
 





 This matters enough to say explicitly.
 




  






 In every role:
 





 • AI may assist
 





 • automation may execute
 





 • pipelines may deploy
 




  






 But a human is always responsible for:
 





 • approving changes
 





 • stopping unsafe behavior
 





 • owning consequences
 




  






 We design systems where judgment is not optional.","Data Infrastructure and Analytics","https://sg.linkedin.com/company/humanmanaged","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHxcED4IJd-EA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630649644440/humanmanaged_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=NiAz2_kXYsLWOW__Er0jpNPurErX-BJUxhGWJaXWbd4","","","","","","","","","","",""
