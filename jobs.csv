**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

 We are building a proprietary, industrial\\-grade AI platform to tackle the ""last mile"" of Generative AI:
 **guaranteeing correctness in complex domains.** 




 We are
 **not** 
 looking for a ""Prompt Engineer"" or an API integrator. We are seeking a
 **Research\\-Grade Engineer** 
 (Masters/PhD preferred) who combines deep theoretical knowledge of NLP with the ability to architect scalable, production\\-ready systems. You will function as the technical lead of this platform, working directly with the CTO to define the next generation of code intelligence.
 



 The Challenge
 



 Current LLMs are excellent at creativity but struggle with the strict logical consistency required for enterprise software. Your challenge is to bridge this gap. You will design systems that can handle
 **massive context windows** 
 , maintain
 **semantic integrity** 
 across thousands of files, and deliver
 **verifiable accuracy** 
 .
 



 You will define the methodologies to constrain Generative AI with strict structural rules, answering the hard question:
 *How do we build a system that possesses the flexibility of a neural network but the reliability of a compiler?* 




 What You Will Do
 


* **Architecture Design:** 
 Architect high\\-reliability inference systems that solve the ""hallucination problem"" inherent in Large Language Models. You will move beyond out\\-of\\-the\\-box solutions to build defensible, proprietary IP.
* **Advanced NLP Strategy:** 
 Define the strategy for domain adaptation and long\\-context reasoning. You will perform first\\-principles analysis to select the right approach (RAG, Fine\\-Tuning, or novel methods) based on rigorous benchmarking.
* **Evaluation \\& Verification:** 
 Design and build proprietary evaluation frameworks to rigorously measure the performance and safety of our models before they touch client code.
* **Technical Standards:** 
 Mentor the engineering team on the mathematical underpinnings of Transformer architectures and current SOTA research.



 What We Need (Must Haves)
 


* **Advanced Degree:** 
 Masters or PhD in Computer Science, AI, or related field (or equivalent top\\-tier research lab experience).
* **Advanced LLM Internals:** 
 You understand the specific failure modes of modern architectures regarding
 **long\\-context recall** 
 ,
 **reasoning drift** 
 , and
 **hallucination triggers** 
 in complex logic. You don't just fine\\-tune; you know how to mathematically constrain model outputs to ensure high\\-fidelity results.
* **Applied Research:** 
 8\\+ years of experience, with a track record of taking complex ML research and deploying it into production environments.
* **Beyond APIs:** 
 Proven expertise in architecting
 **autonomous agentic systems** 
 that go beyond simple retrieval. You have designed multi\\-agent orchestrators involving
 **planning, tool use (function calling), and self\\-correction loops** 
 to solve multi\\-step reasoning problems reliably.
* **Engineering Excellence:** 
 Strong proficiency in Python. You write clean, modular, object\\-oriented code, not just ""notebook scripts.""



 Preferred Experience
 


* Interest in
 **Code Generation** 
 ,
 **Program Analysis** 
 , or
 **Semantic Parsing** 
 .
* Experience with open\\-source LLM orchestration (LangChain, DSPy, LlamaIndex) but with a critical understanding of their limitations.
* Published research or technical blog posts on Applied NLP.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/infogain","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C510BAQHzCj5jr24FAg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630622441363/infogain_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=jf09L5g5b5zSK_wC3RTEXlCxLDydzyX-ENIbGDiAz-U","","","","","","","","","","",""
