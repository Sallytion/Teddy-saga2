 Turing is seeking experienced Rust developers to partner with a leading AI research lab in building safer, more reliable coding workflows. In this role, you’ll work on real\\-world Rust codebases to implement new features, debug ownership and concurrency issues, and design comprehensive tests that stress memory safety and correctness.
 



  





 This is a fully remote, highly flexible opportunity — work from anywhere, on your own schedule — while earning up to $100/hr. It’s a chance to apply your Rust expertise to frontier AI research, shaping how AI learns to generate and reason about systems\\-level code.
 



  





**What You’ll Do:** 



* Implement and refine features in production\\-grade Rust codebases.
* Diagnose, debug, and resolve ownership, borrowing, and concurrency challenges.
* Design comprehensive tests (unit, integration, property\\-based) to enforce safety.
