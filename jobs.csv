* Collaborate closely with propulsion engineers, safety personnel, and program managers to ensure testing aligns with technical and schedule objectives.
* Support integration and verification of test articles, fluid systems, and ground support equipment (GSE).
* Provide mentorship and technical guidance to junior test engineers and technicians.
* Maintain strict adherence to safety protocols—including use of PPE and SCBA as required for hazardous operations.
* Perform other test\\-related duties as assigned by management.


**Requirements**
**Required Qualifications**
* Bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or related field (Master’s degree preferred).
* 5\\+ years of hands\\-on experience in test engineering with a focus on hardware, propulsion, or mechanical systems.
* Proven track record conducting physical testing (hot\\-fire, high\\-pressure systems, or similar environments).
* Expertise in test stand operations, instrumentation setup, and DAQ tools (e.g., National Instruments, LabVIEW, MATLAB, etc.).
* Excellent problem\\-solving, critical thinking, and hands\\-on troubleshooting skills.
* Ability to work extended shifts, weekends, and non\\-standard hours as testing demands.
* Must be able to wear a self\\-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and operate safely in hazardous test environments.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Experience with hypergolic or cryogenic propulsion systems.
* Proficiency in test data reduction, visualization, and report generation.
* Familiarity with telemetry systems, control loops, or remote test execution tools.
* Prior experience leading test teams or managing test campaigns from planning to execution.
