+ Work with internal teams (Sales, Operations, Sourcing, Quality \\& Logistics) to ensure smooth project execution.
+ Engage with manufacturing partners to validate capabilities, pricing, and delivery timelines.

* Risk Identification \\& Mitigation
+ Detect potential manufacturing challenges early, reducing costly rework or delays.
+ Recommend alternative manufacturing processes, tolerances, or materials when required.

* Platform\\-driven Quoting Solutions
+ Leverage platform tools to automate portions of the quoting process for speed and accuracy.
