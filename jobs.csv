 At Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.
   

  

 We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!
   

  

**About The Role**
 A Security Operations Center (SOC) is typically something that a company will have to understand their systems' security risks and alert when any issues arise. We want to enable SOC teams to leverage Cloudflare data, logging, and events directly in Cloudflare's dashboard. This means we want to add new functionality to understand and react to any threats. This role is all about dealing with large amounts of data and helping customers understand it very quickly, as well as notifying customers about important happenings on that data.
   

  

 You will be working on systems that span multiple disciplines from databases to queues to search. We'll be not only processing data as it streams through but also allowing customers to search recent records, take actions inline, and document their entire process. As one of the founding engineers on the team you'll have a large influence on the architecture and will help decide the features and functionality of the product.
   

  

 Cloudflare is a system spanning the globe, on a mission to make the Internet better, safer, and more powerful every day. As a Software Engineer at Cloudflare, you’ll work on the code that runs close to the end user, runs at a massive scale, and is deployed to 330\\+ cities around the world.

* First and foremost curiosity and critical thinking
* 6\\+ years of experience
* Experience (and love for) debugging to ensure the system works in all cases
* Experience with a continuous integration workflow and using source control (we use git)
* Designing and building APIs
* Understanding of what it takes to build secure systems

* Strong systems level programming skills
* Optimization of complex solutions
* Experience with databases (we use PostgreSQL and Clickhouse)
* Understanding what it takes to build and maintain distributed systems
* Experience with monitoring, alerting and debugging high volume production systems

**What Makes Cloudflare Special?**
 We’re not just a highly ambitious, large\\-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large\\-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.
   

  

**Project Galileo** 
 : Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers\\-\\-at no cost.
   

  

**Athenian Project** 
 : In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.
   

  

**1\\.1\\.1\\.1** 
 : We released 1\\.1\\.1\\.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy\\-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use \\- it is the first consumer\\-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal \\- we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
