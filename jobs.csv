Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end\\-to\\-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk.

We do not want to just sprinkle AI on top of legacy software. We are rebuilding the core of real estate transaction, search, and financing using autonomous agents and intelligent data fabrics. We are looking for engineers who are tired of moving Jira tickets and want to ship shipping\\-grade intelligence.
 




  




**Is This You?** 

  






 You are a high\\-agency engineer who solves problems without waiting for permission. You understand that the modern AI stack moves weekly, not yearly. You do not just write code manually. You leverage tools like
 
**Cursor** 

 ,
 
**Claude Code** 

 , or
 
**OpenCode** 

 to amplify your output by 10x. You are obsessed with LLMs, not just as a consumer, but as an architect who understands how to ground them with RAG and integrate them via MCP.
 




**We do not care about your years of experience.** 

 We care about your git commit history, your ability to debug complex stochastic systems, and your hunger to build.
   





**The Stack \\& Tooling** 


 We work with the bleeding edge. You should be comfortable with:
 



* **AI\\-Native Workflows:** 

 diverse use of Cursor, GitHub Copilot Workspace, or Claude Code for rapid prototyping and development.
* **LLM Orchestration:** 

 LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or AutoGen.
* **Architecture:** 

 Advanced RAG (Hybrid Search, Re\\-ranking), Vector Databases (Qdrant/Pinecone/Milvus), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for connecting assistants to data.
* **Core ML:** 

 PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers.
* **Deployment:** 

 vLLM, TGI, Docker, Kubernetes, and serving quantized models.



  




**What You Will Actually Do** 
* **Build Autonomous Agents:** 

 Design and deploy agentic workflows that can navigate our internal APIs to automate property valuation, customer support, and lead qualification.
* **Engineer Context:** 

 Implement robust RAG pipelines that allow our models to ""read"" millions of legal documents and property records with zero hallucinations.
* **Ship Fast:** 

 Use AI\\-assisted coding tools to iterate on features in hours rather than days. You will take ownership of features from the whitespace on the whiteboard to the API endpoint in production.
* **Optimize \\& Fine\\-tune:** 

 specific SLMs (Small Language Models) for domain\\-specific tasks where latency and cost matter.
* **System Integration:** 

 specific implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize how our AI tools interface with our massive real estate datasets.



  




**Requirements (Proof of Work)** 
* **Demonstrable Projects:** 

 We need to see code. A GitHub link, a live demo, or a technical blog post explaining a complex problem you solved is mandatory.
* **AI Literacy:** 

 Deep understanding of how LLMs work under the hood. You know why a model hallucinates and you know how to fix it structurally.
* **Coding Velocity:** 

 Proficiency in Python is assumed. Proficiency in
 
*using AI to write Python* 

 is required.
* **Ownership Mindset:** 

 You act like a founder within the company. You spot broken processes and fix them.



  




**What We Offer** 
* **No Ceiling:** 

 We judge performance by impact. A junior engineer who ships a critical agent gets the same respect (and rewards) as a senior architect.
* **Access to Compute:** 

 We provide the infrastructure you need to train and deploy.
* **Real Data:** 

 You will not work on toy datasets. You will work with one of the most comprehensive real estate data lakes in India.



  




**How to Apply** 

**Do not just send a generic resume.** 



1. Send your CV.
2. **Crucially:** 

 Attach a link to your GitHub, a project portfolio, or a brief write\\-up of the most impressive thing you have built recently.
3. Bonus points if you tell us how you use tools like Cursor in your daily workflow.","Real Estate","https://in.linkedin.com/company/square-yards","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C510BAQE1Tfp7k18Lpw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630598736699/square_yards_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=xZJBbAJJ978mSB3sbwIOLoUyk2u7R5aPfhDJ0fiE7L8","","","","","","","","","","",""
