**About The Role:** 




 As a
 **Senior Software Engineer** 
 you’ll be a core part of our engineering team. You will bring your valuable experience and knowledge, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the team, along with the technical quality of our products. This is a key role in helping us become more mature, deliver innovative new products and unlock further business growth.
 



 This role will be part of a newly formed India\\-based team that will collaborate alongside our existing team based in Ireland. Following the successful delivery of some fantastic products, we are excited to accelerate this further in 2025 and beyond. You and your team will be tasked with delivering innovative new features and products that will directly help fuel Drive’s growth across Europe.
 



  





 Reporting to our Team Lead, you will be a core member of both the engineering and business teams. You’ll work across all our brands, helping to shape their future direction. Collaborating with our Product Owner, you will ensure requirements are well understood and can be delivered to a high standard. Working as part of a team, you will help shape the technical design of our platforms and solve complicated problems in elegant ways that are robust, scalable, and secure.
 



  





 This is a full\\-stack role and you will be directly contributing to delivering complicated functionality from our product roadmap. You will also have a keen eye over technical debt and drive improvements to the underlying quality and maintainability of our platforms. We don’t get everything right first time, but you will help us reflect, adjust and be better next time around.
 



  





 We are looking for people who are inquisitive, confident exploring unfamiliar problems, and have a passion for learning. We don’t have all the answers and don’t expect you to know everything either. Our team culture is open, inclusive, and collaborative – we tackle goals together. Seeking the best solution to a problem, we actively welcome ideas and opinions from everyone in the team.
 



  





**Our Technologies:** 




 We are continuously evolving our products and exploring new opportunities. We are focused on selecting the right technologies to solve the problem at hand. We know the technologies we’ll be using in 3 years’ time will probably be quite different to what we’re using today. You’ll be a key contributor to evolving our tech stack over time.
 



  





 We currently use a mix of React on the front\\-end, with JavaScript (Node.js) and Python on the backend. We use a variety of AWS services for our backend infrastructure and integrate specialist components from SaaS technology partners. We don’t need you to be an expert with these technologies, but it will help if you’re strong with something similar.
 



  





**Your Skills And Experience:** 




 This is an important role for us as we scale up the team and we are looking for someone who has existing experience at this level. You will have worked with customer\\-facing digital platforms that involve some kind of transaction, such as eCommerce, trading platforms or advertising lead generation.
 



  





 Your broad experience and knowledge of engineering methods means you’re able to build high quality products regardless of the language used – solutions that avoid common pitfalls impacting the platform’s technical performance. You can apply automated approaches for tracking and measuring quality throughout the whole lifecycle, through to the production environments.
 



  





 You are comfortable working with complex and varied problems. As a strong communicator, you work well with product owners and business stakeholders. You’re able to influence and persuade others by listening to their views, explaining your own thoughts, and working to achieve agreement.
 



  





 We have many automotive industry experts within our team already and they are eager to teach you everything you need to know for this role. Any existing industry knowledge is a bonus but is not necessary.
 



  





 This is a full\\-time role based in our India office on a semi\\-flexible basis. Our engineering team is globally distributed but we’d like you to be accessible to the office for ad\\-hoc meetings and workshops.
 



  





 Our Values
 



 Trust \\& Transparency \\| People First \\| Positive Experiences \\| Calm Persistence \\| Never Settling
