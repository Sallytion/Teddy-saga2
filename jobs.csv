Organizations still depend on oversized teams and aging tools to manually produce content, facilitate moderation, and pull actionable insights from fragmented user interactions. Even with AI technology widely available, deploying a simple automation typically requires weeks of effort, often resulting in pilots that never reach production. The consequences include lost revenue opportunities, exhausted personnel, and technology infrastructures unable to match the pace of contemporary commerce.
   

  

 IgniteTech is dismantling this paradigm. We replace human\\-intensive processes with adaptive, AI\\-driven systems capable of operating at 10x the traditional scale and velocity. Picture a marketing apparatus that generates and publishes material in response to live trend data, or a community infrastructure that aggregates, moderates, and distributes insights within seconds—all built, launched, and refined by a compact team of AI\\-fluent engineers working in 24\\-hour cycles. We don't stop at prototypes; we deliver functioning tools that immediately reshape operational workflows.
   

  

 This position is not suited for someone interested in managing Jira backlogs within conventional DevOps cycles. You will not receive a requirements document to implement. You will instead assume full ownership of intelligent systems designed to automate and advance our client operations. Your work will involve diagnosing friction points, designing AI\\-centric architectures, delivering MVPs in less than a day, and hardening them into robust production engines with measurable outcomes. If you seek a sandbox for GenAI experimentation, look elsewhere. If you intend to deploy GenAI as a strategic advantage, this is the right opportunity.
   

  

 You will become part of a compact, high\\-caliber team reconstructing the operational framework of entire business domains using AI as the foundation. You will engage directly with leadership, operate at speed, and evaluate success by tangible business results. If this aligns with your professional aspirations, submit your application today.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Design and deliver working AI prototypes within 24 hours that instantly automate genuine business processes
* Take complete ownership of AI solutions from conception through deployment and monitoring, operating autonomously without dependency on external approvals or support
* Propel ongoing automation efforts throughout the organization by surfacing new use cases and refining existing solutions to align with shifting business demands and technological advances


**Technical Lead Key Responsibilities**
* Construct an entirely redesigned, AI\\-enabled infrastructure that converts manual marketing workflows and community systems into intelligent platforms generating 10x operational value


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your default approach involves writing code manually before applying AI tools for validation or improvement, rather than leveraging AI from the outset, this role is not appropriate)
* A minimum of 5 years in full\\-stack software engineering (proficiency in both front\\-end and back\\-end development is mandatory)
* Hands\\-on experience embedding AI/LLMs (through API integration, prompt engineering, or workflow automation) into production applications
* Competence with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and constructing scalable, distributed architectures
* Knowledge of how to select appropriate LLM models for varying use cases and objectives
* Proven familiarity with and practical use of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
