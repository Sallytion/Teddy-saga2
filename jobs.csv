You collaborate well with teammates and contribute to projects that power intelligent, agent\\-driven search experiences at scale.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* You’ll work with a team of engineers and cross\\-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to define a product strategy and drive execution through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance.
* You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more.

 Adopt AI empowers modern applications to provide agentic experiences for end users within days. With Adopt, users can execute complex actions, automate workflows, and innovate via natural language commands. Our AI agents understand workflows and execute dynamic plans to achieve desired outcomes, enabling intuitive interaction with technology. Adopt AI helps companies build AI copilots and autonomous/semi\\-autonomous agents to stay relevant, adapt to changing needs, and retain high user satisfaction and engagement.
 



  





**About the Role** 




  





 This is a full\\-time on\\-site role for a Founding Engineer located in Bengaluru.
 



  





**Responsibilities** 




  




* Architect and build the core runtime that lets AI agents safely execute real workflows across SaaS tools and internal systems.
* Work side\\-by\\-side with the founders to define product direction, technical strategy, and what the company ultimately becomes.
* Turn messy real\\-world workflows into deterministic, reliable automation — retries, fallbacks, state handling, and correctness guarantees.
* Design event\\-driven and scheduled systems (triggers, background jobs, long\\-running workflows) that operate continuously in customer environments.
* Make agents debuggable and trustworthy: tracing, reproducibility, observability, and clear failure reasoning.
* Build and evolve integrations (APIs, auth, data models) so software becomes operable by AI, not humans.
* Own reliability end\\-to\\-end — performance, safety, cost efficiency, and scalability under production load.
* Talk to customers frequently, debug live issues, and convert edge cases into product capabilities.
* Reduce AI fragility: improve execution accuracy, remove prompt dependence, and harden the system toward deterministic behavior.
* Ship quickly across the stack (backend, infra, SDKs, tooling) and raise the engineering bar as the team grows.
* Establish engineering practices early — code quality, incident response, architecture decisions, and technical culture.
* Build product, not just systems — every line of code should move a real user workflow from manual → autonomous.



  





**Requirements** 




  




* 5\\+ years of strong backend/systems engineering experience at top technology companies or startups.
* Deep expertise in distributed systems, cloud\\-native architectures, and scalable system design.
* Practical experience building or deploying ML/GenAI applications (or closely working with ML/DS teams).
* Skilled in programming languages such as Python, Go, or TypeScript.
* Solid understanding of system observability, resiliency design, and SRE practices.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/getadoptai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQHoor2zup6kOw/company-logo_100_100/B4DZbESVBgHAAU-/0/1747049861656/getadoptai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=JNzmDcvGMDzzbGZXBRxvMQ1YzR3Y0MjDONtaDJXjfc8","","","","","","","","","","",""
