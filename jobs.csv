* Data Intuition: Understands ""garbage in, garbage out."" Can discuss the conceptual importance of data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation.
* Evaluation: Can explain the purpose of common metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision/recall, loss). Can look at a training/validation loss curve and identify clear overfitting or underfitting.


- Neural Networks (NNs)

- 

* Core Concepts: Can intuitively explain the basic components of a neural network (neurons, layers, weights, activation functions) and their purpose.
* Training Dynamics: Understands, at a high level, how a network ""learns"" via loss functions, gradient descent, and backpropagation.
* Practical Intuition: Can conceptually differentiate between training and inference and is familiar with core issues like overfitting and underfitting.


- Transformers
