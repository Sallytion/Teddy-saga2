 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea.

We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry\\-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi\\-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build and run applications anywhere—on premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 new developers signing up to use MongoDB every month, it’s no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next\\-generation, AI\\-powered applications.
   

  

 We have a fantastic opportunity for an experienced technical leader to join the MongoDB Technical Services team, leading the APAC Incident \\& Escalations Management Teams. This is a crucial leadership role that oversees the Asia Pacific teams that ensure our customers are able to successfully run MongoDB at scale and helps them navigate any “bumps in the road” they may encounter. This role relies on a technical leader who can operate both “hands\\-on,” taking ownership of high visibility escalations, often requiring whole\\-of\\-company response, while also building the teams and their processes, within a global critical situations management organization, to achieve strategic goals as MongoDB rapidly scales.
   

  

 We are looking to speak to candidates who are based in Bengaluru or Gurugram for our hybrid working model.
   

  

 Typical responsibilities of the team include:
   

  

* Managing critical, “seconds matter” production down incidents to rapid closure, ensuring customer confidence is retained and enhanced by a world class experience
* Overseeing post\\-incident root cause analyses, including ongoing continuous improvement in the broader Technical Services organization to reduce the likelihood of recurrence
* Collaborating with the global leadership team to define and execute strategies for the critical situations management function, while contributing to its evolution and development through continuous improvement.
* Collaborating with sales, professional services, customer success and other field teams on addressing issues which may be impeding expansion of product use within an account
* Partnering with managers and engineers within the organization to proactively prevent escalations by aligning the right resource to the right activity at the right time
* Collaborating with the product management and engineering teams to address issues which necessitate attention from those teams (including advocating for feature requests and accelerated defect resolution, where appropriate)
* Working cross\\-functionally to drive continuous improvement, ensuring that from an “outside in” perspective, customers experience MongoDB as a single unified team during an incident


 This is a role that requires technical competence with a tremendous amount of customer interface. Our customers are the best and brightest in the business and they have great expectations of our products and our company. If you are an experienced leader, the type of person who thrives in highly technical environments, enjoys helping customers, managing complex and fast\\-moving situations, and applying preparation and regular rehearsal to often complicated technical emergencies, this is the job for you.
   

  

 The Technical Services team is growing quickly. This leadership role will have a significant impact on the success of the global Incident \\& Escalations Management organization, helping to position our critical situations management capabilities for scale, efficiency and top\\-notch customer satisfaction.
