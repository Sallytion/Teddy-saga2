**Selected Intern's Day\\-to\\-day Responsibilites Include**
* Building the 'Lively Atmosphere': You will create the digital interface that guests use to control their stay. Instead of clicking buttons to 'turn on lights,' you will build smooth, fluid controls \\- like a 'mood slider' \\- that adjust the entire room’s lighting, sound, and temperature all at once.
* Creating 'Instant' Reality: You will use Next.js and specialized tools to ensure that when a guest interacts with the system, the physical change happens in less than 50 milliseconds. It should feel as natural and fast as flicking a physical light switch, even though complex code is running behind the scenes.
* Working on the 'Edge': Most apps send data to a cloud server far away. Your code will run on a powerful 'Edge Gateway' located right inside the studio. This ensures the room stays responsive.
* Killing Latency: You will spend your time making sure there is no lag. In our world, a one\\-second delay is a failure. You’ll be optimizing code to make sure the digital and physical worlds move as one.
* Invisible Design: You will focus on 'Invisible UI.' This means the technology should be so simple and well\\-integrated that the guest forgets it’s even there. You are designing for 'vibes' rather than 'features.'
* Privacy by Code: You will help build systems that automatically 'wipe' all guest data the moment they check out, ensuring total privacy through automated software routines rather than manual deletion.
