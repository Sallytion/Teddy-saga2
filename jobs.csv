 The anticipated compensation listed above and the value of core and optional employee benefits offered by Boston Scientific (BSC) – see www.bscbenefitsconnect.com\\-\\-will vary based on actual location of the position and other pertinent factors considered in determining actual compensation for the role. Compensation will be commensurate with demonstrable level of experience and training, pertinent education including licensure and certifications, among other relevant business or organizational needs.
 **At BSC, it is not typical for an individual to be hired near the bottom or top of the anticipated salary range listed above.**
 Compensation for
 **hourly, non\\-sales roles** 
 may also include variable compensation from time to time (e.g., any overtime and shift differential) and annual bonus target (subject to plan eligibility and other requirements).
   

  

 Compensation for
 **salaried, non\\-sales roles** 
 may also include variable compensation, i.e., annual bonus target and long\\-term incentives (subject to plan eligibility and other requirements).

 is governed by Sales Incentive Compensation Plan (which includes certain annual non\\-discretionary incentives based on predetermined objectives).
   

  

 Our organization is across Canada and has commercial representation in 140 countries.
   

  

 This job involves regular collaboration with colleagues, clients, and stakeholders across Canada, the U.S., and/or internationally, making proficiency in English essential for effective communication and alignment. English is necessary for engaging with a range of documentation and maintaining effective communication if interacting with external clients or vendors.
   

  

 As detailed in the job description, this job involves communicating, both verbally and in writing, with other Boston Scientific teams located across Canada, the United States and/or with our international clients and partners. International customers and partners represent an important part of our activities. Based on an evaluation, we have determined that the duties of Engineer III, Software Development (AI/ML Engineer \\- Medical Imaging) position require knowledge of English in addition to French (oral and written). We also determined that the English language skills already required of other employees do not permit the performance of English language skills tasks related to Engineer III, Software Development (AI/ML Engineer \\- Medical Imaging) position.
   

  

 However, in Québec, Boston Scientific limits as much as possible the number of positions for which it requires the knowledge of another language than French. Boston Scientific solely requires proficiency in English where it is necessary for the performance of an employee’s duties.","Medical Equipment Manufacturing","https://www.linkedin.com/company/boston-scientific","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQF3enIGxQaa7Q/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1688306370403?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=dAzpxzE-s2FWleZH-fOTK9m3i77k87T7MqMnrPV5T18","","","","","","","","","","",""
