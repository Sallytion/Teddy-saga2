 About Destro AI:
 





 Destro is building the global brain for robotics — a cloud\\-native orchestration and decision engine that controls fleets of autonomous robots across warehouses and factories. Think of us as the AI mothership that tells robots what to do, in real\\-time. Backed by top\\-tier venture investors, our team is building the next generation of operational intelligence that powers real\\-world automation at scale.
 




  





  






 Role Overview:
 





 We’re looking for a Founding Software Engineer who can take ownership of our fragmented codebases — and productionize, integrate, and harden it into a robust, scalable, enterprise\\-ready solution that can run in both cloud and on\\-prem environments. This is a mission\\-critical role where you’ll work directly with the founding team, own deployment architecture, and prepare the stack for live enterprise pilot launches.
 




  





  






 What You’ll Own:
 



* Refactor MVP codebases into a unified, modular platform
* Build backend APIs, scalable services, and data flows using Python (FastAPI)
* Own DevOps, CI/CD, and infrastructure for on\\-prem and cloud\\-native deployments
* Containerize everything (Docker, Kubernetes)
* Build secure auth, RBAC, and observability for production readiness
* Work directly with robotics engineers and Fortune 500 deployment teams
* Implement real\\-time data processing, MQTT/gRPC APIs, Redis streams, etc.



  





  





**Tech Stack (you should be fluent with most):** 



* Backend: Python (Fast API), Node.js
* Frontend: React, TypeScript
* DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
* Cloud: AWS (ECS, S3, Lambda, etc.), some GCP
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions or similar
* Infra: Linux, Postgres, MQTT, gRPC, Redis
* Bonus: Robotics/IoT deployments, RTLS integration, or wearable UX



  





  





**What We’re Looking For:** 



* Have 2 \\- 4 years of experience in full stack/backend/devops roles
* Have shipped real enterprise or infra products — bonus if in hybrid or on\\-prem setups
* Love cleaning up messy MVPs, refactoring systems, and writing scalable backend APIs
* Know how to write glue code across microservices and edge devices
* Be excited to work on AI for the physical world, not just cloud dashboards
* Care deeply about reliability, observability, and uptime
* Be able to move fast, own outcomes, and work independently



  





  





**Why Join Destro:** 



* Real\\-world AI \\+ Robotics
* Global Tech Exposure: Work with ex\\-Dexterity, ex\\-HAI Robotics, and NYU alumni, alongside top US retailers and 3PLs
* Equity \\+ Ownership: As a founding engineer, you’ll earn meaningful equity and have massive technical say
* Career\\-Defining Work: You’re building the brain that controls fleets of robots — from day one","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/destroaiautomation","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGr0sHAY80Yvw/company-logo_100_100/B4EZiZ45meGUAQ-/0/1754928487137/destroaiautomation_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=2V8Wey3n_Tl-ER9IMKEZD1xzUqNYCxQSnaqiNqi-sWM","","","","","","","","","","",""

 At
 **Vivid Automate** 
 , we solve real\\-world problems through smart, scalable AI and automation. From AI agents to full\\-stack no\\-code automations — we’re building the engine behind the scenes.
 



 We’re on the hunt for a curious and capable
 **Automation Engineer** 
 who loves making tools talk, setting up seamless workflows, and turning chaos into clean backend logic.
 



  





 What You’ll Be Doing
 



 This is a
 **freelance/full\\-time just\\-in\\-time setup role** 
 — perfect for an enthusiast or a systems thinker who enjoys lightweight yet high\\-leverage tasks.
 



  





 You'll:
 


* Build \\& maintain
 **AI agent workflows** 
 using tools like
 **OpenAI** 
 ,
 **Zapier** 
 ,
 **N8N** 
 ,
 **Make.com** 
 , etc.
* Integrate systems like
 **Notion, Airtable, Telegram, Slack, YouTube, Google Sheets, Discord** 
 , and more.
* Automate messaging flows (e.g.,
 **ManyChat** 
 ,
 **DM bots** 
 ,
 **Telegram flows** 
 ) for lead capture or community engagement.
* Use
 **APIs, webhooks** 
 , and creative scripting to streamline operations and eliminate bottlenecks.
* Set up AI\\-powered assistants, responders, or back\\-office tools that work quietly in the background.
* Deliver practical, working automation systems that
 **save time and increase value** 
 for both our internal team and our audience.



  





 You’ll Thrive in This Role If You:
 


* Have solid hands\\-on experience with
 **N8N, Make.com, Zapier** 
 , or similar workflow tools.
* Are
 **comfortable using APIs, webhooks** 
 , and building backend logic — even if it’s lightweight.
* Have
 **played with AI tools** 
 like
 **OpenAI API, ChatGPT, LangChain, or AutoGPT\\-style agents** 
 .
* Love solving
 **small but real business problems** 
 using smart tech instead of bloated stacks.
* Are
 **a curious problem solver** 
 who takes ownership and enjoys building quiet systems that just
 *work* 
 .
* Can
 **showcase past work** 
 or side projects — or at least a strong motivation to learn quickly.



  





 What This Role Is (and Isn’t):
 



 ✅ Lightweight but meaningful — mostly one\\-off builds with potential for deeper systems if it clicks.
 



 ✅ Remote, async\\-friendly, and problem\\-focused.
 



 ✅ A good opportunity if you're building a career in
 **AI operations, automation engineering, or AI product support** 
 .
 



  





 ❌ This is
 *not* 
 a heavy frontend or design role.
 



 ❌ This is
 *not* 
 a passive role — we’re looking for
 **builders** 
 , not just tool users.
 



  





 Bonus Points:
 


* You’ve integrated
 **ChatGPT with external toolsYou’ve bu
 * ilt bots for Slack/Telegram/DiscordYou can e

* xplain technical ideas clearly in simple languageYou’ve au

* tomated your own systems or client workflows

 *you’re either already skilled or an eager self\\-starter*
