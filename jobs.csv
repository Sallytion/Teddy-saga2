**The Opportunity :**
 At Illumine, we are pioneering next\\-generation technologies called
 **Adaptive Knowledge Systems** 
 \\- a new class of intelligent systems that go far beyond traditional learning platforms. These systems are designed to transform mindsets, enable discovery, and capture collective knowledge \\& intelligence at scale.
   

  

 Some examples of adaptive knowledge systems that we are building include :
   

  

* Transformational learning at scale i.e., learning focused on building values, reshaping attitudes/ mindsets, building thinking capacities, etc. at scale
* Collective Intelligence focused on collaborative problem\\-solving
* Counseling Tools/ Business toolboxes (custom builds for unique business challenges for clients e.g. trust\\-based customer engagement)


 Unlike conventional educational tools like MOOCs or SCORM\\-based systems, our work sits at the intersection of AI, Knowledge, and Business. These platforms use a combination of \\- AI\\-driven knowledge capture, Learning pedagogies, AI\\-driven collaboration models, collective problem\\-solving frameworks and many more.
   

  

 Our mission is to improve the quality of thinking and working in organizations and individuals to unlock new possibilities and prepare themselves for a BANI world.
   

  

 Join the
 **Knowledge Technology Team** 
 to be part of the mission and leverage (a) nearly 30 years of Illumines original research, innovation, and knowledge and (b) the core platform technologies \\& apps that have been tested \\& deployed to more than 1 million working professionals across industries and sectors (in the last 3 years alone).
   

  

**The Role**
 As a Next\\-Gen Technology Builder, you will
   

  

* Build, test, and deploy features using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with a team of developers.
* Work on scaling and bringing engineering rigor for robust deployment (beta build mode)
* Solve complex, open\\-ended problems that require both creativity and engineering discipline
* Conceptualize and rapid prototype new ideas (alpha build mode)
* Collaborate with product managers, designers, and domain experts to translate ideas into working systems
* Experiment with AI tools, low\\-code/no\\-code platforms, and emerging technologies to accelerate builds


**Will you enjoy this work?**
**Yes, If You**
* Love complex, challenging problems and can hold ambiguity without losing momentum.
* Are excited by AI, knowledge systems, and the future of learning and work.
* Enjoy switching between conceptual thinking and hands\\-on building.
* Have a builder mindset you like to prototype, test, and iterate.
* Can work in a fast\\-evolving, experimental environment where clarity emerges as you build.
* Value impact over routine and want to build something transformative.

 Blitz powers India’s fastest e\\-commerce deliveries, enabling
 **60\\-minute and same\\-day fulfillment** 
 for brands like Decathlon, Adidas, Puma, and Purplle. Our systems use
 **AI\\-driven logistics, real\\-time decisioning, and high\\-scale distributed architecture** 
 to deliver 98%\\+ success and 50% lower RTOs.
   

  

 We’re hiring a
 **Senior Engineering Lead** 
 who focuses on solving problems, driving outcomes, and measuring impact. This is a hands\\-on leadership role for someone who owns delivery end\\-to\\-end, leads critical systems, and raises engineering excellence across teams.
   

  

**Role Overview**
 As a Senior Engineering Lead, you will:
   

  

* Lead multiple engineering initiatives from conception to measurable impact.
* Act as a hands\\-on IC for critical systems — design, code, review, and debug.
* Solve real business and operational problems, not just deliver requirements.
* Define success metrics for every project and validate solutions through data and monitoring.
* Improve reliability, observability, and performance across the tech stack.
* Influence engineers through technical depth, clarity, and high execution standards.


**Key Responsibilities**
**Outcome\\-Driven Engineering**

* Maintain a high\\-velocity, low\\-defect release culture.


**Mentorship \\& Influence**
* Mentor engineers on system design, debugging, and problem\\-solving.
* Set and enforce engineering standards for quality, clarity, and measurable impact.
* Lead by example — influencing through capability, not hierarchy.


**Required Qualifications**
**Technical Expertise**
* 8–10 years of backend/full\\-stack engineering experience, with leadership responsibilities.
* Strong command of Java (Spring Boot), Python (Django/FastAPI), or Golang.
* Deep understanding of microservices, CQRS, DDD, and event\\-driven architecture.

**Leadership Experience**
* Led multiple engineering projects to measurable outcomes.
* Strong ability to identify risks early and design preventive systems.
* Experience mentoring engineers and raising technical standards.
* Able to balance hands\\-on execution with architecture and planning.


**Mindset \\& Culture Fit**
* Outcome\\-first, not output\\-first.
* Thinks in metrics and root causes, not assumptions.
* Ownership\\-driven — uptime, reliability, and system health matter personally.
* Thrives in fast\\-paced, high\\-accountability environments.


**Bonus Skills**
* Experience with AI\\-assisted development or AI agents.
* Background in logistics, supply chain, fintech, or high\\-scale transactional platforms.
* Expertise in performance engineering or incident management.
