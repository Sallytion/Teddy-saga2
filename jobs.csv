 To facilitate this, LinkedIn has established a centralized experimentation platform used by all engineering teams to launch new services or product features with an experimentation flag. This platform allows them to set up experiments, scale them safely, observe results, and gain insights into statistical significance and metric impact. The stability, reliability, and observability of these platforms are paramount. Continuous evolution of our tech stack is essential to support the scale of thousands of experiments. Additionally, as we integrate more AI/ML workloads, our experimentation platform must evolve to meet these new demands. Our goal is to transition from a manual design, execution, and reporting process to a fully automated, AI\\-assisted experience, to drive increase in experimentation velocity.
