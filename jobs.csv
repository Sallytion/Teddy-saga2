**About The Role**
 We’re looking for an AI Engineer who can design, implement, and productionize LLM\\-powered agents that solve real\\-world enterprise problems—think automated research assistants, data\\-driven copilots, and workflow optimizers. You’ll own projects end\\-to\\-end: scoping, prototyping, evaluating, and deploying scalable agent pipelines that integrate seamlessly with our customers’ ecosystems.
   

  

 What you'll do:
   

  

 Architect \\& build multi\\-agent systems using frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen, Google ADK, Palantir Foundry, or custom orchestration layers.
   

  

 Fine\\-tune and prompt\\-engineer LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, open\\-source) for retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG), reasoning, and tool use.
   

  

 Integrate agents with enterprise data sources (APIs, SQL/NoSQL DBs, vector stores like Pinecone, Elasticsearch) and downstream applications (Snowflake, ServiceNow, custom APIs).
   

  

 Own the MLOps lifecycle: containerize (Docker), automate CI/CD, monitor drift \\& hallucinations, set up guardrails, observability, and rollback strategies.
   

  

 Collaborate cross\\-functionally with product, UX, and customer teams to translate requirements into robust agent capabilities and user\\-facing features.
   

  

 Benchmark \\& iterate on latency, cost, and accuracy; design experiments, run A/B tests, and present findings to stakeholders.
   

  

 Stay current with the rapidly evolving GenAI landscape and champion best practices in ethical AI, data privacy, and security.
   

  

 Must\\-Have Technical Skills
   

  

 3–5 years software engineering or ML experience in production environments.
   

  

 Strong Python skills (async I/O, typing, testing) plus familiarity with TypeScript/Node or Go a bonus.
   

  

 Hands\\-on with at least one LLM/agent frameworks and platforms (LangChain, LangGraph, Google ADK, LlamaIndex, Emma, etc.).
   

  

 Solid grasp of vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS) and embedding models.
   

  

 Experience building and securing REST/GraphQL APIs and microservices.
   

  

 Cloud skills on AWS, Azure, or GCP (serverless, IAM, networking, cost optimization).
   

  

 Proficient with Git, Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar).
   

  

 Knowledge of ML Ops tooling (Kubeflow, MLflow, SageMaker, Vertex AI) or equivalent custom pipelines.
   

  

 Core Soft Skills
   

  

 Product mindset: translate ambiguous requirements into clear deliverables and user value.
   

  

 Communication: explain complex AI concepts to both engineers and executives; write crisp documentation.
   

  

 Collaboration \\& ownership: thrive in cross\\-disciplinary teams, proactively unblock yourself and others.
   

  

 Bias for action: experiment quickly, measure, iterate—without sacrificing quality or security.
   

  

 Growth attitude: stay curious, seek feedback, mentor juniors, and adapt to the fast\\-moving GenAI space.
   

  

 Nice\\-to\\-Haves
   

  

 Experience with RAG pipelines over enterprise knowledge bases (SharePoint, Confluence, Snowflake).
   

  

 Hands\\-on with MCP servers/clients, MCP Toolbox for Databases, or similar gateway patterns.
   

  

 Familiarity with LLM evaluation frameworks (LangSmith, TruLens, Ragas).
   

  

 Familiarity with Palantir/Foundry.

 Prior work on conversational UX, prompt marketplaces, or agent simulators.
   

  

 Contributions to open\\-source AI projects or published research.
   

  

 Why Join Us?
