**RLHF in one line** 




 Generate code ➜ expert engineers rank, edit, and justify ➜ convert that feedback into reward signals ➜ reinforcement learning tunes the model toward code you’d actually ship.
 



 What You’ll Need
 


* **3\\+ years of professional software engineering experience** 
 in
 **Python**
* (Constraint programming experience is a bonus, but not required)
* **Strong code\\-review instincts** 
 —you can spot logic errors, performance traps, and security issues quickly.
* **Extreme attention to detail and excellent written communication skills.**
* Much of this role involves explaining
 *why* 
 one approach is better than another. This cannot be overstated.
* You
 **enjoy reading documentation and language specs** 
 and thrive in an asynchronous, low\\-oversight environment.



  





**What You Don’t Need** 



* No prior RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) or AI training experience.
* No deep machine learning knowledge. If you can review and critique code clearly, we’ll teach you the rest.



  





**Tech Stack** 




 We are looking for engineers with a strong command of
 **Python** 
 .
 



  





**Logistics** 



* **Location:** 
 Fully remote — work from anywhere
* **Compensation:** 
 From $30/hr to $70/hr, depending on location and seniority
