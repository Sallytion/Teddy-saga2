 Miimansa is developing technology that will accelerate the development of medical interventions as well as patient care–— a unified suite that turns raw, unstructured clinical data into structured, standardized, and privacy\\-preserved intelligence.
 



  





 At the core we bring together deep expertise in clinical data\\-management workflows, life sciences research and AI to address some of the major bottlenecks in experimental medicine. 
 



  





 Through continuous innovation and a strong network of partnerships with healthcare and clinical research leaders, we have achieved demonstrable success in crucial health data management tasks. For instance, we are at the bleeding edge in automatic data de\\-identification, extraction of complex clinical entities and mapping to global standards such as SNOMED CT, RxNorm, and FHIR. The next stage of our journey is to achieve architectural readiness that allows these solutions to scale securely, evolve rapidly, and efficiently operationalize the newest advances in AI.
 



  





**The Role** 




  





 We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer who will play a pivotal role in componentizing our AI pipeline and leading its transition to the cloud. This is both a hands\\-on engineering challenge and a strategic systems\\-design role: you’ll architect component boundaries, refactor legacy modules, implement CI/CD pipelines, and champion engineering excellence across the team.
 



 You’ll work directly with the tech leadership and cross\\-functional leads to achieve the readiness for scale — helping power the next generation of responsible, interoperable AI for healthcare. This is a foundational role with significant scope for ownership, influence, and leadership growth.

* Refactor existing Python\\-based code into independent, testable services with well\\-defined APIs.
* Build and manage CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or similar tools.
* Develop cloud\\-native infrastructure with an infrastructure as code stack (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus/Grafana).
* Collaborate with data scientists and AI engineers to containerize and integrate LLM\\- and NLP\\-driven components.
* Drive best practices in code review, documentation, and automated testing.
* Mentor engineers and uphold a culture of quality, reliability, and innovation.



  





**Qualifications** 



* 5\\-10 years of hands\\-on software engineering experience.
* Strong in Python; experience with TypeScript/React a plus.
* Proven experience designing or refactoring modular or microservice architectures.
* Deep familiarity with AWS / GCP / Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
* Solid understanding of testing frameworks, API design, and data pipeline orchestration (Airflow/Prefect).
* Exposure to AI/ML systems (especially NLP or LLM applications) preferred.
* Awareness of health data standards (FHIR, OMOP, SNOMED, RxNorm) and privacy regulations (HIPAA, DPDP Act) is a strong bonus.



  





**Who You Are** 



* A systems thinker who designs for evolution and scale.
* A hands\\-on builder who thrives in refactoring, debugging, and iterating.
* A collaborative leader who can guide the team and elevate code quality.
* A curious technologist tracking the latest in AI infrastructure and large\\-language\\-model tooling.
* Motivated to grow into a Platform Architect / Head of Engineering role as Miimansa’s product ecosystem expands.



  





**﻿
 
 Why Join Miimansa AI** 



* Be part of a core engineering team shaping the backbone of ethical AI in healthcare.
* Work at the intersection of AI, cloud architecture, and clinical data privacy.
