 Established in 2022 in Kothrud, Pune, Micromation Systems is a partnership\\-based firm manufacturing CNC machines, PID controllers, pH controllers, and more. We also create custom\\-made fully automated machines for various job types. Our products are known for their premium quality, seamless finish, unique patterns, and affordable prices. With a commitment to timely delivery, we have gained a significant client base in the market.
 



**Role Description This** 
 is a full\\-time, on\\-site role for an Automation Software Trainee. The primary focus of this role will be the development of a PC\\-based Human\\-Machine Interface (HMI) for our next\\-generation motion control systems and assisting in the testing and validation of the entire system.
 



 The trainee will work directly with our lead embedded systems engineer. While the core embedded firmware will be provided, you will be responsible for creating the powerful C\\+\\+ desktop application that communicates with it. This is a critical role that bridges the gap between the machine and the operator.
 



**Day\\-to\\-day responsibilities will include:** 



* Designing and developing a high\\-performance HMI application from the ground up using
 **C\\+\\+** 
 and the
 **Qt framework** 
 .
* Implementing a
 **TCP/IP Ethernet communication** 
 protocol to send real\\-time commands and receive status data from our STM32\\-based embedded controller.
* Creating a live
 **2D visualization module** 
 within the HMI to plot the machine's toolpath and provide real\\-time feedback to the operator.
* Developing and executing comprehensive test plans to validate the communication link and the accuracy of the motion control system.
* Troubleshooting and debugging issues at the system level, involving both the PC application and its interaction with the embedded device.
* Documenting the software architecture and testing procedures.


**Qualifications** 

 We are looking for a candidate with a foundational knowledge of software development and a keen interest in automation and robotics. You will be testing and validating the embedded code developed by our senior engineer.

 , with a methodical approach to debugging.
* Effective communication skills, with the ability to collaborate closely with the embedded engineering team.
* Ability to work independently on well\\-defined tasks and manage your time effectively.
* Relevant educational background in Computer Science, Information Technology, Electronics, or a related engineering field.


**Preferred Skills (Nice to Have)** 
* Prior experience with a GUI framework, especially
 **Qt** 
 .
* Basic understanding of
 **TCP/IP networking** 
 concepts (sockets, clients, servers).
* Experience with 2D graphics, plotting, or any form of data visualization.
* Familiarity with reading and understanding embedded C code for testing purposes.



**What We Offer:** 



* **Direct Mentorship:** 
 You will work one\\-on\\-one with our lead engineer, gaining direct mentorship and insights that are rare in larger companies. This is a unique opportunity to learn from an experienced professional in the field.
* **High\\-Impact Project Ownership:** 
 This is not a typical internship where you'll be given minor tasks. You will be the primary developer for a critical component of our product—the HMI. Your work will directly influence the final product and you'll have a significant, tangible project for your portfolio.
* **End\\-to\\-End Experience:** 
 You will see a real\\-world project through from the design phase, to development, testing, and final integration. This complete lifecycle experience is incredibly valuable for your future career.
* **Flexibility:** 
 As a startup, we can offer flexible working hours from home to accommodate your academic schedule.
* **Internship Credit \\& Stipend:**

 Proficient with Git, Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar).
   

  

 Knowledge of ML Ops tooling (Kubeflow, MLflow, SageMaker, Vertex AI) or equivalent custom pipelines.

 Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.
   

  

 Since 2012, we have built the market\\-leading cloud security company and an award\\-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Paris, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive. Visit us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter@Netskope.

If you are passionate about solving complex problems and developing cloud services that are reliable, performant and scalable, we would like to speak with you.
