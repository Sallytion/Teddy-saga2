**Who We Are**
 We are deeply connected with the idea that live sports events are fundamentally different: there is only one shot at delivering the moment until it is forever lost. Our mission is to make sure that our customers never miss a single moment of the sports they love. To do this we need to deliver best\\-in\\-class live sports infrastructure, testing, monitoring, and operations to optimize the delivery of live sports experiences at scale. Our team engineers for speed, quality, availability, and scale. As Prime Video has grown, we've increased the depth and breadth of video products we support, with a corresponding increase in the associated size and complexity of our engineering activity and the load on our services. Our goal is to adapt our architecture to maintain and improve our velocity of delivery for customers in the face of these changes, and for our services to be on and error\\-free 24/7, especially for high\\-profile, exclusive content. With AI as a transformative force, we're at an inflection point that enables us to unlock new opportunities in predictive analytics, automated defect analysis and mitigation, and automated operations that were previously beyond our reach.

If you are the one that’s excited about entrepreneurial thinking, creating technology solutions for complex problems we want to hear from you.
   

  

**What You Will Do Here**
 You will work with groups such as Product Management, UX designers to understand customer usage models and develop test plans and suites that approximate real\\-world environments and regression tests driving the software development process toward quality\\-centric methodologies. You will also work with Software Development Engineers to understand features and technical implementation. In this role, you will be responsible to deliver manual/automated solutions to test customer facing features. You will be empowered to choose the right highly scalable and available technology to solve complex problems in software quality assurance.
   

  

**What You Will Get From Us**
 A great team to work with and the chance to build at a proven top tier company. You will get a startup like culture with the stability of an established industry leader. You will get support and resources from some of the smartest people in the industry to continue learning.
