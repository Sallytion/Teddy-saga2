**About Talia Healthcare**
 Talia Healthcare is modernizing how healthcare operations run. We help physician groups, clinics, and digital health companies automate front\\- and back\\-office workflows—prescription refills, insurance checks, scheduling, intake, and more—so care teams can spend more time with patients instead of paperwork.
   

  

 In just weeks, we''''ve secured multiple pilot customers and have growing demand from multi\\-site clinic groups. We''''re now entering the next phase: building the technical and compliance foundation to scale safely and sustainably.
   

  

 Talia is bootstrapped, profitable at the customer level, and led by a technical founder (ex\\-AWS/Databricks) with a track record of building multiple companies.
   

  

 Role Overview
   

  

 We are hiring a Workflow Automation \\& Integrations Engineer to be the technical backbone of our platform.
   

  

 This is a key role where you''''ll work directly with the founder to take early workflows and turn them into secure, production\\-grade, HIPAA\\-compliant, automated systems. You will build healthcare integrations, set up automation infrastructure, own the AWS stack, and ensure our workflows operate reliably at scale.
   

  

 You don''''t need to be a CTO\\-level engineer—but you must be strong at AWS, basic backend thinking, integrations, and building clean workflows. The founder is technical and can guide architecture; you will handle hands\\-on implementation and scaling.
   

  

 What You''''ll Do
   

  

 Own automation infrastructure:
   

  

* Deploy and manage workflow orchestration tools (e.g., n8n) in a secure, self\\-hosted AWS environment (EC2, ECS, etc.).
* Build HIPAA\\-compliant systems: Implement access controls, audit logs, secure data flows, encryption, error handling, and guardrails for automation logic.
* Develop healthcare integrations: Connect with EHRs like AthenaHealth, Healthie, Practice Fusion, and other healthcare APIs and third\\-party platforms.


 Create scalable automated workflows:
   

  

* Convert complex clinic operations into automated processes that run reliably with monitoring, retries, logging, and version control.


 Monitor, maintain \\& harden systems:
   

  

* Set up CloudWatch dashboards, alerts, error\\-handling systems, and internal monitoring tools.


 Contribute to compliance readiness:
   

  

* Assist in preparing for SOC 2 and HIPAA audits by documenting systems, building required controls, and working with external compliance partners.


 Work directly with the founder and clinics:
   

  

* Understand operational workflows, translate requirements into workflows, and own implementation end\\-to\\-end.


 What We''''re Looking For
   

  

 Must\\-haves:
   

  

* 2–3\\+ years of software engineering experience
* Hands\\-on strong experience with AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, RDS)
* Experience with workflow automation tools (ideally n8n, but Zapier/Temporal/Airflow okay conceptually)
* Experience integrating APIs (REST, webhooks, auth flows)
* HIPAA Certification (Mandatory): Candidate must have completed a recognized HIPAA training/certification program and hold a current certificate of completion.
* Strong communication skills and comfort working directly with the founder
* Self\\-starter mindset; comfortable with 0→1 building and rapid iteration
* High ownership mindset—can take specs, ask clarifying questions, and execute end\\-to\\-end


 Nice\\-to\\-haves:
   

  

* Prior experience in healthcare or with EHR integrations (Athena, Healthie, Practice Fusion)
* Experience with self\\-hosting services in secure environments
* Understanding of audit logging, PHI handling, and secure data pipelines
* Experience with workflow scheduling, error handling, retries, versioning


 Why Join Talia Healthcare
   

  

* High\\-ownership role in a fast\\-growing, revenue\\-generating healthtech startup
* Direct mentorship and collaboration with a deeply technical founder (ex\\-AWS/Databricks)
* Your work directly improves real patient care by saving clinicians hours every day
* Bootstrapped \\+ stable — we grow sustainably, backed by paying customers
* Technical culture — decisions are fast, rational, and practical
* No bureaucracy — build, ship, and see your work live in real clinics
* Opportunity to grow into Lead Engineer or long\\-term Architect as we scale

**About Talia Healthcare**
 Talia Healthcare is modernizing how healthcare operations run. We help physician groups, clinics, and digital health companies automate front\\- and back\\-office workflows—prescription refills, insurance checks, scheduling, intake, and more—so care teams can spend more time with patients instead of paperwork.
   

  

 In just weeks, we''''ve secured multiple pilot customers and have growing demand from multi\\-site clinic groups. We''''re now entering the next phase: building the technical and compliance foundation to scale safely and sustainably.
   

  

 Talia is bootstrapped, profitable at the customer level, and led by a technical founder (ex\\-AWS/Databricks) with a track record of building multiple companies.
   

  

 Role Overview
   

  

 We are hiring a Workflow Automation \\& Integrations Engineer to be the technical backbone of our platform.
   

  

 This is a key role where you''''ll work directly with the founder to take early workflows and turn them into secure, production\\-grade, HIPAA\\-compliant, automated systems. You will build healthcare integrations, set up automation infrastructure, own the AWS stack, and ensure our workflows operate reliably at scale.
   

  

 You don''''t need to be a CTO\\-level engineer—but you must be strong at AWS, basic backend thinking, integrations, and building clean workflows. The founder is technical and can guide architecture; you will handle hands\\-on implementation and scaling.
   

  

 What You''''ll Do
   

  

 Own automation infrastructure:
   

  

* Deploy and manage workflow orchestration tools (e.g., n8n) in a secure, self\\-hosted AWS environment (EC2, ECS, etc.).
* Build HIPAA\\-compliant systems: Implement access controls, audit logs, secure data flows, encryption, error handling, and guardrails for automation logic.
* Develop healthcare integrations: Connect with EHRs like AthenaHealth, Healthie, Practice Fusion, and other healthcare APIs and third\\-party platforms.


 Create scalable automated workflows:
   

  

* Convert complex clinic operations into automated processes that run reliably with monitoring, retries, logging, and version control.


 Monitor, maintain \\& harden systems:
   

  

* Set up CloudWatch dashboards, alerts, error\\-handling systems, and internal monitoring tools.


 Contribute to compliance readiness:
   

  

* Assist in preparing for SOC 2 and HIPAA audits by documenting systems, building required controls, and working with external compliance partners.


 Work directly with the founder and clinics:
   

  

* Understand operational workflows, translate requirements into workflows, and own implementation end\\-to\\-end.


 What We''''re Looking For
   

  

 Must\\-haves:
   

  

* 2–3\\+ years of software engineering experience
* Hands\\-on strong experience with AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, RDS)
* Experience with workflow automation tools (ideally n8n, but Zapier/Temporal/Airflow okay conceptually)
* Experience integrating APIs (REST, webhooks, auth flows)
* HIPAA Certification (Mandatory): Candidate must have completed a recognized HIPAA training/certification program and hold a current certificate of completion.
* Strong communication skills and comfort working directly with the founder
* Self\\-starter mindset; comfortable with 0→1 building and rapid iteration
* High ownership mindset—can take specs, ask clarifying questions, and execute end\\-to\\-end


 Nice\\-to\\-haves:
   

  

* Prior experience in healthcare or with EHR integrations (Athena, Healthie, Practice Fusion)
* Experience with self\\-hosting services in secure environments
* Understanding of audit logging, PHI handling, and secure data pipelines
* Experience with workflow scheduling, error handling, retries, versioning


 Why Join Talia Healthcare
   

  

* High\\-ownership role in a fast\\-growing, revenue\\-generating healthtech startup
* Direct mentorship and collaboration with a deeply technical founder (ex\\-AWS/Databricks)
* Your work directly improves real patient care by saving clinicians hours every day
* Bootstrapped \\+ stable — we grow sustainably, backed by paying customers
* Technical culture — decisions are fast, rational, and practical
* No bureaucracy — build, ship, and see your work live in real clinics
* Opportunity to grow into Lead Engineer or long\\-term Architect as we scale
