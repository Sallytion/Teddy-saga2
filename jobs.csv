You’ll work across platform, backend, and ML teams to ensure our infrastructure is reliable, developer\\-friendly, and future\\-proof.

**What You’ll Do**
 Build and extend Kubernetes operators/controllers to automate system and application lifecycles.
   

  

 Develop internal platform tools to simplify deployments, observability, and scaling.
   

  

 Implement Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi, or Crossplane) for reproducible environments.
   

  

 Drive GitOps adoption using tools like ArgoCD or Flux.
   

  

 Design and optimize CI/CD pipelines for microservices and data\\-intensive workloads.
   

  

 Partner with backend and ML engineers to architect scalable, cloud\\-native systems.
   

  

 Monitor, secure, and continuously improve cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
   

  

**What We’re Looking For**
 2–6 years of experience in Platform Engineering, DevOps, or Cloud\\-Native Backend.
   

  

 Deep understanding of Kubernetes internals; experience writing custom operators/controllers.
   

  

**Hands\\-on Coding Experience In Go (preferred) Or Python.**
 Strong knowledge of IaC frameworks (Terraform, Pulumi, Crossplane).
   

  

 Experience with GitOps workflows and tools (ArgoCD, Flux).
   

  

 Background in CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.).
   

  

 Familiarity with at least one major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure).
   

  

 Bonus: exposure to observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, ELK).
   

  

**Why You’ll Love Working Here**
**Engineering\\-first culture** 
 : Write real software, not just scripts.
   

  

**High impact** 
 : Your work directly enables developer velocity and product scalability.
   

  

**Cutting\\-edge stack** 
 : Kubernetes, IaC, GitOps, and modern CI/CD at scale.
   

  

**Ownership \\& growth** 
 : Autonomy to shape the platform and fast\\-track your career.
   

  

**Competitive rewards** 
 : Strong compensation package and opportunities to grow with the company.
