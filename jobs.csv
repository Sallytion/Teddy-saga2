 Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third\\-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.
   

  

 Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1\\.8B\\+ from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.

 This industry might seem boring,but it’s a $70B backbone of the economy that’s breaking under a talent shortage no one has solved. We’re fixing it. Fast.
   

  

 In just 9 months, we’ve hit strong product\\-market fit, are generating insanely fast\\-growing, ridiculously sticky revenue, and are backed by top\\-tier investors. We’re not a tool—we’re the missing workforce firms have been sounding the alarm for.

 ⸻
   

  

**What We Should Tell You About The Role**
 This role sits at the heart of how we turn complex, human tax reasoning into scalable intelligence. You’ll be building the brain of the first AI tax preparer trusted by America’s accounting firms. Your work will touch everything from retrieval pipelines to model evaluation to how our system thinks about a single user query. This is not a narrow research role—it’s applied, fast\\-moving, and deeply interdisciplinary. You’ll partner with product, engineering, and domain experts to ship features that real firms rely on daily, balancing cutting\\-edge AI with the rigor and reliability that compliance demands.
   

  

**Here’s why this is a terrible job**
 This isn’t for someone who likes to move slow. We operate week to week with ruthless speed. Sometimes we’re wrong, but more often we’re right—and we course\\-correct fast. If you need extra days to perfect your model, teammates will be waiting on you. We use tools like Cursor, OpenAI, and Gemini to prototype fast, test in prod, and push to users in hours, not quarters. You’ll work at the intersection of LLMs, user behavior, compliance, and knowledge graphs, with no clean datasets or perfect answers—just judgment calls and chaos. You’ll ask yourself,
 *is this really the work?* 
 It is. And it’s not for everyone.
   

  

* and here’s why it’s the best career choice you’ll make


 We’re hyperscaling, well\\-funded, and hit strong product\\-market fit in nine months. We’re building what tax pros call impossible, a product that behaves like a teammate, not a tool. We run reviews every four months, operate with full transparency, and pay above market with fast\\-growing equity. You’ll own decisions, ship because you believe in what you build, and talk to users weekly. We’ll set the goal; how you get there;prompting, tuning, retrieval, structured data—is up to you. You’ll help build a customer oracle so sharp it predicts what users need before they do.
   

  

**What You’ll Be Responsible For**
 You’ll design and implement LLM\\-powered workflows across tax, finance, and compliance, building agentic frameworks with tools like adk, LangChain, and CrewAI. You’ll develop scalable knowledge systems for memory, retrieval, and reasoning, and own prompt pipelines, vector stores, fine\\-tuned models, and evals. You’ll think in systems, probabilities, and second\\-order effects as you work across ambiguous problem spaces that blend LLMs, APIs, and semi\\-structured data. You’ll become an internal Oracle, building a deep mental model of our users so precise it can predict what they need before they ask.
   

  

**The teammate we’re looking for**
 You thrive on complexity and get energized by the edge cases most people avoid. You’re pragmatic—fast to ship, faster to learn—and you believe research only matters when it drives outcomes. You’re fluent in tools like OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude, comfortable writing production\\-grade Python, and confident working across cloud environments like GCP or Azure. You grasp embeddings, RAG, and retrieval at scale, and may have built internal tooling for model debugging or evals. You collaborate deeply across product, engineering, and operations, stay curious about everything you automate, and take full ownership of outcomes. You love seeing your work in front of real users daily—and improving it just as quickly.
   

  

**Growth And Levels**
* We operate on six levels, from Level 1 to Level 6\\. Each reflects increasing ownership, impact, and scope with meaningful jumps in salary and equity.
* We review levels every 4 months. Promotions are based on output and ownership, not tenure.
* This isn’t a comfy lean\\-back role. It’s fast, focused, and customer\\-obsessed.
* You will launch fast. You will learn fast. You will own what you ship.


**Equal Opportunity**
 Filed is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every single qualification, we encourage you to apply anyway as we’re building a team of people with diverse strengths, experiences, and backgrounds.
