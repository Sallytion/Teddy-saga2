 As part of the AWS Solutions organization, we have a vision to provide business applications, leveraging Amazon’s unique experience and expertise, that are used by millions of companies worldwide to manage day\\-to\\-day operations. We will accomplish this by accelerating our customers’ businesses through delivery of intuitive and differentiated technology solutions that solve enduring business challenges. We blend vision with curiosity and Amazon’s real\\-world experience to build opinionated, turnkey solutions. Where customers prefer to buy over build, we become their trusted partner with solutions that are no\\-brainers to buy and easy to use.
   

  

 The Team: From the merchandise stores at Sports venues to small\\-format stores such as Amazon Go, a new kind of technology is powering stores with no lines and no checkout. You simply use the Amazon app to enter the store, take what you want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals, grocery essentials and merchandise, and go.
   

  

 Our checkout\\-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out (JWO) Technology. It automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a cart. When you’re done shopping, you just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. Designed and custom\\-built by Amazonians, our technology uses computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning. Innovation is part of our DNA. We need people who want to join a high\\-reaching program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.
   

  

 The Role: Everyone on our team needs to be entrepreneurial, wear many hats and work in a highly collaborative environment that’s more startup than big company.

You will help invent new features, design, develop and deploy reliable distributed services. You will work with a variety of core languages and technologies including Java, C\\+\\+, Linux.
   

  

 You will tackle challenging situations every day and you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems. Along the way, we guarantee that you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on many customers.
   

  

 The Role: You are a talented Software Engineer who knows how to design and code full\\-stack solutions. You know how to get things done, and done really well. You are a dreamer and a futurist. You have an inventor’s spirit, a can\\-do approach and proficiency in a wide range of design technologies, and a killer eye for detail. We are looking for talented engineers for Java and AWS services.
   

  

 In this role you’ll have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game\\-changing initiative. While you’ll be able to use existing Amazon systems when possible, you’ll be working on challenging problems that need creative solutions. You should be comfortable building prototypes, challenging assumptions, and thinking of creative ways to tackle challenges.
   

  

**Basic Qualifications·**
* 3\\+ years of non\\-internship professional software development experience
* Programming experience with at least one modern language such as Java, C\\+\\+, or C\\# including object\\-oriented design

In this offering, the people and software are inextricably linked and cannot be separated. AMP delivery teams consist of application delivery engineers and a project manager who work onsite with the customer to modernize one or more of the customer’s applications in an accelerated timeframe. Our delivery teams leverage a mix of AI and deterministic custom tooling to expedite application delivery.
   

  

 MongoDB has various AMP delivery teams globally, supported by a small, central, non\\-customer\\-facing unit: the AMP Delivery Excellence team. This team elevates delivery effectiveness by developing and implementing the Application Transformation Framework (ATF), MongoDB's standardized process for modernizing applications. The team also creates tools to systematically track project delivery effectiveness, pinpointing inefficiencies that then drive product engineering and process improvements. Utilizing this data, the team collaborates with MongoDB’s internal Product Engineering team to shape the AMP product roadmap based on identified needs. Furthermore, the team uses AI to develop and evolve simulation applications that mimic common customer modernization challenges, helping to clearly identify product gaps and test the new features implemented by the Product Engineering team to address them.
   

  

 As a critical member of the AMP Delivery Excellence team, the Senior Practice Engineer will serve as the technical lead for innovating, building, and evolving the team's core assets and initiatives, collaborating closely with peers and the Technical Program Manager. This role partly involves working as a software developer in an Agile environment, innovating on solutions for specific challenges that help to evolve the AMP practice.
