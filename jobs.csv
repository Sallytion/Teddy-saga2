 NYD Systems is an Australia\\-based delivery team that helps organisations execute technology outcomes without chaos. We build and modernise software platforms, improve delivery capability, and support operational teams with reliable engineering practices. Clients work with us because we bring clarity, pace, and a bias towards production\\-grade work.
 



  





 We’re expanding into
 **Workflow Solutions** 
 to help clients operationalise service delivery and internal processes through platforms that enforce consistency and governance. ServiceNow is a strong fit for this because it turns ad hoc work into structured workflows, measurable SLAs, auditable change, and repeatable service experiences. The practice starts with
 **ITSM** 
 and expands across
 **CSM, HRSD, SPM, SecOps, and ITOM** 
 , depending on the client.
 



  





 Quality sits at the centre of this service line. We treat testing as release confidence and audit readiness, supported by
 **ATF automation** 
 , clear test evidence, and pipeline\\-friendly regression. Many of our clients operate in regulated environments, so we work with background checks, controlled access, and documentation standards aligned to ISO/SOC\\-style expectations.
 



  




 Role purpose
 
 Own quality across ServiceNow releases, combining pragmatic manual coverage with automation using
 **ATF** 
 and pipeline\\-friendly regression.
 



  




 What you’ll test
 
 ITSM plus adjacent modules (client\\-dependent):
 **CSM, HRSD, SPM, SecOps, ITOM** 
 , including catalog/portal, approvals, notifications, SLAs, integrations, and data integrity.
 



  




 Key responsibilities
 * Build test strategy, test plans, and traceability to requirements
* Execute functional, integration, regression, and UAT support testing
* Create and maintain
 **ATF suites** 
 for critical journeys and regression
* Validate integrations (API behaviour, payloads, failure handling, retries)
* Manage defect lifecycle with crisp reproduction steps and severity alignment
* Support DevOps\\-style release cycles: test evidence, sign\\-offs, release readiness
* Help establish quality standards across the bench (templates, checklists, coverage targets)


- 

 Experience \\& capability
 * Junior: \\~1–3 years QA experience; structured manual testing and good documentation habits
* Mid: \\~3–6 years; confident ownership of testing for releases and environments
* Senior: \\~6\\+ years; strong leadership in QA strategy, automation approach, and release governance
* Familiarity with ServiceNow testing practices;
 **ATF** 
 experience preferred
* Comfortable with distributed teams and time\\-boxed release windows


- 

 Compliance expectations (regulated clients)
 * Background checks as required
* Evidence\\-first mindset: test artefacts suitable for audit and governance expectations

 * Nice to have: CSA or testing certifications; ATF exposure highly valued.","IT System Custom Software Development","https://au.linkedin.com/company/nyd-systems","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQE_cl9uBRUNfQ/company-logo_100_100/B56ZhkDCR7HQAU-/0/1754025174557?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Wq4Qlu-9tztqKQ5bdfMNGaMgxGeDR-Od0mJa8zRnHQg","","","","","","","","","","",""
