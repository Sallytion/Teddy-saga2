"li-4375685241","linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4375685241","","Expert Backend Engineer (Go) — Fully Remote","Evomi","","","fulltime","","","","","",True,"mid-senior level","Engineering and Information Technology","","","About Us
 
 We build high\\-performance proxy infrastructure that powers data collection at scale. Our platform operates a global residential proxy network where real devices share bandwidth through our harvester system, and consumers route their traffic through those IPs to access the web without detection.
 



 Our backend handles tens of thousands of concurrent proxy connections, routes traffic through distributed harvester nodes in real time, and does things like TLS fingerprint mirroring, HTTP/2 frame\\-level manipulation, and MITM caching — all in Go. If you've ever wanted to work at the intersection of networking, performance engineering, and distributed systems, this is it.
 



 We're a small, fully remote team. No layers of management, no ticket queues. You'll ship features, debug production issues, and make architectural decisions — often in the same day.
   




 What You'll Work On
 * Proxy server core — Our Go\\-based proxy handles HTTP, HTTPS (CONNECT tunneling), SOCKS5 (TCP \\+ UDP), and WebSocket traffic. You'll work on the request pipeline: authentication, routing, harvester selection, bandwidth tracking, and response delivery.
* Harvester communication — Real devices connect to our network via WebSocket and communicate through NATS message brokers. You'll work on the connection lifecycle, health checks, geographic routing, and the pub/sub layer that bridges proxy servers with harvester nodes.
* TLS \\& anti\\-detection — Our MITM proxy captures TLS ClientHello fingerprints and replays them byte\\-for\\-byte on outbound connections, so target servers can't distinguish our traffic from a real browser. You'll work on TLS fingerprint mirroring, HTTP/2 fingerprint replication, and ECH (Encrypted Client Hello) support.
* Data infrastructure — Multiple PostgreSQL databases, a columnar database for sub\\-millisecond harvester queries, Redis\\-compatible stores for caching and counters, and async logging pipelines with high\\-capacity buffered channels.
* Rate limiting \\& abuse prevention — Lock\\-free, in\\-memory surge protection running inline on every request. Per\\-user sliding window counters, IP\\-based auth abuse blocking, DNS abuse prevention (SSRF protection), and banned user management.
* Admin \\& reseller APIs — RESTful APIs (Gin) for managing users, resellers, subusers, billing, payouts, and platform configuration. Multi\\-tenant architecture with API key and JWT authentication.


 What We're Looking For
 
  




 You should be strong in:
 * Go — Not just syntax. You understand goroutines, channels, mutexes, atomics, sync.Map, and context.Context deeply. You've written concurrent code that runs in production under load.
* Networking — You know how HTTP proxies work (CONNECT method, hop\\-by\\-hop headers, persistent connections). Bonus if you've worked with SOCKS5, TLS internals, or WebSocket at the protocol level.
* Databases — You're comfortable with PostgreSQL and an ORM like GORM. You understand connection pooling, query performance, and when to reach for raw SQL.
* Redis — You've used it for more than just caching. Counters, pipelines, cluster mode, TTL management.
* Systems thinking — You reason about memory usage, connection lifecycles, graceful shutdown, and what happens when things fail. You think about production, not just tests.



  




 Ideally, you also have experience with:
 * NATS or similar message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
* Dependency injection frameworks (Uber FX or similar)
* HAProxy, load balancing, or multi\\-region deployments
* Docker and container\\-based deployments
* Performance profiling with pprof
* TLS certificate management and crypto/tls
* Structured logging (Zap, zerolog)
* Columnar or analytical databases (ClickHouse, TimescaleDB, etc.)



  




 Mindset that fits:
 * You're comfortable in a small team where you own features end\\-to\\-end.
* You can navigate large codebases (some of our core files are 3,000\\+ lines) without getting lost.
* You debug with tcpdump and pprof, not just print statements.
* You care about performance but know when to optimize and when to ship.
* You communicate clearly in writing — we're remote\\-first and async\\-heavy.
* You move fast. We don't do two\\-week sprint ceremonies. When something needs building, we build it.



  




 What We Offer
 * Fully remote — Work from anywhere. No office, no mandatory hours, no commute.
* Small team, big impact — Your code runs in production the same week you write it. No bureaucracy.
* Hard technical problems — Low\\-level networking, high\\-concurrency Go, distributed systems, anti\\-detection engineering. This isn't CRUD.
* Autonomy — You decide how to solve problems. We care about outcomes, not process.
* Competitive compensation — Based on experience and location.



  




 How to Apply
 
 Send us a message with:
 


1. A brief intro — who you are and what excites you about this role.
2. Your experience with Go and any networking/proxy/distributed systems work.
3. A link to your GitHub, LinkedIn, or any relevant projects.



 We don't do algorithm whiteboard interviews. We'll have a technical conversation about real systems, look at how you think through problems, and potentially do a small paid trial project together.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://ch.linkedin.com/company/evomi","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQG7wUXkJKQ7NQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1723487247322/evomi_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=YgOjjlWPTIJPJN4MF5Kv7nGgUDIUeeHcQrz-zlx2-Pw","","","","","","","","","","",""
