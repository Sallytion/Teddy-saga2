**About Turing:** 




 Based in San Francisco, California, Turing is the world’s leading research accelerator for frontier AI labs and a trusted partner for global enterprises deploying advanced AI systems. Turing supports customers in two ways: first, by accelerating frontier research with high\\-quality data, advanced training pipelines, plus top AI researchers who specialize in software engineering, logical reasoning, STEM, multilinguality, multimodality, and agents; and second, by applying that expertise to help enterprises transform AI from proof of concept into proprietary intelligence with systems that perform reliably, deliver measurable impact, and drive lasting results on the P\\&L.

**What You’ll Do:** 



* Implement and refine features in production\\-grade Rust codebases.
* Diagnose, debug, and resolve ownership, borrowing, and concurrency challenges.
* Design comprehensive tests (unit, integration, property\\-based) to enforce safety.
* Improve development environments, dependencies, and performance.
* Document trade\\-offs and guide architectural decisions.



  





**What We’re Looking For:** 



* 2\\+ years of professional Rust within 3\\+ years total industry experience.
