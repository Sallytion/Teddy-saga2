**About KAVIA AI** 


 KAVIA AI is an enterprise software company building a
 
**production AI\\-native platform** 

 used today by real teams on real, large\\-scale codebases.
 





 We are creating an
 
**AI\\-native workflow and reasoning layer for the entire software development lifecycle** 

 — from requirements and architecture to code generation, testing, CI/CD, and long\\-term evolution. Unlike point tools or copilots, KAVIA is designed to understand, reason about, and operate on
 
**entire systems over time** 

 , not just individual prompts or files.
 





 At the core of the platform are:
 



* **Agent\\-based orchestration systems** 

 that plan, execute, and validate work across the SDLC
* 
* **Enterprise knowledge graphs** 

 that represent code, architecture, requirements, and decisions
* 
* **Full lifecycle traceability** 

 , enabling teams to understand
 
*why* 

 software exists and
 
*how* 

 it evolves


- 



 KAVIA is already deployed in production environments and used by enterprise customers. As the platform and customer footprint grow, we’re hiring engineers to help scale, harden, and evolve the core systems that power KAVIA.
 



**The Role** 


 This is a
 
**hands\\-on software engineering role** 

 on an existing, production AI platform.
 





 As a
 
**Software Engineer** 

 , you’ll work closely with senior engineers and the founding team to design, implement, and operate
 
**core backend systems, frontend interfaces, and AI\\-native workflows** 

 that are already used by enterprise customers.
 





 You’ll contribute directly to foundational platform components, gain exposure to real architectural tradeoffs, and gradually take ownership of meaningful subsystems. This role is ideal for engineers who want to work on
 
**serious, long\\-lived systems** 

 and learn how modern AI\\-native platforms are built responsibly.
 



**What You’ll Do** 
**Build and Evolve the Platform** 
* Implement backend services and APIs that power KAVIA’s AI\\-native workflows
* 
* Contribute to agent\\-based orchestration systems that plan and execute complex tasks

* Work with
 
**knowledge\\-graph\\-driven representations** 

 of code, workflows, and metadata
* 
* Extend, refactor, and harden systems already running in production


- 

**Hands\\-On Engineering** 
* Write clean, well\\-tested, production\\-quality code
* 
* Participate in design discussions and code reviews
* 
* Debug issues across backend services, AI workflows, and system integrations
* 
* Improve performance, reliability, and observability of core services


- 

**Production \\& Operations** 
* Deploy and operate services in cloud environments using containerized systems
* 
* Support production systems used by enterprise customers
* 
* Learn to reason about scalability, failure modes, and long\\-term system health


- 

**Collaboration \\& Growth** 
* Work closely with senior engineers and learn from real architectural decisions
* 
* Translate well\\-defined requirements into robust implementations
* 
* Gradually grow ownership across backend systems, AI workflows, and infrastructure


- 

**What We’re Looking For** 
**Required** 
* \\~3\\+ years of professional software engineering experience
* 
* Strong backend engineering fundamentals, especially with
 
**Python**
* 
* Experience building APIs and backend services used in production
* 
* Experience working with
 
**React or Next.js** 

 \\-based frontend systems
* 
* Familiarity with data storage systems (relational databases and modern data stores)
* 
* Experience deploying and operating services in a cloud environment
* 
* Comfort working in a fast\\-moving environment with real users and real constraints


- 

**Strong Plus** 
* Experience with
 
**Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines**
* 
* Experience with
 
**MongoDB** 

 and
 
**AWS\\-based infrastructure**
* 
* Experience using AI tools as part of your own development workflow
* 
* Experience operating production systems with uptime and reliability requirements

 — not prototypes or experiments
* 
* Learn how
 **AI\\-native systems are designed, built, and operated at scale**
* 
* Be close to architecture, product decisions, and long\\-term technical direction
* 
* Solve hard problems at the intersection of
 
**AI, systems engineering, and enterprise software**
