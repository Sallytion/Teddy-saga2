Banks need to leapfrog into an era of connected devices and omnipresent commerce. Banking should become an integral part of the commerce and enterprise systems, thereby enabling seamless consumer and business transactions. The average number of interactions an account holder may have with a bank would increase to 12\\-15 per day in the near\\-term from the current average of 3\\-4 transactions per month. These could grow to an unimaginably large number in the future. Most banking systems aren’t designed for this scale. In many ways, these systems are limiting the imagination of the key stakeholders at the banks. We want this changed fundamentally, in an interoperable and regulatorily compliant manner.
   

  

 We build large\\-scale transaction processing systems that can work with many current and future payment networks. We build applications that help banks realize the value of this new approach early. We also help banks to rapidly deliver the value of these applications to their customers.
