 We welcome candidates at various experience levels for this role. During the interview process, candidates will be assessed for the appropriate level, and offers will align with that level, which may differ from the one in this posting.
   

  

**Who You Are**
* You have built and maintained testbenches for complex designs such CPU, GPU etc using SystemVerilog, UVM, and C\\+\\+.

**What We Need**
* Someone to design and grow a UVM testbench setup that works for both block\\-level and full\\-chip simulation.
* The ability to write C\\+\\+ code that fits into a DV framework — and help shape that framework as it evolves.
* A good understanding of CPU microarchitecture and how to test it effectively.
* Comfort working across tools, from open\\-source simulators like Verilator to commercial environments and emulators.


**What You Will Learn**
* How to design testbenches that scale with complexity — and keep them maintainable as the chip grows.
* How to support both simulation and emulation from the same DV infrastructure.
* How custom C\\+\\+ and UVM environments can coexist to improve verification workflows.
* How different teams — RTL, DV, software, tools etc — come together to build AI\\-focused silicon.
