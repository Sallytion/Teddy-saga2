**Job Description**
**About OrbitronAI:**
**OrbitronAI** 
 delivers enterprise\\-ready AI agentic solutions designed to automate and optimize complex business workflows. Its platform enables organizations to deploy and manage fully autonomous AI agents that integrate seamlessly with existing systems. With a focus on scalability, security, and real\\-time intelligence, OrbitronAI empowers enterprises to accelerate digital transformation through next\\-generation AI automation.
   

  

**Why This Role**
 AI agents are only as useful as the interfaces they live in. At OrbitronAI, we're building intelligent systems that act, plan, and reason — however they need clean, intuitive, responsive UIs that help users trust and guide them. That's where you come in. You'll partner directly with AI engineers and backend developers to create frontend experiences for agent orchestration dashboards, workflow builders, conversational UIs, agent state visualizations, and more. Your code will shape how people understand, interact with, and control AI agents across industries. If you love turning abstract complexity into elegant product experiences — and want to help define the future of how humans and agents work together — this is your role. Bonus: You'll work in an environment where using AI tools to boost your own efficiency is expected, not optional.
   

  

**What You Bring**
* 4\\+ years experience building production web apps with React, TypeScript, Next.js, or equivalent frameworks
* Solid understanding of modern frontend architecture, performance optimization, and security best practices
* Experience integrating with REST APIs and working with real\\-time data (e.g., websockets, server\\-sent events)
* You've built and scaled component libraries, design systems, or enterprise\\-grade dashboards before
* Strong eye for design — you care about micro\\-interactions, layout, spacing, and UX clarity
* Bonus if you have: Experience working with LLM/AI interfaces (conversational, RAG viewers, prompt editors, etc.)
* Built internal tools or low\\-code/no\\-code frontends
* Worked in a startup environment with fast shipping cycles
* Familiarity with tools like TailwindCSS is a plus


**What You'll Do**
* You'll architect and develop modern, fast, and highly usable web applications that serve as the primary interface between enterprise users and our LLM\\-driven agents. These apps will power agent deployment, monitoring, and interaction — and must feel intuitive, real\\-time, and reliable
* Collaborate with AI and backend teams to design frontend components that visualize: Agent states, tasks, and memory, Real\\-time workflow execution (via Temporal, n8n, etc.), Embedding/RAG insights, search relevance, and data pipelines
* Build intuitive UIs for agent builders, dashboards, and multi\\-agent visualizations
* Own end\\-to\\-end feature development — from Figma wireframes to pixel\\-perfect implementation and production deployment
* Ensure everything you ship is clean, accessible, responsive, and secure — from mobile views to enterprise dashboards
* Work closely with product and design to maintain a high standard of UX polish and performance
* Contribute to our design system and component library, driving consistency across the platform and products


**Benefits**
* Founding Team Role with Salary \\+ Equity
* Flexible PTO and work hours
