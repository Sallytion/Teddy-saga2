If you’re passionate about designing resilient infrastructure, automating deployments, and enabling hundreds of workloads across multiple regions, this role is for you. You’ll work with cutting\\-edge technologies like Kubernetes, Istio, Envoy, Terraform, modern observability stacks and collaborate with teams worldwide to deliver a unified hosting experience.
 

  
 





 If you’re passionate about deep platform and infrastructure engineering, solving complex scaling challenges, and enabling teams through elegant, automated solutions—this role is for you.
 

  
 




**About the Team**

  
 





 Our Cloud Compute Platform
 


 Engineering team is at the heart of Roku’s transformation toward a single, unified platform. We design and scale Kubernetes clusters, service mesh architecture, and supporting systems to ensure all engineering teams speak the same infrastructure language. We partner with internal teams to migrate workloads, enhance CI/CD pipelines, and integrate observability and security into every layer of the stack. Collaboration and impact are core to what we do.
 

  
 




**What You’ll Be Doing**

  
 



* Architect, design, and deploy Roku’s next\\-generation cloud platform and service mesh.
* Build and own solutions to Roku's compute problems using Docker, Kubernetes, Istio/Envoy, Terraform and scripting to evolve our tech stack and deployments.
* Proactively drive the research and implementation of new technologies to enhance scalability, reliability, and developer experience.
* Integrate security best practices into infrastructure design and automation.
* Build tooling to visualize inefficiencies and optimize costs across shared\\-tenancy clusters, including network traffic insights, cross\\-cluster communication efficiency, and cost attribution.
* Collaborate with internal teams to migrate workloads to Kubernetes \\+ Istio, leveraging open\\-source observability tools.
* Work closely with the Observability team to scale monitoring and logging solutions for a holistic view of the platform.
* Leverage SRE principles to maintain high availability and streamline onboarding workflows.
* Mentor team members and help define best practices for infrastructure and automation.

* Ability to work independently and communicate effectively with technical and non\\-technical stakeholders.
* Passion for learning and solving complex infrastructure challenges.
* Experience integrating AI tools to improve processes and reduce operational toil (a plus).
* Master’s degree or equivalent experience (8\\+ years preferred).



  
 



  
 


**Our Hybrid Work Approach** 

 Roku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy.
 



  
 


**Benefits** 

 Roku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs.

 Roku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com.
 



  
 


**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.
