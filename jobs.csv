 Whatfix is an AI platform advancing the “userization” of enterprise applications, empowering companies to maximize the ROI of their digital investments. Technology needs adoption. It’s no different for AI. As AI reshapes roles, workflows, and human\\-machine interactions, it also introduces new layers of complexity and user friction. This is where Whatfix plays a pivotal role.
