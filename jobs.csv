 **Together, we advance your career.**
**Role Overview**
 Responsible for verifying latest gen complex Ryzen CPU clusters/blocks using formal methods. You'll engage on creation of formal proofs, abstraction models, and verification strategies to ensure correctness, collaborating closely with architects, RTL designers, and validation teams.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Formal Verification \\& Proof Development
+ Perform formal verification (model checking, equivalence checking) on CPU microarchitecture/IP blocks.
+ Develop formal proofs, abstraction models, and convergence methodologies to maximize coverage and bug hunting.

* Test Planning \\& Strategy
+ Generate comprehensive formal verification plans: scope, coverage goals, strategy, and proof approaches.
+ Lead ROI analysis to balance formal vs. dynamic methodologies.

* Collaboration \\& Debugging
+ Work with architects, RTL designers, and verification teams to resolve failing assertions and improve design quality. Look for potential sign\\-off for critical blocks to guarantee exhaustive proof and reduce silicon escapes.
+ Support post\\-silicon failure debug and sighting resolution when required.

* Methodology \\& Infrastructure Development
+ Maintain and enhance formal infrastructure (flows, abstraction techniques, tools)
+ Investigate new formal techniques and define reusable verification methodologies for the team


**Qualifications \\& Skills**
**Education**
* Bachelor’s, Master’s, or Ph.D. in Computer Engineering, Electrical/Electronic Engineering, Computer Science, or related field.


**Experience**
* 5\\-10 years exp in formal verification for logic/microarchitecture IP— preferably CPU\\-related.
* Proven experience using formal engines (e.g. JasperGold, VC Formal) for bug hunting.
* Skilled in assertion languages (SystemVerilog Assertions) and HDL modeling (Verilog/VHDL/SV)
* Strong scripting or programming ability (Python, Tcl, Perl)


**Soft Skills**
* Analytical mindset with intellectual curiosity; ability to uncover hidden verification gaps.
* Exceptional communicator and collaborator in cross\\-functional environments.
* Mentorship or technical ownership experience—leading reviews and guiding junior engineers.


**Preferred**
* Deep understanding of CPU microarchitecture topics (in\\-order/out\\-of\\-order execution, pipelines, memory consistency, coherence, ISA, security, floating\\-point, etc.)
* Advanced degree (M.S. or Ph.D.) specializing in formal methods or microarchitecture.
* Experience with CPU post\\-silicon validation and debug.
* Familiarity with SoC verification flows, security IPs (e.g., secure enclaves), or system\\-level proof approaches.


**Why This Matters**
 This role is pivotal in ensuring the
 **correctness and robustness** 
 of CPU designs by leveraging rigorous formal verification methods. As CPU microarchitectures grow more complex—with deeper pipelines, wider issue widths, and intricate memory hierarchies—formal techniques are essential to catch subtle bugs early and guarantee product reliability.

Conventional QA methodologies, including those employing rudimentary automation, often miss critical defects until it's too late, resulting in expensive setbacks and dissatisfied end users. Industry data reveals that more than 60% of software defects surface after release, and quality\\-related issues impose costs exceeding $2 trillion annually on the global software industry. Meeting the need for quicker, more dependable software requires a fundamental transformation in quality assurance strategy.
   

  

 IgniteTech is spearheading this transformation by embedding GenAI capabilities throughout the entire QA lifecycle. Through AI\\-powered simulation of user interactions, generation of sophisticated test scenarios, and analysis of defect patterns, we achieve accelerated delivery with reduced bug counts. By joining our team, you position yourself at the cutting edge of this evolution, leveraging AI to remove bottlenecks and anticipate issues before they materialize.
   

  

 This is not a conventional QA role. If you seek a traditional setting focused on manual test runs or repetitive scripted automation, look elsewhere. In this position, you will take ownership of building and advancing AI\\-powered test automation platforms, apply predictive analytics to surface latent risks, and contribute directly to redefining software quality standards. You will serve as the designer of adaptive, scalable solutions suited to the demands of contemporary development—not simply another participant in an inflexible, legacy workflow. If this resonates with the challenge you've been seeking, submit your application and help define the next chapter of software development.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Build and sustain AI\\-driven test automation frameworks that produce test cases, automation scripts, and validation data for thorough coverage
* Leverage GenAI platforms to evaluate test results, detect defect patterns, and deliver actionable recommendations for ongoing enhancement
* Model user interactions, load scenarios, and boundary conditions to detect potential failures before they reach production


**Senior Software Quality Assurance Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Apply AI and automation technologies to accelerate product delivery and minimize defect rates


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your instinct is to write code first and then use AI tools to verify or enhance your code, rather than the other way around, then please do not apply)
* At least 2 years of experience in a QA automation role
* Proficiency in Selenium and one of the following languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
* Professional experience using AI tools to automate QA workflows
* Familiarity with CI/CD platforms, such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions
