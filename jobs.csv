**Our Pillars**
* Valuing nature: How we impact nature affects how nature impacts us. Resilient ecosystems \\- the foundation of a sustainable planet and society \\- are essential to our future. We’re committed to protecting and restoring nature \\- from mangrove forests to the bees in our backyard \\- by increasing biodiversity awareness and inspiring clients and colleagues to put nature at the heart of their plans.
* Addressing climate change: The effects of a changing climate are far\\-reaching and significant. Unpredictable weather, increasing temperatures, and rising sea levels cause both social inequalities and environmental disruption. We're building a net zero strategy, developing insurance products and services, and mobilizing to advance thought leadership and investment in societal\\-led solutions.
* Integrating ESG: All companies have a role to play in building a more resilient future. Incorporating ESG considerations into our internal processes and practices builds resilience from the roots of our business. We’re training our colleagues, engaging our external partners, and evolving our sustainability governance and reporting.
* AXA Hearts in Action: We have established volunteering and charitable giving programs to help colleagues support causes that matter most to them, known as AXA XL’s “Hearts in Action” programs. These include our Matching Gifts program, Volunteering Leave, and our annual volunteering day \\- the Global Day of Giving.
