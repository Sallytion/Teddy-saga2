 Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.
   

  

 Rippling Payroll is redefining how companies pay their people across the world — turning payroll from a cost center into a strategic advantage. Built on Rippling Unity — our unified workforce platform — Payroll connects HR, IT, and Finance so every policy, approval, and pay calculation automatically stays in sync across systems and countries.
   

  

 With $750M\\+ ARR, \\>23,000 customers, and \\>$70B in annualized payroll volume, we’re building the most intelligent, automated, and compliant payroll infrastructure on the planet.
   

  

****The Opportunity****
 We’re looking for a
 ****Senior Staff Software Engineer****
 to help architect and scale Rippling’s
 ****next\\-generation Global Payroll Platform****
 — a system that powers payments, compliance, and computation for millions of employees across 50\\+ countries.
   

  

 This role sits at the intersection of
 ****AI\\-powered automation****
 ,
 ****compliance\\-as\\-code****
 , and
 ****massive scale****
 — with direct ownership over core systems that define how Rippling processes global payroll, taxes, and payments at sub\\-second latency and near\\-zero error tolerance.
   

  

**What You’ll Own**
* Architect Rippling’s next\\-gen Payroll computation engine — modular, extensible, and capable of encoding multi\\-jurisdictional compliance logic declaratively.
* Design data models and pipelines that handle versioned pay runs, audit trails, retroactive corrections, and time\\-based computations at global scale.
* Build scalable rules engines to automate ever\\-changing tax, benefits, and labor laws across jurisdictions, ensuring compliance through dynamic, AI\\-generated logic.
* Modernize global payment infrastructure for real\\-time or near\\-instant disbursements while balancing reconciliation, fraud detection, and regulatory constraints.
* Evolve reporting and permissions systems to deliver real\\-time insights and granular access controls for complex, multi\\-entity organizations.
* Partner with Product, Compliance, and Finance teams to convert ambiguous regulatory specs into clear, deterministic system behavior.
* Lead high\\-impact initiatives like sandboxed “simulation” payrolls, AI\\-powered paystub explainability, and what\\-if analysis for enterprises.
* Shape the long\\-term platform vision, influencing 150\\+ engineers across Finance and HR Infrastructure as a multiplier, mentor, and architectural authority.


**What Success Looks Like**
* System Reliability: Sub\\-second computation accuracy for global pay runs, with zero critical compliance defects.
* Extensibility: New countries, pay types, and tax rules added with minimal engineering overhead.
* Performance: Orders of magnitude improvement in latency and cost efficiency across distributed computation.
* Developer Velocity: Simplified APIs, testing frameworks, and onboarding for internal and partner developers.
* Business Impact: Reduction in country onboarding time, payroll failure rates, and manual compliance interventions.


**What We’re Looking For**
* 14\\+ years of experience building large\\-scale distributed systems in high\\-compliance or high\\-integrity domains (Finance, Payroll, Tax, Insurance, etc.).
* Deep expertise in data architecture, domain\\-driven design, and rule\\-based / event\\-driven systems.
* Experience scaling compliance\\-heavy, multi\\-country systems — ideally payroll, tax, or financial computation platforms.
* Proficiency in designing modular service boundaries, ensuring backward compatibility and auditability.
* Strong understanding of computation correctness, versioned state, precision handling, and retroactive adjustments.
* Proven ability to partner across functions — translating legal/compliance constraints into elegant, maintainable systems.
* A strong architectural voice who can both design systems and mentor teams to scale them sustainably.


****Bonus Points****
* Experience with AI\\-driven system automation or compliance\\-as\\-code frameworks.
* Hands\\-on work with global payroll systems, real\\-time payments, or statutory tax logic.
* Familiarity with event sourcing, CQRS, streaming pipelines, and immutable data stores.
* Contributions to open\\-source distributed computation frameworks or rule engines.


****Why Rippling****
* Backed by world\\-class investors (Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, Bedrock, GIC, Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs)
* Valued among the fastest\\-growing SaaS companies in history
* Build at the heart of Rippling’s Finance platform, where Payroll, Spend, Bill Pay, and Banking converge into a unified ecosystem.
* Join a team that pushes the limits of possible, builds winning systems, and moves fast with conviction.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/rippling","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGVw6UsjqtXGw/company-logo_100_100/B4EZlN73QeHIAQ-/0/1757949162831/rippling_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=_-PZ3E8XmdCyc89UhLvip3soyI97bY1FRM89cZYXEiQ","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large‑scale language models are evolving from clever chatbots into powerful engines of enterprise modernization. With high‑quality training data, tomorrow’s AI can democratize legacy‑systems expertise, keep pace with core‑banking and insurance transformation, and streamline mainframe workflows for teams everywhere. That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI.
   

  

 We’re looking for COBOL specialists who live and breathe IBM z/OS mainframe development, batch and online processing, CICS transaction systems, JCL orchestration, DB2/IMS data access, VSAM file design, TSO/ISPF tooling, and Micro Focus COBOL. You’ll challenge advanced language models on topics like copybook architecture and record layouts, EBCDIC/ASCII conversion, program/performance tuning, error triage for ABENDs (S0C7/S0C4\\), transaction integrity and commit/rollback, parallel batch strategies and scheduling (CA7/Control‑M), message‑queue integration (IBM MQ), API/REST/SOAP interop from COBOL, and code review/refactoring patterns—documenting every failure mode so we can harden model reasoning.
   

  

 On a typical day, you will converse with the model on real‑world mainframe scenarios and theoretical software‑engineering questions, verify factual accuracy and logical soundness, capture reproducible error traces (SQLCODEs, dump analysis, Abend‑AID/Fault Analyzer output), and suggest improvements to our prompt engineering and evaluation metrics.
   

  

 A bachelor’s or master’s in computer science, information systems, or a closely related field is ideal; production COBOL/CICS/DB2 delivery, legacy application modernization, or hands‑on mainframe DevOps (Endevor/ChangeMan, RACF awareness, Git for z/OS, REXX scripting) signal fit. Clear, metacognitive communication—“showing your work”—is essential.
   

  

 Ready to turn your COBOL expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world.
   

  

 We offer a pay range of $6\\-to\\- $65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above. As a contractor you’ll supply a secure computer and high‑speed internet; company‑sponsored benefits such as health insurance and PTO do not apply.
