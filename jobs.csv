 Hey Future Figment Family Member!
 



  





 Ever dreamt of building digital products that feel as thoughtfully crafted as a heritage shophouse? Well, we did — and we’re
 **Figment** 
 , the rebels of hospitality, making the world a more human place to live.
 



  





 Our boutique hotel\\-inspired homes have been called the
 *“Picassos of Singapore’s Built Heritage”* 
 by
 **Travel \\+ Leisure** 
 , with features in
 **The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Straits Times** 
 , and
 **Channel NewsAsia** 
 . Over the past 35 years, we’ve welcomed more than
 **4,000 members** 
 from companies like
 **Grab, BCG, and Citi** 
 .
 



  





**What Makes This Role Different:** 



* **100% Remote\\-First:** 
 Work from home, a café, or anywhere that inspires you. We're entirely results and KPI\\-driven (Key Performance Indicators \\= measurable outcomes), not face\\-time driven. Note: Remote\\-first means self\\-discipline and clear communication are essential.
* **Accelerated Growth:** 
 Staff take on significant responsibilities from day one in our hands\\-on scrappy startup environment. As we aggressively expand our team, you'll grow alongside us with clear progression paths and potential phantom equity eligibility.
* **Global Conservation Mission:** 
 As stewards of Singapore's architectural heritage, we're pioneering the boutique homes concept globally—from London townhouses to Spanish Colonial homes in Intramuros, Manila, to colonial bungalows across India.



  





 Now, we’re building the digital backbone that powers these experiences — from internal tools to member\\-facing platforms. We’re looking for a
 **Developer** 
 who blends technical rigor with product intuition, and who believes great software should feel invisible, elegant, and human.

4. Ensure systems are reliable, secure, and performant as the business scales.



**Systems \\& Architecture (20%)** 



1. Contribute to technical architecture decisions with scalability and simplicity in mind.
2. Improve existing codebases through refactoring, documentation, and performance optimization.
3. Design APIs, data models, and workflows that support operational efficiency.
4. Balance speed of execution with long\\-term technical health.



**Cross\\-Functional Collaboration (20%)** 



1. Work closely with operations, design, growth, and leadership teams to understand real\\-world needs.
2. Participate in product discussions, offering technical perspectives and trade\\-offs.
3. Support non\\-technical teammates by building tools that simplify workflows and reduce manual work.



**Quality, Testing \\& Deployment (15%)** 



1. Write clean, well\\-tested, and well\\-documented code.
2. Own deployments, monitoring, and debugging in production.
3. Proactively identify and fix bugs, edge cases, and performance bottlenecks.
4. Maintain high engineering standards while shipping iteratively.



  





**Core Competencies** 



1. 2–4 years of experience as a software developer or engineer
2. Strong proficiency in at least one modern backend language/framework (e.g. Node.js, Python, Ruby, etc.)
3. Comfortable working with databases, APIs, and cloud infrastructure
4. Strong problem\\-solving skills and attention to detail
5. Ability to work independently while collaborating closely with a small team
6. Interest in building products for real humans, not just abstract users
7. Full\\-stack development experience, including external API integrations; experience in technical architecture design is a plus.
8. Implement AI solutions that integrate with existing business systems to enhance functionality and user interaction.
9. Stay up to date with advancements by researching and implementing the latest developments in AI and other frameworks



  





**Success Metrics / KPIs** 



1. Features shipped on time and aligned with product requirements
2. System reliability (uptime, error rates, incident frequency)
3. Code quality metrics (test coverage, review feedback, maintainability)
4. Reduction in manual or operational overhead through tooling
5. Speed of iteration (cycle time from idea to deployment)
6. Internal stakeholder satisfaction with tools and platforms



  





**Cultural Fit / Values** 



1. Believes software should serve people, not the other way around

If you're ready to make an impact and grow your career, Legion is where you belong. Join us in making hourly work rewarding and fulfilling.
   

  

**BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY**
 There are almost 75 million hourly workers in the United States, representing more than half of the entire workforce. Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees. The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig\\-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options. Legion's mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by Legion's Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously.
   

  

 Legion WFM was built for the cloud with AI at the core and is designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses and meet the needs of today's hourly employees. Our team is comprised of dedicated individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, globally distributed across all time zones.
