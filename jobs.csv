 Urban Company started as UrbanClap in November 2014, when its founders, Abhiraj, Raghav, and Varun, realized that the home services industry was predominantly unorganized, fragmented, and offline. Customers found it challenging to avail quality services conveniently, and service professionals were struggling to make ends meet, having to rely upon several
 



 middlemen, contractors, and local aggregators. The founders felt that the industry was ripe for disruption, and launched Urban Company, with three key principles in mind \\-
 



  





 1\\. Customer love: Build a platform that offers truly delightful and differentiated services
 



 2\\. Partner empowerment: Build a deep, full\\-stack partnership with service partners, helping improve their earnings and overall livelihood
 



 3\\. Technology first: Bring innovation and technology to an age\\-old industry

**You Are a Good Fit If You Have:** 




  




* 0 to 1 year of experience in embedded firmware development, preferably in IoT smart appliances or wearable devices.
* Experience with ESP32 or similar Wi\\-Fi/BLE\\-enabled MCUs, OTA support, and secure boot.
* Practical experience with sensor integration and calibration (e.g., TDS, flow, hall, temperature, humidity, capacitive touch) for smart products such as smart locks, RO purifiers, and other connected devices.
* Strong programming skills in C/C\\+\\+ and familiarity with assembly language for low\\-level hardware interfacing.
* Expertise with debugging and analysis tools (JTAG, SWD, logic analyzers) and performing root\\-cause analysis in real\\-time systems.
* In\\-depth understanding of concurrency handling: semaphores, inter\\-process communication, deadlocks, and multi\\-core synchronization.
* Ability to thrive in a fast\\-paced, high\\-ownership environment.
