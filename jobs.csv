**Description \\& Requirements**
**About the Team:**
 The Storage and Compute Stability team ensure the reliability, performance, and security of Bloomberg’s cloud storage and compute infrastructure. We operate across infrastructure, software and services, proactively identifying and preventing issues before they impact our users.
   

  

 This is a software engineering role with a strong Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) focus. You’ll write production\\-quality code to build tools and automation, and you’ll own how our storage and compute platforms run in production. If you’re looking for a pure application development role focused on product features, this likely isn’t the right match.
   

  

 Our focus is on streamlining processes, driving automation, and acting as a bridge between product teams and stakeholders so that Bloomberg’s engineers can innovate rapidly while maintaining stability at scale. We follow agile practices and thrive on code reviews, design discussions and collaborative problem solving.
   

  

 You’ll have the opportunity to work on critical infrastructure, take on projects that balance immediate impact with sustainable improvements, and join a culture that values innovation, automation, and continuous improvement.
   

  

**We’ll Trust You To**
* Ensure the reliability and performance of compute and storage services through effective monitoring, troubleshooting and optimization
* Design and build software tools and automation (primarily in Python, with some C/C\\+\\+) for deployments, monitoring, incident response, maintenance and capacity management
* Proactively identify issues and trends to prevent outages, reduce mean time to recovery (MTTR) and improve overall service availability
* Participate in on\\-call rotations for critical infrastructure, respond to incidents, and drive follow\\-ups and post\\-incident reviews
* Collaborate with product owners, developers, and infrastructure teams to deliver scalable, long\\-term solutions
* Contribute to infrastructure lifecycle management, including capacity forecasting, refresh planning, and upgrades
* Develop and maintain runbooks, reproducers, and documentation to support knowledge sharing and efficient workflows
* Continuously look for ways to improve team processes and system stability


**How We Work And What Makes You Successful**
* You build deep technical expertise to tackle complex infrastructure challenges
* You’re proactive, anticipating issues and designing systems that can withstand failure
* You value collaboration, building strong relationships with product and infrastructure teams
* You have a bias for automation and efficiency, reducing manual and repetitive work
* You communicate clearly, especially when explaining technical concepts to diverse audiences
* You’re comfortable in an agile environment (standups, planning, code reviews) and keen to learn across the infrastructure stack


 You’ll enjoy this role if you like debugging complex production issues and building tooling to prevent them happening again more than working on new product features
   

  

**You’ll Need To Have**
* 5\\+ years of demonstrated software engineering experience with object\\-oriented programming languages such as C/C\\+\\+ and Python, and the willingness to work with Python as your primary language on the job
* Experience with monitoring, logging, and observability tools
* Understanding of containers and orchestration technologies
* Solid knowledge of networking, operating systems, and distributed systems concepts
* Experience participating in incident response and on\\-call support for production systems


**We’d Love To See**
* Familiarity with cloud platforms (Ceph or OpenStack) and related compute/storage services
* Experience with infrastructure\\-as\\-code tools (e.g. Terraform, Ansible)
