 We are looking for an experienced Java Developer to architect and deliver a robust, cloud\\-ready backend platform powering AI\\-enabled healthcare workflows. This role is foundational to building our data services layer and integrating cutting\\-edge clinical interoperability tools. You will have full ownership of designing scalable APIs, secure data pipelines, and event\\-driven microservices that help clinicians access and interact with life\\-critical health data. Your impact will directly shape our AI assistant and interoperability ecosystem.
   

  

**Key responsibilities include:**
* Architecting, building, and maintaining high\\-performance Java backend services with Spring Boot, Hibernate, and modern frameworks
* Designing scalable, secure RESTful APIs and event\\-driven microservices leveraging FHIR and openEHR healthcare data standards
* Implementing data pipelines to handle ETL, real\\-time ingestion, and AI inference integration with large language models and knowledge graphs
* Optimizing system performance, memory usage, and reliability for high\\-concurrency, high\\-availability distributed systems
* Integrating external medical data sources and third\\-party APIs (HL7, SMART on FHIR, SNOMED CT)
* Creating robust CI/CD pipelines with automated testing, containerized deployments (Docker, Kubernetes), and zero\\-downtime release strategies
* Ensuring all code adheres to healthcare regulatory standards (HIPAA, GDPR) and is auditable, secure, and highly maintainable
* Leveraging AI\\-powered development tools, static analysis, and code quality automation to accelerate iteration
* Designing auditable data storage strategies (PostgreSQL/SQL, NoSQL) and optimizing query performance for medical workflows
* Building asynchronous, message\\-based processing using Kafka, ActiveMQ, or comparable tools
* Documenting system architecture, data models, and API contracts for open\\-source and enterprise consumers


**Requirements**
**Must have:**
* 3\\+ years of production Java backend development, with exposure to large\\-scale, distributed systems

* Strong architecture/design skills: building reliable, scalable APIs and services
* Familiarity with security, access control, and cryptography best practices for healthcare data
* Proficiency building and optimizing SQL and NoSQL databases
* Hands\\-on experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes)
* CI/CD mastery: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or similar tools
* Experience integrating AI/ML inference in backend workflows (REST, gRPC, or async)
* Comfort working autonomously and owning end\\-to\\-end delivery


**Nice to have:**
* Knowledge of event\\-driven architectures and messaging systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)
* Previous work in healthcare IT, telehealth, or regulated industries
* Experience with FHIR, openEHR, HL7, or other healthcare data standards
* Familiarity with cloud\\-native services (AWS, GCP, Azure) and infrastructure as code

* Contributions to open\\-source Java, AI, or FHIR projects
* Experience with DevOps, observability, and SRE practices


**What This Role Is Not**
* Not a junior developer position, requires independent system architecture capability
* Not traditional CRUD API work, you will build complex, interoperable, AI\\-driven workflow systems
