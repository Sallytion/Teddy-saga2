 Our mission is to build the next generation of AI: ubiquitous, interactive intelligence that runs wherever you are. Today, not even the best models can continuously process and reason over a year\\-long stream of audio, video and text‚Äî1B text tokens, 10B audio tokens and 1T video tokens‚Äîlet alone do this on\\-device.
   

  

 We're pioneering the model architectures that will make this possible. Our founding team met as PhDs at the Stanford AI Lab, where we invented State Space Models or SSMs, a new primitive for training large\\-scale foundation models. Our team combines deep expertise in model innovation and systems engineering paired with a design\\-minded product engineering team to build and ship cutting edge models and experiences.
   

  

 We're funded by leading investors at Index Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, along with Factory, Conviction, A Star, General Catalyst, SV Angel, Databricks and others. We're fortunate to have the support of many amazing advisors, and 90\\+ angels across many industries, including the world's foremost experts in AI.

* Build highly parallel, high quality data processing and evaluation infrastructure for foundation model training


 You'll have significant autonomy to shape our products and directly impact how cutting\\-edge AI is applied across various devices and applications.
   

  

**What You'll Bring**
 Given the scale and difficulty of problems we work on, we value strong engineering skills at Cartesia.
   

  

* Strong engineering skills, comfortable navigating complex codebases and monorepos.
* An eye for craft and writing clean and maintainable code.
* You're comfortable diving into new technologies and can quickly adapt your skills to our tech stack (Go and Python on the backend, Next.js for the frontend).
* Experience building large\\-scale distributed systems with high demands on performance, reliability, and observability.
* Technical leadership with the ability to execute and deliver zero\\-to\\-one results amidst ambiguity.
* \\[bonus] Background in or experience working with machine learning and generative models.
