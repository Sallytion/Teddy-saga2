 InCommon is hiring on behalf of Podifi.
 



**Podifi** 
 is a product development company based in Palo Alto that helps startups and enterprises build full\\-stack applications through lean, AI\\-augmented teams. Their model blends product, design, and engineering to deliver outcomes—not just output. With their proprietary “Generative Agile” method, Podifi brings speed, clarity, and reliability to the software development process. Teams are structured for velocity and depth, with AI integrated across workflows to support documentation, coding, and decision\\-making—while keeping humans in control.
 



  





**About the Role** 




 We're hiring experienced backend engineers who can design and build high\\-performance systems in Go. You’ll work closely with product and infra teams to shape APIs, architect services, and solve real\\-world scaling problems. This isn’t just about writing Go — it’s about owning systems end\\-to\\-end, thinking in latency budgets, and keeping things simple even when it’s hard.
 



 If you’re someone who values clarity, concurrency, and clean interfaces — this might be your kind of team.
 



  





**What You'll Do** 



* Design and build backend services and APIs using Go
* Own large pieces of systems architecture — from shaping the model to rollout
* Write clean, testable, idiomatic Go code
* Profile, benchmark, and optimize performance bottlenecks
* Collaborate with product, design, infra, and frontend teams
* Contribute to code reviews, mentoring, and shaping technical culture



  





**What We Look For** 



* 3\\+ years of backend experience, with at least 2\\+ years in Go
* Strong grasp of concurrency, system design, and performance
* Ability to work across API, infra, and DB layers
* Familiarity with containers (Docker), cloud (GCP/AWS), and CI/CD workflows
* Prior experience with distributed systems or event\\-driven architectures is a plus
* Clear thinking, thoughtful abstractions, and a bias toward shipping



  





**Nice to Have** 



* Experience with PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, or similar
* Exposure to observability tools (Grafana, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)
* Open\\-source contributions or side projects in Go","Technology, Information and Media","https://www.linkedin.com/company/incommonhq","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQEMFFK2yVtWFg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1716288645557/incommonhq_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0WkqG_8PkZuocmHHYYYfdLIH72RNGmMrFlP0TiXYVh8","","","","","","","","","","",""
