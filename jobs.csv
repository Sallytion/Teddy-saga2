**About the role** 

  





 We are hiring a pragmatic, high\\-ownership Full\\-Stack Software Engineer to help build and scale a mission\\-critical healthcare integration platform. Today, we integrate with multiple dental practice management systems (PMS) and payer workflows to automate insurance eligibility, claims processing, and payment posting. Next, we will expand the same platform patterns into other medical PMS/EHR ecosystems.
 



  





 If you like real\\-world systems, messy integrations, and shipping value (not just debating architecture), you will fit right in.
 



  





  




**What you will do** 

  





**Integration engineering (core of the job)** 




  




* Maintain and extend integrations with multiple dental PMS platforms (and later medical PMS/EHRs)
* Sync patients, appointments, insurance plans, claims, and payments reliably across systems
* Troubleshoot vendor changes, inconsistent APIs, and legacy database quirks



  





**Payer automation and verification** 



* Build and maintain browser automation for insurance portals (eligibility checks, claim status, etc.)
* Handle MFA/OTP flows, session management, rate limiting, and UI changes that break scrapers
* Improve reliability in headless environments and production queue workflows



**Claims and revenue cycle workflows** 



* Implement claim scrubbing logic and rules\\-driven processing
* Extract data from EOBs and PDFs using OCR and document parsing
* Parse and validate EDI/X12 transactions (835/837\\) and reconcile posting into PMS systems



**Platform and product work** 



* Build and improve internal web UI for operations teams (work queues, status views, audit trails)
* Add new API endpoints, build migrations, improve observability, and support production operations
* Optimize SQL and performance for high\\-throughput, multi\\-tenant scenarios



  




**Tech stack (current)** 
* Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express
* Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind
* Database: PostgreSQL (including performance\\-focused SQL usage)
* Cloud: AWS services plus modern document/OCR tooling
* Automation: Puppeteer/Playwright\\-style browser automation and cloud browser orchestration
* AI: LLM\\-assisted workflows for structured extraction and claim intelligence



  




**What we are looking for (must\\-have)** 
* 4\\+ years building production systems in TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js backend)
* Strong SQL skills (joins, CTEs, performance tuning, data integrity thinking)
* Solid React experience (hooks, component architecture, state management)
* Experience integrating external systems and APIs (auth, retries, error handling)
* Web automation/scraping experience (Puppeteer, Playwright, or similar)
* Strong Git hygiene and comfort working in an existing codebase



  





  




**Strongly preferred** 
* Healthcare workflows familiarity (eligibility, claims, EOBs, payment posting)
* Experience with legacy system integration (older databases, vendor\\-specific quirks)
* OCR/document processing experience (PDFs, tables, extraction pipelines)
* Queue processing patterns (idempotency, retry logic, concurrency control)
* EDI/X12 experience (835/837\\)


**The mindset that wins here** 
* You can embrace complexity without panicking (some modules are big and integration\\-heavy)
* You know when to refactor vs patch (pragmatism beats perfection)
* You debug like a detective (across PMS, our platform, payer portals, and back)


**Why this is interesting** 
* Real business impact: your work directly reduces manual effort and increases collections
* Complex technical surface area: integrations, automation, OCR, EDI, multi\\-tenant scaling
* Clear roadmap: dental PMS expansion first, then broader medical PMS/EHR coverage
* Equity ownership in the company


**How to apply** 

**Send your LinkedIn profile \\+ a short note on:** 



* A hard integration you shipped
* A scraper/automation you made resilient
* A production bug you chased across multiple systems



  





**(And yes, you can include the story where the vendor changed their UI overnight. We have support group meetings for that.)** 



* **PS: This is a high\\-ownership, high\\-output environment. We move fast, ship continuously, and prioritize customer impact over comfort. If you want a role where you can switch off at 5pm every day, this won’t be a fit.
