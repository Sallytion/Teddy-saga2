 We are hiring for Java Software Engineer
 



 JD:
 



**Roles \\& Responsibilities** 



* Work as a Full Stack Software Engineer supporting two teams:
* Reporting \\& Interventions team
* Settings Platform team
* Both teams involve a combination of backend and frontend development.
* Support migration work from the existing architecture (separate Java backend and frontend stacks) to a server‑driven architecture.
* Contribute to iterative feature development on both platforms, including:
* Changes to reporting processes
* Interventions shown during login or account recovery
* Experience changes on the settings side
* Continue to support changes and iterations on the old architecture while migration is ongoing.
* Work across backend and frontend concerns, with flexibility depending on immediate team needs.



  





**Tools \\& Technical Skills** 



* Primary programming language: Java (core requirement).
* Kotlin:
* Considered a strong advantage
* Used in the new server‑driven architecture and Kotlin DSL
* No strict requirement on years of Kotlin experience
* Frontend technologies:
* No specific frontend framework is required (e.g., React, Swift, Objective‑C are not mandatory)
* Team is moving away from traditional native frontend development toward server‑driven UI using Kotlin
* Emphasis is on ability to learn and adapt, rather than experience in a specific frontend language.



  





**Day‑to‑Day Tasks** 



* Actively contribute to ongoing migration activities toward the new server‑driven architecture.
* Handle urgent, ad‑hoc requests for changes on existing systems.
* Develop and modify backend‑heavy functionality, with some frontend work handled through Kotlin DSL.
* Balance work between:
* Migration initiatives
* Enhancements and fixes on the current production stack



  





**Manager’s Expectations** 



* The candidate should be comfortable splitting effort between:
* Migration to the new architecture
* Ongoing development/support on the old architecture
* Strong Java fundamentals are critical; Kotlin familiarity is a plus but not a hard filter.
* Preference for engineers who can adapt quickly, learn new paradigms, and handle ambiguity during migration.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://www.linkedin.com/company/aditiconsulting","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQFhSuWL16cn7A/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1655498607143/aditiconsulting_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=It4-tJV5B__QI2CpigNjluWwi6a7TieFq3intjkuAoA","","","","","","","","","","",""
