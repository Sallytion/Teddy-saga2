You participate in activities that build capability across the organisation: coaching and mentoring of existing colleagues; and interviewing/hiring of new colleagues. Once you have reached the SDE3 level; progression will vary significantly; and is likely to include more lateral opportunities than vertical promotion.

I utilise this when facilitating design sessions to ensure that the system architecture evolves to support future requirements. I understand the wider Tesco architectural strategy and champion its application to the systems that I work on. At this level my job starts to become just as much about exercising technical judgment as it does about implementation. I am comfortable managing competing priorities and am able to bring order to ambiguous scenarios. I create optimal outcomes combining short\\-term and long\\-term goals; utilising data driven decision making techniques to take appropriate trade\\-offs. I can identify risks and proactively engage with product and programme managers. I am a strong communicator within my team and to my stakeholders.

 The Problem We're Solving
 



  





 Indian retail investors trade blind—no access to institutional\\-grade quant models, ownership pattern analysis, or stress\\-tested signals. They're stuck with basic screeners while institutions use sophisticated research systems.
 



 GreyOak is changing that.
 



 We've built a proprietary quant\\-driven equity intelligence platform that processes NSE stocks daily, combining multiple analytical layers—fundamentals, technicals, ownership patterns, and predictive models. All SEBI\\-aligned. All designed for Indian markets. All production\\-ready.

 ✅ Build \\& maintain core APIs (FastAPI \\+ PostgreSQL) for our analytical engines
 



 ✅ Integrate ML models into live inference pipelines
 



 ✅ Design data architecture with the founder and ML developer
 



 ✅ Own deployment (Docker, AWS, versioning, monitoring)
 



 ✅ Set engineering standards (code reviews, documentation, testing)
 



 12\\-month path: Part\\-time → Full\\-time → Head of Engineering (5\\-person team \\+ equity)

 Python 3\\.11 · FastAPI · Django · PostgreSQL · Redis · Docker · AWS
 



 LightGBM · Scikit\\-learn · Pandas · NumPy
 



  





 💰 Compensation \\& Growth
 



 Total Year 1 Potential: ₹5\\.8 Lakhs
 



  





 Base: ₹40,000/month (₹4\\.8L annually)
 



 Performance bonus: Up to ₹1,00,000/year (milestone \\& delivery based)
 



 Equity: 0\\.5–1% with 3\\-year vesting
 



  





 Growth path:
 



 Part\\-time (₹5\\.8L potential) → Full\\-time (₹15–18L \\+ increased equity) → Head of Engineering
 



  





 💡 You'll Thrive Here If You
 



  





 Have 4–6 years building backend systems with Python
 



 Have shipped APIs, microservices, or ML\\-driven apps to production
 



 Love fintech/quant systems and data\\-heavy logic
 



 Want to own systems end\\-to\\-end, not just write tickets
 



 Are energized by early\\-stage ambiguity and solving undefined problems
 



  





 Bonus: Experience with financial data, trading systems, or quant models
 



  





 🏁 Why Join GreyOak
 



 Work directly with a founder who: Is obsessed with Indian equity markets and has architected the core intelligence logic Ships fast, iterates daily, and prioritizes your input Values execution over credentials
 



  





 You'll get:
 



  





 High autonomy on technical decisions
 



 Meaningful work solving real problems for Indian investors
 



 Flexible remote schedule (evenings/weekends OK)
 



 Equity \\+ leadership opportunity as we scale

 Build fintech that actually matters for retail India
 



 Own technical decisions without corporate bureaucracy
 



 Join something early and grow into leadership
 



  





 This is it.
