Conventional QA approaches—even those incorporating rudimentary automation—consistently miss critical defects until it's too late, causing expensive delays and user dissatisfaction. Industry data reveals that more than 60% of software defects are detected after release, and quality issues cost the global software sector in excess of $2 trillion annually. The push for quicker, more dependable software demands a fundamental transformation in quality assurance strategy.
   

  

 IgniteTech is pioneering this transformation by embedding GenAI capabilities throughout the QA lifecycle. Through AI\\-powered simulation of user interactions, automated generation of sophisticated test scenarios, and intelligent analysis of defect patterns, we achieve accelerated releases with reduced bug counts. Becoming part of our team means positioning yourself at the cutting edge of innovation and leveraging AI to remove bottlenecks and anticipate issues before they materialize.
   

  

 This position differs significantly from conventional QA roles. If your expectation is a traditional setting focused on manual test case execution or maintaining repetitive automation scripts, this opportunity is not suitable for you. In this role, you will take ownership of building and advancing AI\\-powered test automation architectures, apply predictive analytics to surface latent risks, and contribute to defining the next generation of software quality practices. You will design scalable solutions that respond to the demands of contemporary development environments, rather than operating within a rigid, obsolete framework. If this aligns with the challenge you've been seeking, submit your application now to influence the future trajectory of software development.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Build and sustain AI\\-powered test automation frameworks that generate test cases, scripts, and datasets for thorough validation
* Leverage GenAI technologies to evaluate testing results, detect defect patterns, and deliver actionable recommendations for ongoing enhancement
* Create simulations of user interactions, load conditions, and boundary scenarios to detect potential problems before end\\-user impact


**Software Quality Assurance Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Apply AI and automation technologies to accelerate product delivery timelines and reduce product defect rates


**Basic Requirements**
* AI\\-First Mindset (if your default approach is to write code first and subsequently use AI tools to verify or enhance your code, rather than the other way around, then please do not apply)
* A minimum of 2 years of experience in a QA automation role
* Proficiency in Selenium and one of the following languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
* Professional experience using AI tools to automate QA workflows

* TimeBack: Educational platform that drives Alpha School's 2\\-hour learning model (99th percentile test results).
* Incept: Content generation platform producing all personalized educational content for multiple learning applications deployed at Alpha School.
* Crossover: AI\\-powered hiring platform handling tens of thousands of applicants per month, staffing schools and companies across the globe.


 You'll take ownership of one of these platforms and dedicate the majority of your time to building the most complex components of the codebase with a small team (3\\-5 strong engineers, no juniors). Your architectural choices dictate whether other teams can quickly build new applications, integrate seamlessly, and deliver value to students. Succeed here and you unlock massive leverage. Poor decisions generate integration chaos and destroy velocity across multiple teams.
   

  

 You design, build, and operate what you create. You define quality standards and patterns for your platform. We operate spec\\-driven: you design first, implement second, always plan before building. High autonomy, no committees, no review boards. Small tight\\-knit team, where you own what you ship.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Technical Leadership: Drive strategic architectural decisions and define technical patterns for the team to adopt.
* AI Leadership: Champion adoption of new AI workflows and develop high\\-impact playbooks.
* Implementation: Construct the complex, high\\-stakes components of the codebase with your team.
* Quality Reviews: Verify your team adheres to established patterns and upholds quality standards.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Serving as architect without writing code
* Spending time in endless meetings
* Managing people (this is a technical leadership position, not a people management role)
* Maintaining legacy systems or internal IT infrastructure


**Basic Requirements**
**Lead Software Engineer key responsibilities**
* At least 5 years of professional software development experience building software products
* At least 3 years as either a lead engineer (reviewing others' work) or architect (making key technical decisions)
* Experience working on platform\\-level products where other teams consumed your APIs
* Deep engagement with AI tools, actively experimenting and pushing boundaries
