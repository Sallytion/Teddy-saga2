 This position is within a project with one of the foundational LLM companies. The goal is to assist these foundational LLM companies in enhancing their Large Language Models.
 



 One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high\\-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine\\-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.
 



 For example, in the case of Agent Completion (AC) data generation, your task will be to simulate high\\-quality multi\\-turn conversations between a user and a smart assistant that utilizes function\\-calling tools to accomplish user goals. You will craft these dialogues by playing both the assistant and the user, while simulating tool use where necessary to guide the assistant through complex decision\\-making and real\\-world reasoning scenarios.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day look like:** 




  




* Design multi\\-turn conversations that simulate real interactions between users and AI assistants using apps like calendar, email, maps, and drive.
* Emulate both the user and the assistant, including the assistant's tool calls (only when corrections are needed).
* Carefully select when and how the assistant uses available tools, ensuring logical flow and proper usage of function calls.
* Craft dialogues that demonstrate natural language, intelligent behavior, and contextual understanding across multiple turns.
* Generate examples that showcase the assistant’s ability to gracefully complete feasible tasks, recognize infeasible ones, and maintain engaging general chat when tools aren’t required.
* Ensure all conversations adhere to defined formatting and quality guidelines, using an internal playbook.
* Iterate on conversation examples based on feedback to continuously improve realism, clarity, and value for training purposes.
* Collaborate with peers and reviewers to maintain consistency and high standards in deliverables.



  





**Requirements:** 




  




* 3\\+ years of overall professional experience in a technical or analytical field.
* Experience in
 **any programming language** 
 or
 **tech stack** 
 is acceptable; a strong grasp of APIs, data formats (e.g.,
 **JSON** 
 ), and logical thinking is more critical than specific toolsets.
* Strong general technical reasoning skills and the ability to model real\\-world assistant behavior using tool\\-based APIs.
* Ability to break down complex tasks and simulate realistic dialogues that reflect user expectations and assistant limitations.
* Excellent written communication skills in English, with a focus on clarity, tone, and instructional coherence.
* Creativity and attention to detail in crafting realistic scenarios and responses.
* Experience working with or around LLMs, virtual assistants, or function\\-calling frameworks is a plus.

**Role Summary** 




 We are seeking a Senior Platform Administrator to own our enterprise analytics ecosystem. You will manage everything from Terraform deployments to our emerging GenAI infrastructure. Beyond technical execution, you will serve as a strategic guardian against engineering inertia, enforcing a discipline of rational adaptability to ensure investments are driven by objective future value rather than past expenditures. This is a fully remote opportunity open to candidates across India.
 



  





**Principal Duties and Responsibilities** 



* Architect and maintain a multi\\-region Databricks on AWS environment, enforcing ""secure by default"" networking via customer\\-managed VPCs, PrivateLink, Transit Gateway, and strict IAM cross\\-account roles.
* Design the underlying infrastructure for Generative AI, including configuring MLflow for model governance, Databricks Vector Search for RAG applications, and GPU\\-optimized compute clusters for inference.
* Enforce reproducibility by managing all platform resources (workspaces, clusters, jobs) via Terraform and Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB), ensuring no manual changes exist in Production.
* Systematically audit legacy technical choices with a ""clean slate"" perspective. You are expected to seek disconfirming evidence that contradicts the status quo to prevent confirmation bias and the escalation of commitment to outdated strategies.
* Lead monthly FinOps reviews using AWS Cost Explorer and Databricks system tables to differentiate between necessary investment and sunk costs, ensuring we do not irrationally commit resources to failing projects.
* Own strategic vendor relationships (Databricks, AWS, Fivetran, Sigma), holding partners accountable for successful outcomes and resolving support blockers aggressively rather than passively accepting roadmap delays.
* Drive a Data Mesh culture by treating data assets as Data Products. Define clear contracts, SLOs (Service Level Objectives), and publication standards to decouple producers from consumers.
* Design and operationalize data privacy frameworks to satisfy GDPR, CCPA, PDPB (India), and SOC2 requirements, including automated workflows for Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF) requests and PII masking within the Lakehouse architecture.
* Administer the Sigma Computing environment, overseeing workspace architecture, version tagging strategies, and the promotion path of analytics assets from Dev to Production.
* Design and enforce comprehensive Role\\-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies across Unity Catalog (Catalogs, Schemas, Tables) and AWS IAM, ensuring least privilege access while maintaining operational velocity.
* Manage high\\-volume data replication pipelines using Fivetran and AWS DMS, ensuring data fidelity, efficient schema drift handling, and cost\\-optimized sync frequencies across heterogeneous sources.
* Perform rigorous code reviews on high\\-impact pipelines, enforcing best practices such as Z\\-ordering, Liquid Clustering, and Schema Evolution, with the authority to reject sub\\-standard code.
* Partner with analytics, data science, and business teams to design scalable data solutions that align to strategic priorities and unlock advanced use cases.
* Drive innovation by introducing emerging technologies, frameworks, and best practices into engineering workflows to improve scalability, automation, and productivity.
* Collaborate effectively in a fully remote setting, maintaining clear asynchronous communication, documentation standards, and virtual team engagement across time zones.



  





**Qualifications and Key Skills** 



* 8\\+ years in Data Engineering/Architecture, with 3\\+ years of daily production mastery in Databricks on AWS.
* Deep familiarity with global and Indian data compliance standards (GDPR, CCPA, PDPB/DPDP Act) and experience implementing technical controls for PII protection (e.g., dynamic views, column\\-level encryption) in a distributed data environment.
* Expert\\-level proficiency with modern ELT and BI tools, specifically Fivetran (connector configuration, transformation), AWS DMS, and Sigma Computing (administration, version control, security).
* Deep understanding of Role\\-Based Access Control (RBAC) models within distributed data systems, specifically regarding Unity Catalog grants and AWS IAM Identity Center.
* Deep expertise in AWS networking (Transit Gateway, VPC Endpoints, Private Subnets) and security (SCPs, Encryption, IAM identity center).
* Proven production experience deploying CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions and Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB).
* Demonstrated experience managing enterprise software vendors, including contract utilization, technical escalation, and roadmap alignment.
* A track record of making high\\-stakes technical decisions, including examples of when you recommended stopping a project to save resources (managing Sunk Cost bias).
* Databricks Certified Data Engineer Professional (strongly preferred) or AWS Solutions Architect Professional.
* Familiarity with Generative AI concepts and modern ML techniques (LLMs, transformers, ensemble methods, deep learning frameworks) and how they integrate into data engineering workflows.
* Strong analytical problem\\-solving mindset, capable of identifying patterns, optimizing processes, and unlocking new business value through scalable solutions.
* Demonstrated ability to navigate ambiguity—driving clarity, alignment, and momentum in evolving requirements and complex stakeholder landscapes.
* Working knowledge of agile/scrum methodologies and use of agile lifecycle management tools (e.g., Jira, Confluence).
* Exceptional communication and leadership skills to mentor engineers, influence stakeholders, and drive adoption of data products and practices.
* Comfort working in a fully remote environment with self\\-discipline, strong documentation habits, and effective virtual collaboration skills.
