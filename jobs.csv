* Innovate with AI \\+ Automation: Work with platform and AI teams to bring intelligent, agent\\-driven capabilities into the front end and improve developer workflows.
* Champion Quality and Best Practices: Write well\\-tested code, participate in code reviews, and help elevate engineering standards within the team.

* Solid CS Fundamentals: Good understanding of algorithms, design patterns, and modern application architecture.
* AI Awareness: Experience using AI tools to enhance development productivity and willingness to learn emerging AI\\-driven patterns.


 Maybe you don’t tick all the boxes above—but still think you’d be great for the job? Go ahead, apply anyway. Please. Because we know that experience comes in all shapes and sizes—and passion can’t be learned.

* Do you want to keep learning and developing whilst getting hands\\-on experience working in the payments space?
* Do you want to have the opportunity to apply technology to transform the way we operate at scale.


 If so, we would love to hear from you!
   

  

 We are looking to hire ambitious, and value\\-adding talent to join Modulr, the fastest growing payments business in the UK and Europe. The Principal Engineer is a hands\\-on individual contributor role with broad technical influence across multiple teams within our Engineering, CTO team. In this role you will work in a cross\\-functional team who are asked to solve a problem, rather than be handed a task to do. This is an excellent opportunity to work in a high\\-growth environment with a fast\\-paced and collaborative culture where you will have great opportunities to work on challenging problems.
   

  

**About Us**
 At Modulr our mission is to move money efficiently to power business productivity. We are building a new digital payments service to make money flow more efficiently through businesses and the economy. This is a new type of payments account that is built for businesses that need faster, easier and more reliable ways to move money.
   

  

 Our flexible platform and innovative approach allows our customers to utilise our payments account instead of a traditional bank account. Our accounts come with a sort code and account number, access to payment systems (eg Faster Payments and Visa) and everything our customers need from a payments account. They can instantly open as many accounts as they need, automate how they make and receive payments as well as the reconciliation processes these create. All in real time, 24/7 through their own systems utilising our API that integrates into any platform.
   

  

 Our founding team has a wealth of experience in the payments industry and growing successful businesses. Modulr is backed by payments giants PayPal Ventures and FIS Ventures, as well as startup and scale up specialists Blenheim Chalcot, General Atlantic, Frog and Highland Europe which enables us to leverage their resources and expertise to drive our growth initiatives. These partnerships provide us with the necessary provisions to propel our business to new heights.
   

  

**Modulr values**
* Building the extraordinary and going that extra mile
* Owning the opportunity, be passionate and proud of the time you invest
* Move at pace, reach your goals faster with us supporting you each step of the way
* Achieve it together, working as a team and being a Modulite


**The Tech Team**
 At Modulr we are focused on building autonomous squads that are focused on working in the best possible way. We operate in a tribes and squad model with each area focused on a particular growth area. Each squad is small and cross\\-functional. We have big ambitions and have many interesting challenges ahead. Our strategy is to provide our customers with seamless connectivity into payment schemes both domestically and overseas no matter where they're based.
   

  

**About The Role**
* Lead in Design, analysis and documentation of products, systems or subsystems, setting the technical direction for key parts of the platform.
* Provide hands\\-on technical leadership on the most complex areas of the platform, pairing with teams and unblocking hard engineering problems and raising the quality bar.
* Take principal ownership of core framework components such as the workflow engine, rules/decision engine and event\\-driven orchestration layer, defining patterns and abstractions that other teams reuse.
* Design and evolve event\\-driven architectures that support real\\-time decisioning, auditability and replay across multiple domains.
* Lead the design and implementation of agentic AI–driven workflows, orchestrating services and AI components to assist human operators while keeping decisions explainable and controlled.
* Define and own domain models, service boundaries and integration contracts, using techniques like domain\\-driven design and hexagonal architecture to keep systems loosely coupled and vendor\\-agnostic.
* Drive engineering standards, tooling, and processes to the next level – from code quality and testing through to observability, reliability and security.
* Develop and execute test procedures for software.
* Proactively identify issues, bottlenecks, gaps, or other areas of concerns or opportunities and work to either directly affect change, or advocate for that change.
* Work in an agile environment \\- Scrum or Kanban.
* Document best practices, guides, systems design, reference architectures and implementations.
* Participate in design and code reviews.
* Contribute to the evolution of our architecture to make it more flexible and easier to use.
* Be an ambassador for technical excellence both within Modulr and externally by representing Modulr in events and conferences.

* You are a self\\-starter, motivated team player who thrives in a fast\\-paced environment
* You enjoy shaping architecture as well as code – guiding service boundaries, contracts, writing complex frameworks and event models that other teams build on.
* You have a strong track record of building high\\-scale, reliable systems, and you are comfortable designing for resilience, observability and graceful degradation from day one.
* You are comfortable in building event\\-driven and data\\-driven platforms.
* You are curious/passionate about AI and automation and think carefully about where agents/LLMs add real value while staying within risk and control boundaries.
