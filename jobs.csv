 If you’re passionate about deep platform and infrastructure engineering, solving complex scaling challenges, and enabling teams through elegant, automated solutions—this role is for you.
 

  
 




**About the Team**

  
 





 Our Cloud Compute Platform
 


 Engineering team is at the heart of Roku’s transformation toward a single, unified platform. We design and scale Kubernetes clusters, service mesh architecture, and supporting systems to ensure all engineering teams speak the same infrastructure language. We partner with internal teams to migrate workloads, enhance CI/CD pipelines, and integrate observability and security into every layer of the stack. Collaboration and impact are core to what we do.
 

  
 




**What You’ll Be Doing**

  
 



* Architect, design, and deploy Roku’s next\\-generation cloud platform and service mesh.

**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

**About The Role**
****Job Title:****
 Subject Matter Expert (Deep Connected Platform)
   

  

****Experience****
 : 10 \\- 15 years
   

  

****Job Type****
 : Full\\-Time
   

  

 Sibros is accelerating the shift to software‑defined mobility with its Deep Connected Platform® (DCP)—an end‑to‑end, vehicle‑to‑cloud stack for OTA software updates, deep data logging, and safe remote commands. As the Subject Matter Expert (SME) for DCP, you’ll be the go‑to authority who helps OEMs and mobility customers design, integrate, and scale Sibros solutions across complex vehicle architectures. You’ll partner with Product, Solutions Engineering, Customer Success, and Sales to translate real‑world business and regulatory needs into robust technical designs using DCP’s core modules (Deep Updater, Deep Logger, Deep Commander).
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Lead technical discovery and solution design with OEM and fleet engineering teams; define end‑to‑end vehicle‑to‑cloud architectures using DCP for OTA, data logging, diagnostics, and safe remote commands.
* Own OTA strategy and safety: design campaign orchestration, staging/rollout, rollback and recovery, bootloader and partitioning strategies, and update dependencies across ECU networks using Deep Updater.
* Define data strategies with Deep Logger: specify signals, triggers, sampling rates, and retention; balance bandwidth, cost, and fidelity; enable fleet‑scale analytics and engineering workflows.
* Operationalize remote commands with Deep Commander: model command catalogs, guardrails, permissions, and auditability for field operations, diagnostics, and service use cases.
* Map solutions to regulations and standards: guide customers on meeting WP.29/UNECE R155 (cybersecurity) and R156 (software updates) obligations and prepare artifacts for CSMS/SUMS audits.
* Run POCs and pilots: plan success criteria, lead integrations on gateway/telematics ECUs, and de‑risk production rollouts with measurable outcomes and handover plans.
* Create enablement: author reference architectures, playbooks, and best practices; deliver workshops for internal teams, partners, and customers.
* Be the field’s voice into Product: synthesize feedback from deployments; influence roadmaps for reliability, diagnostics depth, observability, and developer experience.
* Support go‑to‑market: contribute to RFPs/SOWs, quantify value (quality, uptime, warranty, and TCO impact), and present technical material to senior engineering and compliance stakeholders.
* Champion interoperability: advise on integrations with customer clouds and partner ecosystems (e.g., Azure/GCP), data lakes, and enterprise systems.


**What You Should Know**
* 10\\+ years in automotive or embedded connectivity, including 3\\+ years designing OTA, telematics, or connected‑vehicle platforms at OEMs, Tier‑1s, or mobility fleets.
* Deep familiarity with vehicle networking \\& diagnostics: CAN/CAN‑FD, automotive Ethernet, SOME/IP; diagnostics protocols (UDS, DoIP, ISO‑TP) and their practical use in update and logging flows.
* Handson knowledge of OTA safety and reliability: fail‑safe/rollback patterns, secure boot/bootloaders, package signing, campaign gating, and ECU dependency management.
* Experience mapping systems to UNECE R155/R156 and preparing CSMS/SUMS evidence; working knowledge of ISO/SAE 21434 and ISO 24089 concepts.
* Cloud \\& data fluency: designing data pipelines (streaming \\& batch), data governance/retention, API design, observability, and secure device‑to‑cloud comms.
* Tooling: Vector/CANoe, Wireshark, protocol analyzers; issue tracking and documentation tools.
* Excellent communication—able to whiteboard complex ideas with architects one day and brief executives the next; comfortable with customer‑facing roles and light travel.


**Perks Of Joining The Sibros Team**
* You will work with an awesome team where work culture is built to help you grow and have sense of full responsibility and accountability on a daily basis
* You will have opportunities to work with industry veterans and high profile OEM customers in the connected vehicle technology space
* Competitive and generous total compensation package
* Flexible vacation and paid time off. You’re the best person to decide when you need time off. Our flexible vacation policy puts you in control.
* Team events and off\\-sites.
* Budget for online courses, books, and conferences.
* Employee wellness programs to support self\\-care and overall wellness.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/sibros","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHee3mRbFvJKw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630641686085/sibros_tech_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=79dOK6kUigPQmaBozpt4d5m8oFV-yqlGsgudprhwZiU","","","","","","","","","","",""

**Who You Are**
 As a Mainframe DB2 System Programmer SME at Kyndryl are project\\-based subject matter experts in all things infrastructure – good at providing analysis, documenting and diagraming work for hand\\-off, offering timely solutions, and generally “figuring it out.” This is a hands\\-on role where your feel for the interaction between a system and its environment will be invaluable to every one of your clients.
   

  

 There are two halves to this role: First, contributing to current projects where you analyze problems and tech issues, offer solutions, and test, modify, automate, and integrate systems. And second, long\\-range strategic planning of IT infrastructure and operational execution. This role isn’t specific to any one platform, so you’ll need a good feel for all of them. And because of this, you’ll experience variety and growth at Kyndryl that you won’t find anywhere else.
   

  

 You’ll be involved early to offer solutions, help decide whether something can be done, and identify the technical and timeline risks up front. This means dealing with both client expectations and internal challenges – in other words, there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference, and a lot of people will witness your contributions. In fact, a frequent sign of success for our Infrastructure Specialists is when clients come back to us and ask for the same person by name. That’s the kind of impact you can have!
   

  

 This is a project\\-based role where you’ll enjoy deep involvement throughout the lifespan of a project, as well as the chance to work closely with Architects, Technicians, and PMs. Whatever your current level of tech savvy or where you want your career to lead, you’ll find the right opportunities and a buddy to support your growth. Boredom? Trust us, that won’t be an issue.
   

  

**Your future at Kyndryl**
 There are lots of opportunities to gain certification and qualifications on the job, and you’ll continuously grow as a Cloud Hyperscaler. Many of our Infrastructure Specialists are on a path toward becoming either an Architect or Distinguished Engineer, and there are opportunities at every skill level to grow in either of these directions.
