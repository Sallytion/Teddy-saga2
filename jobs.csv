**Company:** 
 Markopolo AI Inc.
 



**Experience:** 
 1–3 years
 



**Type:** 
 Full\\-Time (40 hours/week)
 



**Location:** 
 Remote / Hybrid — Bangalore (India) or Dhaka (Bangladesh)
 



**Hybrid Policy:** 
 2 days in office, 3 days work from home
 



**Reports To:** 
 Engineering Lead / SWE II
 



  





**ABOUT THE ROLE** 




 Markopolo AI (markopolo.ai) is building the behavioral intelligence layer for the internet. Our flagship model, ATHENA—a 709M\\-parameter behavioral foundation model—predicts what users will do 10–30 seconds before they act. Trained on 40M\\+ behavioral sequences across 603 independent businesses, ATHENA achieves 72\\.67% Top\\-1 accuracy on 116\\-class next\\-event prediction and runs at 0\\.01 ms inference latency via extreme compression (709M parameters → 50KB WebAssembly). We are the “Stripe for behavior”: foundational infrastructure powering real\\-time personalization, cart recovery, fraud detection, and the coming wave of agent\\-to\\-agent commerce. We are a small, intense team building something the world hasn’t seen before.
 



  





 We’re venture\\-backed by HF0 (investors in Ramp, Pave, Fabric, Clerk), Joa Capital (Saudi Sovereign Fund’s arm), and are headquartered in San Francisco, USA, with offices in Dhaka, Bangalore, and Riyadh.
 



  





 As a Software Engineer I, you will work across ATHENA’s full stack—from the browser\\-side SDK to the backend prediction pipeline. You’ll ship features, fix real production issues, and learn how behavioral AI systems operate at scale. We move fast, we deploy daily, and every engineer’s code touches real users from day one. If you’re early in your career but build with intensity and curiosity, this is the role for you.
 



  





**WHAT YOU'LL DO** 



* Build and maintain features across the Athena tracker SDK, API layer, and data pipeline.
* Write clean, tested, production\\-grade code in Python and/or TypeScript.
* Implement and iterate on integrations with third\\-party platforms (Shopify, commerce APIs, n8n workflows).
* Assist in building and testing streaming data infrastructure (event ingestion, processing, storage).
* Debug and resolve production incidents with guidance from senior engineers.
* Write unit/integration tests and contribute to CI/CD pipeline improvements.
* Participate in code reviews, sprint planning, and technical discussions.
* Document your work clearly — we value engineers who write well.



  





**REQUIREMENTS** 



* 1–3 years of professional or significant project\\-based software engineering experience.
* Proficiency in Python and/or TypeScript/JavaScript.
* Understanding of web fundamentals: HTTP, REST APIs, browser events, DOM.
* Familiarity with at least one database (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, MongoDB, or similar).
* Comfort with Git, CI/CD basics, and working in a collaborative engineering team.
* Strong problem\\-solving skills and a bias toward shipping working software.
* Good written communication skills.



  





**NICE TO HAVE** 



* Experience with real\\-time or event\\-driven systems.
* Familiarity with Docker, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP), or serverless deployments.
* Interest or coursework in machine learning, data engineering, or edge computing.
* Contributions to open\\-source projects or a strong personal project portfolio.



  





**WHY MARKOPOLO** 



* Work on a 709M\\-parameter behavioral foundation model (ATHENA) that predicts human actions before they happen — real frontier AI, not wrapper products.
* Remote\\-first culture with hybrid flexibility (2 days in office, 3 days Work from home).
* Competitive compensation with equity options for full\\-time roles.
* Learn from a team pushing the boundaries of edge AI, model compression, and real\\-time behavioral intelligence.



  





**HOW TO APPLY—WHAT WE WANT TO SEE** 




 We don’t care about your GPA. We care about what you’ve built. Your application must include:
 



  





**🚀 Your Most Impressive Vibe\\-Coded Project** 




 Share a link to a GitHub/GitLab repository of the most impressive project you’ve built using vibe coding (AI\\-assisted development with tools like Cursor, Copilot, Claude, v0, Replit Agent, etc.). This can be:
 


* A side project, hackathon submission, freelance project, or personal tool.
* Any language, any stack, any domain. We’re looking for ambition, creativity, and execution quality.
* Include a README that explains what it does, what AI tools you used, what you learned, and what you’d improve.



  





*We want to see that you can leverage modern AI tools to build real software fast. Engineers who can “vibe code” effectively multiply their output 5–10x — that’s the kind of builder we want on the team.* 




  





**Ready to build the future of behavioral intelligence?**

 As a Software Engineer II, you will own and ship core systems that directly power ATHENA’s prediction pipeline, edge deployment infrastructure, and enterprise integrations. You won’t just write features—you'll design systems that operate at sub\\-millisecond latency, handle millions of concurrent sessions, and compress state\\-of\\-the\\-art models into packages smaller than a JPEG. This role is for engineers who build things they’re proud of and want to work at the frontier of applied AI.

* Experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Modal) and containerized deployments (Docker, Kubernetes).
