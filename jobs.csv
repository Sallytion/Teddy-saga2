 Chennai, India
 **Experience:** 
 5 – 10 Years
 **Education:** 
 B.E. / B.Tech / M.E. / M.Sc. / MCA
 **Employment Type:** 
 Full\\-time
   

  

**Job Summary**
 We are looking for a seasoned Data Engineer with 5 to 10 years of experience to lead our migration initiative in
 **Chennai** 
 . The ideal candidate is an expert in the traditional Informatica stack (PowerCenter, IDQ, MDM) but is looking to pivot their career toward the Cloud.
   

  

 You will be responsible for migrating critical data workflows to
 **Informatica Intelligent Data Management Cloud (IDMC)** 
 . This role requires high adaptability: you must be able to analyze complex legacy IDQ mappings and re\\-architect them using
 **Cloud Data Integration (CDI)** 
 components.
   

  

****Key Responsibilities****
* Migration Strategy \\& Execution: Lead the end\\-to\\-end migration of ETL processes from PowerCenter to IDMC SaaS.
* IDQ to CDI Conversion: Analyze existing on\\-premise Data Quality rules and re\\-implement them using Cloud Data Integration (CDI) and Cloud Data Quality (CDQ) logic.
* Master Data Management (MDM): Configure and maintain MDM solutions; ensure ""Golden Record"" integrity is maintained during the SaaS transition.
* Advanced SQL Development: Write complex SQL queries, stored procedures, and views for data validation, logic implementation, and performance tuning.
* Report Generation: Design and generate data quality dashboards, audit reports, and operational metrics reports for stakeholders (using SQL or BI tools).
* Technical Leadership: Mentor junior developers and act as the point of contact for resolving technical blockers during the migration.


****Primary Skills (Must Have)****
* Informatica PowerCenter: Expert\\-level proficiency (5\\+ years) in creating complex mappings, mapplets, and workflows.
* Informatica Data Quality (IDQ): Strong hands\\-on experience with IDQ Analyst/Developer tools (parsing, standardization, address validation, and matching strategies).
* Database \\& SQL: Expert\\-level SQL skills. Ability to write complex joins, analyze query performance, and troubleshoot data issues directly in the database (Oracle/SQL Server/Snowflake).
* Report Generation: Experience in generating operational reports and data quality scorecards. Familiarity with extracting data for reporting tools (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI, or SSRS) is a plus.
* MDM Knowledge: Solid understanding of MDM architecture, landing tables, staging, base objects, and match/merge rules.


****The ""Learning Curve"" (Critical Requirement)****
* Cloud Agility: While we value your on\\-premise expertise, you must be willing and able to learn IDMC quickly.
* Logic Translation: You will be tested on your ability to take a legacy concept (e.g., an IDQ ""Standardizer"" transformation) and determine how to achieve the same result using IDMC CDI assets if a direct equivalent doesn't exist.
* Self\\-Starter: Ability to read documentation, experiment with the SaaS interface, and drive the migration without needing constant supervision.


****Preferred Qualifications****
* Experience with IICS (Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services) is a major advantage.
* Knowledge of Scripting (Unix/Python) for automation.
* Background in data governance or data stewardship.


**Responsibilities**
****Key Responsibilities****
* SaaS Migration: Lead the technical migration of ETL and Data Quality assets from PowerCenter/IDQ to the IDMC SaaS platform.
* Mapping Conversion: Analyze legacy IDQ rules and re\\-engineer them to function efficiently using IDMC Cloud Data Integration (CDI) components.
* SQL \\& Reporting: Develop complex SQL queries for data validation and generate detailed Data Quality/Audit reports for stakeholders.
* MDM Support: Manage Master Data Management processes (Match \\& Merge, Trust Scores) to ensure data integrity during the transition.
* Testing: Conduct rigorous unit testing to ensure cloud workflows match on\\-premise performance.


**Qualifications**
**QUALIFICATIONS**
* Experience: 5\\+ years of hands\\-on experience with Informatica PowerCenter, IDQ, and MDM.
* Technical Skills: Expert\\-level proficiency in SQL (Oracle/SQL Server) and experience generating operational reports.
* Learning Curve: Demonstrated ability to learn new technologies quickly; prior exposure to IICS/IDMC is a plus, but the ability to translate legacy logic to the cloud is mandatory.
* Education: Engineering Graduate, ME, MCA, or MSc in a related field.","Motor Vehicle Manufacturing","https://www.linkedin.com/company/ford-motor-company","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEyJKJoABrJhA/company-logo_100_100/B4EZkze0eEHIAQ-/0/1757505341977/ford_motor_company_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WxpZQKa7Bum9lMyjmjBdzjf6ghUqK-nPyHXBGrS56sI","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud\\-native by design, the Lookout platform offers rapid, scalable deployment and simplified security operations, defending the frontline of human\\-centric attacks—the mobile device. Attackers now target the human element more than ever, with mobile devices providing the most direct path to their victims. Using social engineering techniques that exploit basic human instincts like trust, curiosity, and urgency, they deceive users into revealing sensitive credentials, allowing them to slip past legacy security solutions.
   

  

 Lookout Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) continuously monitors mobile endpoints for signs of human\\-centric attacks, as well as traditional malware, software vulnerabilities, and other anomalous activity. It uses advanced threat detection techniques, including artificial intelligence (AI) and behavioral analysis, to identify threats before they escalate across the enterprise. Learn more at www.lookout.com and follow us on the Lookout Blog, LinkedIn, and X.
