We are proud to have the support of the best investors in the game who believe in our mission, solutions and people. Ready to tackle global challenges that impact business, society, and the environment? Come join us.
   

  

**The opportunity:**
 Investing your time with Flexport means keeping pace with a rapidly growing business, learning new skills, and seeking opportunities to fill the gap. We appreciate your contributions to making Flexport an amazing place to work and we encourage upwards or lateral movement and transfers that align with current business needs.
   

  

 Exceptional software development is integral in allowing us to fulfil our mission of making global trade easier for everyone.

 Want to tackle global challenges that have an impact on business, society, and the environment? Come join us.
   

  

**Worried about not having any logistics experience?**
* Don’t be! We’re building the first Operating System for Global Trade. That’s why it’s incredibly important for us to bring people from diverse backgrounds and experiences together with our industry veterans to help move the freight forwarding industry forward.
* What’s freight forwarding and why does it matter? Freight forwarding is the coordination and shipment of goods from one place to another and it’s what makes global trade possible. Flexport is on a mission to make global trade easier for everyone because we believe it can help connect the world and break down economic barriers.
* We know this industry is complex. That’s why we invest in education starting day one with Flexport Academy, a one\\-week intensive onboarding program designed specifically to set every new Flexport employee up for success.

 **The Mission** 




 You will be the ""Logic Auditor"" of our engineering team. Your primary responsibility is to design and execute rigorous evaluation frameworks to verify the correctness and performance of complex software algorithms. You will ensure that every algorithm we deploy—from data sorting to complex network traversals—meets the highest standards of Big O efficiency and numerical accuracy.
 



**Key Responsibilities** 



* **Algorithmic Benchmarking:** 
 Develop automated frameworks to measure time and space complexity across various edge cases and dataset scales.
* **Correctness Validation:** 
 Implement formal verification and unit tests to ensure algorithms produce expected outputs for every possible input permutation.
* **Performance Profiling:** 
 Identify computational bottlenecks using profiling tools (e.g., cProfile, Valgrind) and recommend optimizations to improve execution speed.
* **Big O Analysis:** 
 Conduct theoretical audits of proposed logic to determine asymptotic behavior ($O(n)$, $O(n \\\\log n)$, etc.) before implementation.
* **Comparative Evaluation:** 
 Build ""A/B Testing"" harnesses to compare the efficacy of different algorithmic approaches (e.g., Greedy vs. Dynamic Programming) for specific business problems.
* **Data Pipeline Integration:** 
 Ensure that algorithm evaluation is a standard stage in our CI/CD pipelines, preventing ""performance regressions"" in new code releases.



**Required Technical Skills** 



* **Core Logic:** 
 Mastery of
 **Data Structures** 
 (Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Maps) and
 **Algorithms** 
 (Sorting, Searching, Shortest Path).
* **Programming:** 
 Strong proficiency in
 **Python** 
 (for scripting/automation) and
 **C\\+\\+** 
 (for performance\\-critical profiling).
* **Math Foundation:** 
 Solid grasp of
 **Discrete Mathematics** 
 , Probability, and Linear Algebra.
* **Testing Frameworks:** 
 Experience with PyTest, Google Test, or similar suites for automated validation.
* **DevOps/MLOps:** 
 Familiarity with
 **Docker** 
 and CI/CD tools (Jenkins/GitHub Actions) to automate performance benchmarking.
* **Profiling Tools:** 
 Hands\\-on experience with memory and CPU profilers.



**Soft Skills** 



* **Meticulous Attention to Detail:** 
 You enjoy finding the ""one\\-in\\-a\\-million"" edge case that breaks a sorting logic.
* **Analytical Skepticism:** 
 You don't take ""it works on my machine"" as an answer; you want to see the performance curve.
* **Clear Communication:** 
 The ability to translate complex mathematical failures into actionable bug reports for the development team.
