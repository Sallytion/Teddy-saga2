 Whatfix is an AI platform advancing the “userization” of enterprise applications, empowering companies to maximize the ROI of their digital investments. Technology needs adoption. It’s no different for AI. As AI reshapes roles, workflows, and human\\-machine interactions, it also introduces new layers of complexity and user friction. This is where Whatfix plays a pivotal role. A decade old DNA of empowering people to succeed with technology and not replacing them. We call this philosophy
 **Userization** 
 : the belief that technology must adapt to the user, not the other way around.
 



  





 At the heart of userization philosophy is
 **ScreenSense** 
 , our proprietary AI engine, which continuously interprets both the context of what users are doing in an application or an AI tool and the intent behind their actions. By combining these signals, Whatfix delivers real\\-time guidance, nudges, knowledge, and automation directly in the flow of work.
 



  





 This intelligence powers our entire product suite.
 


* **Digital Adoption** 
 helps users get productive faster.
* **Product Analytics**

 is an AI\\-native assistant that not only knows your business context but can also act across applications to get work done on your behalf.
* **Whatfix Mirror 2\\.0** 
 is the world’s only System plus Role simulation with a complete assessment to lead the Gen AI simulation category.



  





 Together, these products reflect Whatfix’s commitment to building enterprise\\-ready AI teammates that maximize productivity and ROI. It gives users a unified, intelligent way to find answers across systems, apps, and knowledge silos and helps anyone looking to deliver fast and contextual answers.
 



  





 Whatfix is bridging the gap between rapid technological change and human enablement—ensuring AI is not only embedded but also usable, trusted, and outcome\\-driven for every employee.
 



  





 At Whatfix, we’re not just making software easier—we’re making AI work for people.

 As a Software Development Engineer 3 you are in a senior Individual Contributor engineering role at Tesco. Your proficiency with foundational computer science and software engineering concepts is taken as a given, and you will have proven significant technical depth and breadth. At this level you will be playing an active role in technical leadership, with proven impact across teams and the wider directorate. You take ownership and accountability of the development of the products in your domain. You participate in activities that build capability across the organisation: coaching and mentoring of existing colleagues, and interviewing/hiring of new colleagues. Once you have reached the SDE3 level, progression will vary significantly, and is likely to include more lateral opportunities than vertical promotion. This is also the level of core technical knowledge you must reach before considering a sideways move to the management track.
   

**You will be responsible for**
 My impact reaches beyond my immediate team, and I provide perspective and context for technology choices across my directorate. The work that I do has foundational impact across teams in my area and the directorate that I am a member of. I am a technical leader for my teams and others will regularly come to me for mentorship and support. I am comfortable both supporting other engineers in their delivery and taking the lead on key features as appropriate. I have delivered multiple projects that move the needle for the business. I have demonstrated technical breadth and depth; I am an expert in my domain.
   

  

 At this level I display a high degree of ownership for the work conducted by the team. I am accountable for the quality of every result, produced by individuals and teams. I am an advocate of best practices across my directorate. I build maturity in the way we develop, deliver and operate services. I ensure that we’re learning from the best in the industry, designing and implementing appropriate testing and deployment strategies.
   

  

 I can anticipate feature evolution of my product. I utilise this when facilitating design sessions to ensure that the system architecture evolves to support future requirements. I understand the wider Tesco architectural strategy and champion its application to the systems that I work on. At this level my job starts to become just as much about exercising technical judgment as it does about implementation.
   

  

 I am comfortable managing competing priorities and am able to bring order to ambiguous scenarios. I create optimal outcomes combining short\\-term and long\\-term goals, utilising data driven decision making techniques to take appropriate trade\\-offs. I can identify risks and proactively engage with product and programme managers. I am a strong communicator within my team and to my stakeholders.
   

  

 I am a trusted mentor, a role\\-model for more junior engineers. I am approachable and am frequently asked to mentor those around me. I prioritise sharing skills and technical knowledge across the directorate, both informally in 1:1 discussions and by arranging more formal training opportunities.

These priorities directly impact product time\\-to\\-market and customer satisfaction. Historically, software deployment timelines have suffered under conventional coding methodologies, with approximately 30% of projects running over schedule due to preventable inefficiencies and errors.
   

  

 IgniteTech is spearheading this shift by embedding advanced GenAI capabilities into the core of software architecture and development workflows. This position diverges from conventional roles centered on gradual optimization. Instead, it provides a unique opportunity to spearhead transformative AI\\-led initiatives. You will drive the integration of AI not simply to improve, but to fundamentally reshape how software is developed, delivering substantial gains in efficiency and strategic competitiveness.
   

  

 This role is tailored for professionals committed to operating at the technological vanguard. It is not an execution\\-focused or task\\-driven assignment; rather, it is a strategic function involving deep research and development, rapid prototyping, and pioneering AI applications in next\\-generation software creation. The ideal candidate combines expertise in AI and software architecture with a forward\\-thinking mindset oriented toward leveraging technology for business transformation.
   

  

 You will guide our team in defining the architectural blueprints and integration strategies that embed AI into our software platforms. Your contributions will be central to our mission, directly shaping the productivity and quality of what we deliver. We welcome you to apply if you are committed to expanding the frontiers of technology and eager to drive measurable impact within the software industry.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Architect comprehensive frameworks for AI\\-powered systems that automate sophisticated software development activities, including architecture generation, dependency orchestration, and advanced predictive coding capabilities.
* Engage deeply with emerging trends in AI and software engineering through R\\&D programs, conference participation, and active involvement in academic and professional networks. Our goal is to be among the earliest adopters when breakthrough AI technologies emerge.


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Routine Code Maintenance: Performing regular updates or debugging of existing codebases to address minor defects or incremental functionality improvements.
* Standard Software Development: Executing basic coding tasks or developing straightforward features that do not involve AI\\-driven methodologies or integration.


**Lead AI Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Apply your engineering acumen to deliver measurable improvements in development velocity, error reduction, and code quality, driving faster software product launches and elevated customer satisfaction.


**Basic Requirements**
* A minimum of 3 years of professional experience as a full\\-stack software developer (proficiency in both front\\-end and back\\-end coding is mandatory)
* Extensive hands\\-on experience with GenAI code assistants (e.g., Github Copilot, Cursor.sh, v0\\.dev)
* Proven track record of successfully delivering Generative AI products/projects/solutions/tools
* Demonstrated experience utilizing various LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, Mistral) to address business challenges
* Clear understanding of the criteria and rationale for selecting specific LLM models for distinct use cases
* Confirmed knowledge and practical application of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
