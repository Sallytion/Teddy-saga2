 Location: Remote
 





 Reports to: Founder, Adrian Patty
 




  





**The Mission: Launch the Platform for Retirement Wellbeing** 





 Impaktful is focused on solving the non\\-financial challenges of retirement. We are building an AI workflow orchestration engine designed to help people transition from planning their next phase of life to taking meaningful action. The platform's core components and features have been developed, and we are now in the final mile: the critical phase of stabilization, configuration, and deployment. We're looking for a forward\\-thinking engineer to partner with us, using AI\\-agentic coding as a primary tool to get our product launched.
 




  





**Your Role: The AI\\-Augmented ""Finisher""** 





 You are a deeply technical full\\-stack engineer who understands code, architecture, and systems from first principles. However, you choose to build and debug with an AI\\-first mindset. You default to using AI agents (like Cursor) and advanced code generation to solve problems, writing manual code only when necessary. You are a master of prompt engineering for code, an expert at verifying and integrating AI\\-generated outputs, and a pragmatist focused on the fastest path to a robust, production\\-ready solution.
 




  





**What You'll Do:** 



* **AI\\-Agentic Problem Solving:** 

 Leverage AI coding agents and LLMs as your primary tool to diagnose and resolve complex bugs, configuration issues, and integration challenges.
* **CI/CD \\& Environment Configuration:** 

 Take full ownership of the CI/CD pipeline. Configure, stabilize, and automate the end\\-to\\-end testing (Playwright) and deployment process for our Vercel environment.
* **System Stabilization:** 

 Triage the remaining backlog of bugs and feature\\-polish tickets, using an AI\\-driven workflow to implement, test, and validate fixes at an accelerated pace.
* **Strategic Code Implementation:** 

 When AI\\-generated code is insufficient, use your senior\\-level expertise to write clean, efficient, and maintainable TypeScript code that seamlessly integrates with the existing architecture.
* **Founder Collaboration:** 

 Work directly with the founder, Adrian Patty. Adrian has architected the platform and possesses a deep solutions\\-architect level of technical understanding, but is not a hands\\-on coder. Your role will be to translate this architectural vision into a stable, launched product.



  





**The Opportunity: Beyond Launch** 





 This initial contract is focused on one critical goal: launching the platform. Success here opens the door to the next exciting phase of our journey. Post\\-launch, we will move into rapid iteration and enhancement, focusing on:
 



* **Scaling the Ecosystem:** 

 Expanding our B2B partner integrations and enhancing the Partner Dashboard with richer data and insights.
* **Deepening Personalization:** 

 Leveraging the data from our growing community to make our AI\\-driven pathways even more intelligent and empathetic.
* **API\\-First Expansion:** 

 Building out our API to become the indispensable, trusted engine for retirement wellbeing, powering a host of future technologies and partners.



  





**Core Technical Landscape:** 





 You must have a fundamental understanding of and hands\\-on experience with the majority of this stack. Your job will be to configure and debug it, primarily through AI\\-driven methods.
 



* **AI Environment:** 

 Cursor
* **Core:** 

 TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, React 18, Vite
* **Database:** 

 PostgreSQL (Neon Cloud), Drizzle ORM
* **Testing:** 

 Playwright (critical for E2E stabilization), Jest, React Testing Library
* **Infrastructure:** 

 Vercel, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, or similar)
* Authentication:\\*\\* Passport.js, JWT



  





**Role Details:** 



* **Part\\-Time Contract (2\\-4 hours/day):** 

 This is a flexible, part\\-time role with an expected commitment of 2\\-4 hours per day. It's perfect for an expert currently in a full\\-time position who is looking for an exciting project to contribute to and generate extra earnings.
* **High\\-Impact:** 

 You are not just a cog in a machine; you are the critical partner who will help bring a powerful vision to life.



  





**This Role is for You If:** 



* You are fluent in ""prompting"" and can guide an AI to produce complex code and configurations within an environment like Cursor.
* You have a history of successfully configuring and managing CI/CD pipelines for platforms like Vercel.
* You possess a strong foundational knowledge of full\\-stack development, enabling you to effectively validate, debug, and stitch together AI\\-generated code.
* You are a pragmatic ""finisher"" who gets immense satisfaction from shipping and stabilizing complex products.
* You thrive in a high\\-autonomy role and enjoy collaborating directly with a strategic, technical founder.
