**Even better if you have**
* Hands\\-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and deploying services on AWS, GCP, or Azure.
* A strong observability mindset, using logs, metrics, and traces as second nature.
* Practical wins with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic.


**You will thrive in this role if**
