* Mentor and train other team members on design techniques and coding standards.
* Add positive energy in every meeting, and make your coworkers feel included in every interaction.
* 



**What we look for in you:** 



* You have at least 2\\+ years of experience in software engineering.
* Strong full\\-stack engineering skills; you can build reliable backend services and ship fast, accessible UIs that handle real\\-world edge cases.
* Expertise in languages such as Golang (preferred), Python, TypeScript/JavaScript and frameworks like React
* Experience with databases (MongoDB, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL), caching systems (Redis), and message queues (Kafka)
* Solid understanding of distributed systems, microservices architecture, and event\\-driven patterns; you design and integrate cleanly with internal and third\\-party services.
* You write high\\-quality, well\\-tested code to meet the needs of your customers.
* You’re familiar with product and design lifecycles, and collaborating closely with designers, engineers, and product managers
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills, and a bias toward open, transparent cultural practices.
