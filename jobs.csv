 We’re building AI receptionists and workflow automations that act like real employees — handling calls, booking appointments, following up with customers, and connecting deeply with business operations.
 



 Our mission is simple: give every business their own intelligent “front desk” that works 24/7 — without the overhead. We’re starting with service businesses and healthcare, and scaling from there.
 



  





**Why Join Now** 




  





 We’re early. Like
 *really* 
 early. You’ll work directly with the founder to ship products that local businesses actually use — not some abstract internal tool. You’ll help design, build, and ship real AI systems used daily by clinics, pharmacies, towing companies, and construction businesses in the Midwest.
 



 This is not a role where you’ll be stuck writing specs. You’ll be hands\\-on from day one, shipping features and solving tough technical problems with real users on the other side.
 



  





**What You’ll Work On** 



* Building conversational AI receptionists using Retell, n8n, Twilio, and AWS
* Integrating real\\-time voice AI with dashboards, CRMs, and automations
* Architecting backend services to support call logs, appointment scheduling, and analytics
* Creating scalable, HIPAA\\-compliant workflows for clinics and service businesses



  





**What We’re Looking For** 



* Strong foundation in backend or full\\-stack development (Node.js / Python preferred)
* Curiosity about AI, automation, or voice tech
* Builders who thrive in 0 → 1 environments — fast, scrappy, and ambitious
* Bonus: experience with n8n, Twilio, Retell AI, AWS, or similar tools



  





**Why This is Different** 



* This isn’t a giant corporation. If you join Elevaze now, you’ll shape the product, the culture, and maybe even the company’s DNA. Your code won’t disappear into a Jira backlog — it’ll go live to real customers within days.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/elevaze","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFZd3YiilPl-Q/company-logo_100_100/B56ZgMNLEaHcAU-/0/1752551436872?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=fz5Z-bK0TNyKlrDlifLUD1rKARlX-QSq_jCau0JjROk","","","","","","","","","","",""

 About Doaz
 


* Doaz is a hyper\\-growth startup on a mission to turn fragmented industrial knowledge into instant, actionable insight. We build LLM\\- and Vision\\-AI solutions for construction, heavy industry, and finance leaders who must transform terabytes of drawings, specifications, and regulations into real\\-time decisions.
* We’re expanding our GeoAI programs (including joint work with POSCO E\\&C) and launching drawing\\-change detection services that automatically compare plan versions, detect deltas, and explain design impacts.



 Why You’ll Love Working Here
 



 • True 0\\-to\\-1 ownership — Ship models that land in production sites within weeks.
 



 • Global impact, lean crew — 30 teammates across KR🇰🇷/PK🇵🇰/IN🇮🇳; no bureaucracy, only builders.
 



 • Tech freedom — YOLO or RT\\-DETR? Gemma\\-VL, Qwen\\-VL, or LLaVA? You choose, we fund.
 



 Role Overview
 



 We’re hiring a Senior Computer Vision \\& Multimodal LLM Engineer (GeoAI \\& Drawing Change Analysis).
 



 You’ll lead end\\-to\\-end development of a version\\-aware drawing\\-diff engine (PDF/DWG raster \\& vector), symbol/text extraction, and change\\-impact narratives powered by RAG/LLM. Expect fast cycles from prototype → service: detection models, OCR/layout understanding, retrieval, and explainable outputs that engineers can trust.
 



  





 Key Responsibilities
 



 Drawing Change Analysis (CV)
 


* Build a robust diff pipeline for architectural/structural/MEP drawings: rasterization, layer parsing, vector geometry ops, and semantic change clustering.
* Train/finetune detectors \\& segmenters (e.g., YOLOv8/RT\\-DETR/Detectron2/SAM) for symbols (columns, openings, sleeves), title blocks, and revision clouds; achieve production\\-grade mAP/F1\\.
* Implement geometry\\-aware post\\-processing (IoU/topology checks, snapping, graph connectivity) to reduce false positives.



 Document \\& Layout Understanding
 


* Engineer OCR \\+ layout models (PaddleOCR/Tesseract \\+ DocFormer/LayoutLMv3/Donut) to read legends, notes, schedules, and BOM tables; normalize to structured JSON.
* Build version\\-aware entity tracking (IDs, gridlines, BH IDs, coordinates) across revisions.



 GeoAI \\& LLM/RAG
 


* Design retrieval over drawings/specs (BM25 \\+ vector) with reranking; ground LLM answers in evidence with citations and clickable locations.
* Generate change\\-impact summaries (e.g., slab shear reinforcement, opening proximity to columns) with rules \\+ LLM verification; measure factual precision.



 Productization \\& DevOps
 


* Ship FastAPI/gRPC microservices, batch \\& streaming workers (Ray/Celery), GPU inference (Triton/TensorRT), and observability (Prometheus/Grafana).
* Own evaluation: dataset curation, data labeling guidelines, ablation/A\\-B tests, and regression suites.



 Collaboration
 


* Work closely with domain SMEs (geotech/structural) to encode rules (KDS/KBC, internal standards) and prioritize what matters to the field.



 Minimum Qualifications
 


* 5\\+ years of production Python (3\\.x) building ML\\-heavy backends; strong PyTorch.
* 3\\+ years in computer vision for detection/segmentation/OCR or document AI at scale.
* Hands\\-on with multimodal LLM/RAG (LangChain/LlamaIndex), vector DBs (Pinecone/Weaviate/FAISS), and rerankers.
* Proven experience parsing engineering drawings or complex PDFs (vector/raster), including geometry and layout reasoning.
* Solid MLOps: reproducible training, CI/CD, model packaging, monitoring; cloud on AWS/GCP.
* Fluent written \\& spoken English (Korean a plus).



 Preferred Extras
 


* GPU orchestration (Kubernetes/Ray/Slurm), high\\-performance inference (ONNX/TensorRT).
* Experience with VLMs (Gemma\\-VL, Qwen\\-VL, LLaVA), CLIP, or doc\\-layout models.
* Open\\-source contributions, papers, or strong public demos in CV/doc AI/RAG.
* Full\\-stack chops (TypeScript/Next.js/React) for quick operator tools and review UIs.



 Compensation \\& Benefits
 


* Competitive base salary (market\\-leading) , around 20 lakh (yearly)
* Performance\\-based annual bonus (up to 20%).
* cloud credits, and AI tools support.



  





 Hiring Process (≈ 2–3 weeks)
 


* Quick intro call (15 min, mutual fit).
* 48\\-hour take\\-home: Drawing Diff \\+ Evidence\\-Grounded Summary (provide code \\+ short README; clarity \\> polish).
* Deep\\-dive tech interview: architecture, modeling choices, evaluation, and scaling plan.
* Culture \\& vision chat with Founder/CEO.
* Offer — if all green, written offer within 24 h.



  





 How to Apply
 



 Email doaz@doaz.ai with subject \\[CV/LLM Engineer – Your Name] and include:
 


* Résumé/CV with measurable outcomes (metrics, latency, cost, accuracy).
* Current or recent salary.
* GitHub and/or live demos of CV/doc\\-AI/RAG work (links preferred).
* A one\\-page diagram of your “Drawing Revision → Detection → Evidence → LLM Narrative” pipeline, noting models, retrieval, and evaluation metrics.
