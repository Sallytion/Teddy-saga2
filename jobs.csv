 We are building a new Software Assurance Gateway team at OCI. Our mission is to build and operate a set of gateway services to perform comprehensive software assurance of the applications running within a tenancy. Software assurance includes measures to prevent the deployment of malware or vulnerable, malicious, or unauthorized code into the application’s tenancy.

The software gateway services will intercept web traffic, operator actions, and CI/CD pipelines to perform a set of assurance functions such as vulnerability scanning, signature validation, rules checking, policy compliance and anomaly detection. These functions will generate logs, audit trails, metrics, and alerts to enable automated and manual assurance of code as well as ingress/egress traffic. The team will develop and maintain the gateway code as well as operate the gateway infrastructure for the application. The team will be responsible for the performance, scalability, and reliability of the gateways. In particular, they will be responsible for ensuring that the performance of the application, as well as the developer velocity of the application teams, are not negatively impacted by the assurance gateways. They will optimize the gateway code to ensure low overhead and they will scale the gateways to handle increases in traffic and in the frequencies of application updates. As Senior Software Engineer, you will work with a team of software engineers responsible for the software design, development, and operations for our new and existing products. You should be able to architect broad systems interactions, be hands\\-on, be able to dive deep into any part of the stack, and have a good sense of cloud infrastructure and networking knowledge. You should value simplicity and impact, work comfortably in a collaborative, agile environment, and be excited to learn. Our senior engineers are also the people who can work independently and provide technical leadership to the organization. You should have experience developing and operating high\\-scale services, and an understanding of how to make these cloud\\-scale services resilient. The ideal candidate will be technically strong and productive; someone who knows how to balance speed and quality with iterative and incremental improvements. You understand operational excellence and know\\-how to infuse a culture of being proactive within your team. You recommend and justify major changes to new and existing products and establish consensus with data\\-driven approaches.

 Project: B2B AI Itinerary Builder for Travel Industry
   

 Location: Remote / Delhi
   

 Salary: ₹3L \\- ₹5L PA
   

 ​The Mission
   

 ​We are a travel company specializing in Japan and luxury travel. We are currently building a proprietary AI\\-Powered Itinerary Builder—a tool that allows travel agents to generate complex, logistics\\-heavy travel plans in seconds rather than hours.
   

 ​We need a developer to help us build the ""Brain"" of this tool. This is not a simple wrapper around ChatGPT; this is a travel industry tool that requires handling dates, locations, pricing, and structured data reliability.
   

 ​The Challenge
   

 ​Travel data is messy. LLMs are slow.
   

 Your job is to bridge that gap. You will build a system where a user inputs ""10 Days in Japan, mix of Anime and Nature,"" and the system outputs a structured, priced, and logical day\\-by\\-day itinerary.
   

 ​Key Responsibilities
   

 ​Build the Logic: Develop the Python backend that manages travel constraints (e.g., ensuring Day 1 activities actually fit in Day 1\\).
   

 ​GenAI Integration: Write complex prompts to extract structured JSON from OpenAI/Anthropic APIs (not just text).
   

 ​Queue Management (Celery): Travel generation takes time (20\\-40s). You will implement Celery \\& Redis to handle these long\\-running tasks asynchronously so the UI never freezes.
   

 ​Format Handling: Convert AI output into standardized formats for our frontend (PDF generation/Web View).
   

 ​Requirements
   

 ​Python Strong: Experience with FastAPI or Django.
   

 ​Async Experience: You must understand how to run background tasks using Celery (essential for this role).
   

 ​GenAI/LLM Interest: Experience working with OpenAI APIs, specifically ""Function Calling"" or ""JSON Mode.""
   

 ​Travel Domain Sense: You understand that a flight arriving at 8 PM means the user cannot do a sightseeing tour at 9 AM that same day. You can think logically about time and logistics.
   

 ​Tech Stack You Will Use
   

 ​Backend: Python (FastAPI/Django)
   

 ​AI: OpenAI GPT\\-4o / LangChain
   

 ​Async: Celery \\+ Redis
   

 ​Database: PostgreSQL
   

 ​Why Apply?
   

 ​Build a Real Product: You are the primary developer for a tool that will be used by real travel businesses immediately.
   

 ​Travel Industry Exposure: Learn how Travel Tech works (APIs, GDS, Itinerary Logic).
   

 ​Modern Tech: Gain production experience with GenAI and Asynchronous Task Queues.
   

 ​How to Apply
   

 ​Send your resume and a link to your GitHub.
