**Rippling PEO (Professional Employer Organization) And HR Services Overview**
 Rippling’s
 ****PEO (Professional Employer Organization)****
 and
 ****HR Services****
 products help founders and small businesses build faster — and succeed with lower failure rates. Together, they drive over
 ****$140M in annual revenue****
 , forming a core pillar of Rippling’s business.
   

  

 In the early years, these systems were built at breakneck speed to enable go\\-to\\-market growth — fueling massive adoption but introducing tech debt and tightly coupled designs.
   

  

 Now in
 ****Phase L2****
 , the team is rebuilding the foundation into an
 ****extensible, use\\-case–driven architecture****
 — transforming complex, hard\\-coded systems into scalable, modular platforms. You’ll play a key role in re\\-imagining the backbone of Rippling’s HR ecosystem — improving developer velocity, reducing operational friction, and unlocking new market opportunities.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* System Reliability: Enterprise\\-grade stability across global employment, benefits, and compliance workflows, with zero critical failures in employee lifecycle operations.
* Extensibility: New employment models, jurisdictions, and compliance frameworks added with minimal engineering effort and zero downtime.
* Performance: Significant reduction in workflow latency, data synchronization time, and operational overhead across distributed systems.
* Developer Velocity: Modular, well\\-abstracted APIs and frameworks that empower internal teams to build on top of PEO systems without friction.
* Business Impact: Faster onboarding for new countries and partners, reduced manual interventions, and measurable improvements in customer satisfaction and retention.


**Required Qualifications**
* 14\\+ years of experience building large\\-scale, distributed systems in high\\-compliance or high\\-integrity domains (HR, Payroll, FinTech, or Insurance).
* Deep expertise in domain\\-driven design, data modeling, and compliance\\-first architecture.
* Experience scaling complex regulatory or multi\\-tenant systems, ideally spanning employment, benefits, or HR platforms.
* Proficiency in designing extensible, modular service boundaries that maintain auditability and backward compatibility.
* Strong understanding of policy enforcement, rule engines, and event\\-driven systems.
* Ability to translate legal and operational complexity into elegant, maintainable engineering abstractions.
* A hands\\-on architectural leader who can set technical direction, mentor teams, and drive large\\-scale transformations sustainably.


****Bonus Points****
* Experience with compliance\\-as\\-code or policy automation frameworks.
* Exposure to global employment, EOR, or multi\\-country workforce systems.
* Familiarity with event sourcing, CQRS, and streaming architectures.
* Contributions to open\\-source frameworks in HR, compliance, or distributed systems domains.


****Why Rippling****
* Backed by world\\-class investors (Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, Bedrock, GIC, Elad Gil, Goldman Sachs)
* Valued among the fastest\\-growing SaaS companies in history
* Built at the core of Rippling’s HR foundation, where global employment, compliance, and workforce management come together as one seamless system.
* Join a team that pushes the limits of possible, builds winning systems, and moves fast with conviction.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/rippling","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGVw6UsjqtXGw/company-logo_100_100/B4EZlN73QeHIAQ-/0/1757949162831/rippling_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=_-PZ3E8XmdCyc89UhLvip3soyI97bY1FRM89cZYXEiQ","","","","","","","","","","",""
