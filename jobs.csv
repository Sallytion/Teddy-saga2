Founded in 2014 by Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar with a simple vision — to simplify payments for Indian businesses — we’ve since grown into a fintech powerhouse driving India’s digital payment revolution.
   

  

 Razorpay powers millions of businesses with a smarter, scalable stack that goes beyond transactions to help them truly build and grow.
   

  

 From seamless checkouts to payroll automation, across India, Singapore, and Malaysia, we’ve been engineering a fintech ecosystem that’s redefining how money moves across Asia — and we’re just getting started.
   

  

 Today, that ecosystem supports everyone from early\\-stage startups to some of India’s largest enterprises, enabling them to accept, process, and disburse payments at scale while expanding into new ways of managing money more efficiently.
   

  

 Our scale speaks volumes: Razorpay processes $180\\+ billion in annualized transactions, powering leading businesses like Airbnb, Facebook, WhatsApp, Airtel, CRED, BookmyShow, Zomato, Swiggy, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme — and over 100 of India’s unicorns. With strong roots in India and growing operations in Southeast Asia, we are shaping the next chapter of financial technology across the region.
   

  

 We are backed by global investors including GIC, Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India \\& SEA), Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, MasterCard, and Salesforce Ventures, having raised over $740 million to date. Strategic acquisitions — including Ezetap (POS and offline payments), Curlec (Malaysia expansion), BillMe (digital invoicing), and POP (rewards\\-first UPI) — along with earlier moves in fraud prevention, payroll, and lending, have further strengthened our platform and widened our footprint across Asia.
   

  

 But what truly sets Razorpay apart is our culture. At Razorpay, ownership is our oxygen — you own what you build, with no micromanagement or red tape, just the runway to make your ideas fly. Learning is a lifestyle — if you’re curious, you’ll feel at home here. People \\> Pedigree — we hire for attitude, hustle, and hunger more than degrees. Transparency thrives over titles — this is where interns question CXOs and CXOs say “thank you.” Guided by our values of Customer First, Autonomy \\& Ownership, Agility with Integrity, Transparency, Challenging the status quo and a strong belief that Razorpay grows with Razors, you’ll be part of a 3000\\+ strong team building not just products, but the financial infrastructure of the future.

Engineering creates a significant impact across different areas, considering the scale of our software product outreach. You’re also expected to influence the culture of the company and help shape it in the right way.
   

  

**Roles And Responsibilities**
* Be involved and drive product \\& design discussions.
* Help us scale our payment infrastructure to get every Indian to pay online.
* Help us make decisions to shape our REST APIs for developers worldwide.
* Contribute to open source as we set the standards for mobile payments.
* Be involved and drive product \\& design discussions.
* And, most importantly, brainstorm and create new directions that Razorpay can take in our quest to make online payments easy and accessible to all.


**Mandatory Qualifications**
* 3\\+ years of experience in Technology.
* A strong product design sense.
* Good experience in working with any of the programming languages like PHP, Python, Django, Golang, Java, C\\+\\+
* Understand end\\-user requirements, formulate use cases and come up with effective solutions.

**Senior Shopify Engineer**
 We are seeking a Senior Shopify Engineer with lead potential to architect enterprise\\-level commerce solutions and steer our technical direction. This role requires a blend of deep frontend mastery and sophisticated backend integration skills, combined with the ability to navigate complex problem statements and mentor a growing development team.
   

  

**Role Overview**
 As a Senior Shopify Engineer, you will bridge the gap between business requirements and technical architecture. You will collaborate closely with our Lead Architect to contribute to technical discovery sessions, design custom integrations for Shopify Plus merchants, and own the development of the most complex platform features. A core part of this role involves technical leadership: you will navigate the solution path for complex projects, groom technical stories, and delegate specific implementation tasks to the Shopify Engineering team.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Collaborative Discovery: Work alongside the Architect during client\\-facing discovery sessions to identify technical risks and opportunities. Use your depth of experience to guide conversations and translate merchant needs into robust technical roadmaps.
* Advanced Development: Act as the primary developer for the most difficult and nuanced project components. You are expected to be hands\\-on, developing complex solutions rather than simply handing off designs.
* Backlog Grooming \\& Handoff: Define technical tasks and specifications for Shopify Engineers. Groom user stories into actionable development tasks, providing the necessary technical context for the base engineering team to succeed.
* Solution Architecture: Contribute to the technical design of enterprise\\-scale Shopify Plus stores, making critical decisions on theme architecture vs. custom app builds vs. third\\-party integrations.
* Advanced Integrations: Architect and implement secure connections between Shopify and enterprise systems (ERPs, CRMs, OMS, and PIMs) using GraphQL and REST APIs.
* Shopify Plus Mastery: Spearhead the implementation of advanced Plus features, including Checkout Extensibility, Shopify Functions, B2B logic, and complex metaobject architectures.
* Performance \\& Security: Support and help drive the end\\-to\\-end performance strategy and security posture for high\\-volume stores, ensuring scalability during peak traffic events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday).


**Required Skills \\& Experience**
* 5\\+ years of professional frontend or full\\-stack experience, with at least 3 years dedicated to the Shopify platform.
* Advanced Platform Knowledge: Expert\\-level mastery of Shopify Plus, including its limitations and extensibility points.
* API Expertise: Deep experience with the Shopify GraphQL Admin API and Storefront API.
* Backend Proficiency: Ability to build and maintain custom Shopify apps (Node.js/Remix or similar) or middleware when off\\-the\\-shelf solutions are insufficient.
* Modern Tooling: Expertise in Shopify CLI, CI/CD pipelines for commerce, and advanced Git workflows.
* Strategic Problem Solving: Proven track record of solving ""non\\-standard"" commerce problems that require moving beyond Liquid templates.


**Architectural Leadership**
* Technology Selection: Ability to articulate the trade\\-offs between different technical approaches (e.g., Headless vs. Hydrogen vs. Liquid\\-first) to both internal teams and clients.
* Problem Finding: A proactive approach to identifying technical debt or performance bottlenecks before they impact the merchant’s bottom line.


**Soft Skills**
* Leadership \\& Delegation: Strong ability to break down complex project goals into actionable tasks for other developers.
* Client Consultation: Excellent communication skills to lead technical discussions with enterprise\\-level stakeholders.
* Decision Making: Confidence in making high\\-stakes technical choices and standing by them under project pressure.

 We are seeking a Senior Shopify Engineer with lead potential to architect enterprise\\-level commerce solutions and steer our technical direction. This role requires a blend of deep frontend mastery and sophisticated backend integration skills, combined with the ability to navigate complex problem statements and mentor a growing development team.
   

  

**Role Overview**
 As a Senior Shopify Engineer, you will bridge the gap between business requirements and technical architecture. You will collaborate closely with our Lead Architect to contribute to technical discovery sessions, design custom integrations for Shopify Plus merchants, and own the development of the most complex platform features.

**Key Responsibilities**
* Collaborative Discovery: Work alongside the Architect during client\\-facing discovery sessions to identify technical risks and opportunities. Use your depth of experience to guide conversations and translate merchant needs into robust technical roadmaps.
* Advanced Development: Act as the primary developer for the most difficult and nuanced project components. You are expected to be hands\\-on, developing complex solutions rather than simply handing off designs.
* Backlog Grooming \\& Handoff: Define technical tasks and specifications for Shopify Engineers. Groom user stories into actionable development tasks, providing the necessary technical context for the base engineering team to succeed.
* Solution Architecture: Contribute to the technical design of enterprise\\-scale Shopify Plus stores, making critical decisions on theme architecture vs. custom app builds vs. third\\-party integrations.
* Advanced Integrations: Architect and implement secure connections between Shopify and enterprise systems (ERPs, CRMs, OMS, and PIMs) using GraphQL and REST APIs.
* Shopify Plus Mastery: Spearhead the implementation of advanced Plus features, including Checkout Extensibility, Shopify Functions, B2B logic, and complex metaobject architectures.
* Performance \\& Security: Support and help drive the end\\-to\\-end performance strategy and security posture for high\\-volume stores, ensuring scalability during peak traffic events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday).


**Required Skills \\& Experience**
* 5\\+ years of professional frontend or full\\-stack experience, with at least 3 years dedicated to the Shopify platform.
* Advanced Platform Knowledge: Expert\\-level mastery of Shopify Plus, including its limitations and extensibility points.
* API Expertise: Deep experience with the Shopify GraphQL Admin API and Storefront API.
* Backend Proficiency: Ability to build and maintain custom Shopify apps (Node.js/Remix or similar) or middleware when off\\-the\\-shelf solutions are insufficient.
* Modern Tooling: Expertise in Shopify CLI, CI/CD pipelines for commerce, and advanced Git workflows.
* Strategic Problem Solving: Proven track record of solving ""non\\-standard"" commerce problems that require moving beyond Liquid templates.


**Architectural Leadership**
* Technology Selection: Ability to articulate the trade\\-offs between different technical approaches (e.g., Headless vs. Hydrogen vs. Liquid\\-first) to both internal teams and clients.
* Problem Finding: A proactive approach to identifying technical debt or performance bottlenecks before they impact the merchant’s bottom line.


**Soft Skills**
* Leadership \\& Delegation: Strong ability to break down complex project goals into actionable tasks for other developers.
* Client Consultation: Excellent communication skills to lead technical discussions with enterprise\\-level stakeholders.
* Decision Making: Confidence in making high\\-stakes technical choices and standing by them under project pressure.

**Digital Agency is Looking for:******
**Senior Shopify Engineer**
 We are seeking a Senior Shopify Engineer with lead potential to architect enterprise\\-level commerce solutions and steer our technical direction. This role requires a blend of deep frontend mastery and sophisticated backend integration skills, combined with the ability to navigate complex problem statements and mentor a growing development team.
   

  

**Role Overview**
 As a Senior Shopify Engineer, you will bridge the gap between business requirements and technical architecture. You will collaborate closely with our Lead Architect to contribute to technical discovery sessions, design custom integrations for Shopify Plus merchants, and own the development of the most complex platform features. A core part of this role involves technical leadership: you will navigate the solution path for complex projects, groom technical stories, and delegate specific implementation tasks to the Shopify Engineering team.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Collaborative Discovery: Work alongside the Architect during client\\-facing discovery sessions to identify technical risks and opportunities. Use your depth of experience to guide conversations and translate merchant needs into robust technical roadmaps.
* Advanced Development: Act as the primary developer for the most difficult and nuanced project components. You are expected to be hands\\-on, developing complex solutions rather than simply handing off designs.
* Backlog Grooming \\& Handoff: Define technical tasks and specifications for Shopify Engineers. Groom user stories into actionable development tasks, providing the necessary technical context for the base engineering team to succeed.
* Solution Architecture: Contribute to the technical design of enterprise\\-scale Shopify Plus stores, making critical decisions on theme architecture vs. custom app builds vs. third\\-party integrations.
* Advanced Integrations: Architect and implement secure connections between Shopify and enterprise systems (ERPs, CRMs, OMS, and PIMs) using GraphQL and REST APIs.
* Shopify Plus Mastery: Spearhead the implementation of advanced Plus features, including Checkout Extensibility, Shopify Functions, B2B logic, and complex metaobject architectures.
* Performance \\& Security: Support and help drive the end\\-to\\-end performance strategy and security posture for high\\-volume stores, ensuring scalability during peak traffic events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday).


**Required Skills \\& Experience**
* 5\\+ years of professional frontend or full\\-stack experience, with at least 3 years dedicated to the Shopify platform.
* Advanced Platform Knowledge: Expert\\-level mastery of Shopify Plus, including its limitations and extensibility points.
* API Expertise: Deep experience with the Shopify GraphQL Admin API and Storefront API.
* Backend Proficiency: Ability to build and maintain custom Shopify apps (Node.js/Remix or similar) or middleware when off\\-the\\-shelf solutions are insufficient.
