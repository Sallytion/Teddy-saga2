 Are you eager to shape the future of video entertainment, from movies and TV shows to live sports events? Do you enjoy tackling complex challenges within large\\-scale systems? If so, we invite you to help build the future of entertainment with us at Prime Video!
   

  

 Since its launch in 2007, Prime Video has been transforming the traditional television and movie industry. With a rapidly expanding library of high\\-quality content and availability in over 240 countries and territories, Prime Video is now a key strategic priority for Amazon. We invest heavily in acquiring, producing, and programming a diverse range of TV shows, movies, and live events. Our exclusive titles include ""The Lord of the Rings,"" ""The Boys,"" ""The Wheel of Time,"" and ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,"" among others. Beyond our extensive On\\-Demand catalog, Prime Video offers a wide selection of Linear Channels and Live Sports, featuring major events like Thursday Night Football, the English Premier League, NBA, MLB, ATP tennis, French Open, and the UEFA Champions League. If this sparks your interest, read on!
   

  

 Key job responsibilities
   

  

* Design, develop, and maintain highly scalable systems that power Prime Video's streaming services.
* Define the architecture for our software, utilizing a broad range of technologies, programming languages, and systems.
* Implement and operate APIs that manage billions of playback start requests, ensuring seamless, low\\-latency content delivery.
* Collaborate with cross\\-functional teams to influence the overall technical strategy and contribute to the team's long\\-term roadmap.
* Communicate effectively across teams and stakeholders, ensuring alignment with technical goals and project timelines.

 A day in the life
   

  

 As a software engineer on the Prime Video team, my day starts with diving into hands\\-on coding and technical problem\\-solving. I'm not just writing code\\-I'm helping to shape the architecture of complex systems that millions of people rely on every day. One of the most rewarding aspects of my role is seeing my work come to life when friends and family use Prime Video to watch their favorite shows and live sports.
   

  

 My primary focus is on designing and maintaining the APIs that power every title on Prime Video. This involves creating highly reliable and low\\-latency systems that ensure users can start streaming their content with just a click. The challenges are unique, especially when it comes to managing the sheer scale of requests we handle daily. To tackle these, I leverage AWS technologies like EC2, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, and CloudFront.
   

  

 Collaboration is a significant aspect of my role. I collaborate with a cross\\-functional team to align our technical strategies and define our long\\-term roadmap. It's exhilarating to influence decisions that will shape the future of Prime Video. Throughout the day, I alternate between deep focus on coding and brainstorming sessions with my teammates to tackle novel challenges.
   

  

 Beyond the technical work, I also play a key role in mentoring junior engineers. Sharing my knowledge and seeing others grow is incredibly fulfilling. I'm always encouraged to push the boundaries of what's possible, and I have the freedom to explore new ideas that can elevate our service to the next level.
   

  

 At the end of the day, I know that the work I do directly contributes to a world\\-class viewing experience for millions of Prime Video users, and that's a great feeling.
