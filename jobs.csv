**Schedule:** 
 India Standard Time \\+ 3–4 hours overlap with Arizona (MST)
 



**Compensation:** 
 $6,000 – $7,000 USD per month (contract)
 



  





**The Opportunity** 




 We are the engineering team behind Cardone Ventures (a 700\\+ person organization). We run a complex, multi\\-application platform on a serverless Azure backbone, serving over 1 million users. We are looking for a Staff Software Engineer. You will be the technical anchor for our 15\\-person engineering group. You will not be managing people; you will be architecting systems across
 **Web (React)** 
 and
 **Mobile (React Native)** 
 while designing the backend (Node/Postgres) to support them.
 



  





**The ""AI\\-Native"" Requirement** 




 We believe the future of engineering belongs to those who leverage AI. We do not want an engineer who manually types every boilerplate line. We want a master architect who aggressively uses LLMs (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot) to accelerate development, generate tests, and refactor code. You should be operating at
 **2–3x the velocity** 
 of a standard senior engineer because you know how to wield AI tools effectively while maintaining strict code quality.
 



  





**Key Responsibilities** 



* **Universal Frontend Architecture:** 
 You will own the architecture for both our Web (React/Next.js) and Mobile (React Native) platforms. You will design strategies to share logic/hooks between web and mobile to maximize efficiency.
* **Backend \\& Data Design:** 
 You will own the data layer. You will design normalized Postgres schemas, optimize complex SQL queries, and ensure our Node.js APIs are type\\-safe and performant.
* **System Design:** 
 You will architect Azure Serverless functions to handle high concurrency. You understand how to build resilient systems without reliance on containers/Docker.
* **Code Review \\& Standards:** 
 You will review the most critical PRs. You will ensure that while we move fast with AI, we never ship hallucinations or bad patterns.



  





**The Stack** 



* **Frontend:** 
 React, Next.js, React Native (Expo), TypeScript, Tailwind.
* **Backend:** 
 Node.js, PostgreSQL, Azure Functions (Serverless).
* **Tooling:** 
 GitHub Actions, AI\\-First Workflow (Cursor/Claude Code/Copilot).

* **Staff Level Experience:** 
 5\\+ years building production systems. You have been the ""Go\\-To"" technical person on previous teams.
* **React \\& React Native Fluency:** 
 You have shipped complex apps on both web and mobile. You understand the nuances of the React Native bridge, identifying performance bottlenecks on mobile vs. web.
* **Database Mastery:** 
 Strong proficiency in PostgreSQL (Indexing, JSONB, complex joins). You are comfortable writing raw SQL when ORMs fall short.
* **AI\\-Augmented Workflow:** 
 You can demonstrate how you use LLMs to speed up documentation, unit testing, and complex refactoring.
