**Location:** 
 Noida
   

  

**Experience Role Type: 1\\+** 
 years
   

  

**Role Type:** 
 Full\\-Time, Onsite
   

  

**About Seventh Triangle**
 Seventh Triangle is a leading consumer tech and ecommerce consulting firm and a Shopify Plus Partner, working with some of India’s largest enterprise brands. With a 150\\+ member team across Noida and Bangalore, we specialise in technology development, UI/UX, marketing strategy, performance advertising, retention, and digital commerce transformation.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for a hands\\-on Frontend Developer who genuinely cares about UI quality, stability, and performance. This role is not for someone who wants a “React\\-only” job. We need someone who can work across React, Next.js, HTML/CSS/JS, and Shopify Liquid, and take complete ownership of their work.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Build production\\-ready, stable, and polished frontend experiences using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Identify even the smallest UI imperfections — flickers, layout shifts, slow rendering, inconsistent spacing — and fix them proactively.
* Work on site performance improvements: LCP, CLS, image optimization, caching strategies, lazy\\-loading, etc.
* Implement analytics \\& tracking using GTM, GA4, Meta Pixel, and similar tools.
* Own assigned modules completely — from understanding requirements → planning → execution → delivery — without constant supervision.
* Work across different tech stacks depending on the project: React apps, Next.js websites, Shopify Liquid themes \\& components.
* Troubleshoot UI bugs, browser inconsistencies, state flow issues, and frontend performance problems.


**Required Skills \\& Expectations**
**Core Technical Skills**
* Minimum 1 year of production experience building and releasing real websites.
* Strong base in HTML, CSS, JavaScript — candidates who only know React without fundamentals will not be considered.
* Proficient with React; experience with Next.js is a strong plus.
* Shopify Liquid experience is a major advantage (or willingness to learn quickly).
* Understanding of Core Web Vitals and practical experience improving LCP, CLS, and overall performance.
* Working knowledge of GTM, GA, and other analytics integrations.


**Quality \\+ Ownership**
* Extreme attention to detail — anything visually or interactively off must be unacceptable to you.
* Problem\\-solving mindset is non\\-negotiable — if you cannot debug issues logically, this is not the right role.
* Ability to take ownership of a project/module without hand\\-holding.
* Comfortable with any frontend task — small UI bug to enterprise\\-scale feature, React to Liquid, basic page to complex component.
* Must be open and motivated to grow into a complete frontend engineer, not restricted to a single framework.


**Good To Have**
* Knowledge of SEO\\-friendly frontend practices.
* Understanding of Web Accessibility basics.
* Familiarity with Git workflows and modern development tooling.
* Knowledge of state\\-management libraries such as Redux, MobX, or Zustand is a plus.
* Experience with AI\\-assisted coding tools (Copilot, Cursor, etc.).


**Format Requirements**
* Keep the entire submission under 300 words.
* Keep each answer 3–5 sentences.
* This writeup must be strictly written by you, not by AI tools.


**Important – Zero Tolerance Policy**
* We evaluate tone, structure, and writing patterns.
* If your note appears generic, templated, or AI\\-generated,
* your application will be rejected immediately without review.
* We also verify this during the interview.
* If your explanation does not match your written submission, the application is disqualified.


**Who Should Apply**
* Someone who wants to master the entire frontend ecosystem, not one library.
* Someone who focuses on quality, details, and smooth user experience.
* Someone who takes ownership, can deliver independently, and enjoys problem solving.


**Who Should NOT Apply**
* If you want a React\\-only role.
* If you are not detail\\-oriented.
* If you rely heavily on AI to write or debug everything.
* If you need constant reminders and follow\\-ups on tasks.","IT Services and IT Consulting","https://in.linkedin.com/company/seventh-triangle-consulting","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQF4aKuBWVJJGw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1658490510864/seventh_triangle_consulting_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7yLfMMHgAXlN3aeofBnx3ZefesfKx-dUAFaILW92FwA","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Deep learning and generative models are reshaping how people discover and engage with ads. Microsoft Ads runs large\\-scale recommender systems that serve billions of requests under tight latency, cost, and reliability conditions.
   

  

 Delivering relevant ads efficiently at this scale requires innovation across the full stack: models, kernels, serving systems, and GPU/accelerator infrastructure. We are looking for a Senior Applied Scientist with strong foundations in systems and machine learning, and with experience in one or more of the following areas:
   

  

* Large\\-scale inference and serving architectures
* Ads retrieval, ranking, and recommendation models optimized for online performance
* GPU / accelerator programming and kernel optimization


 Primary success metric is (latency, cost, revenue) in production, while also helping shape the technical direction of Ads recommendation and inference
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Design and optimize end\\-to\\-end Ads inference model \\& workflows for retrieval \\& ranking meeting strict p99 latency and throughput goals.
* Invent and implement efficiency techniques such as dynamic batching, routing, scheduling, caching, sequence packing, quantization, and speculative decoding to improve utilization and tail latency.
* Develop and tune GPU kernels and operators eg kernel fusion, memory\\-aware layouts, sparsity.
* Use profiling and diagnostic tools to analyze GPU utilization, memory bandwidth, and kernel performance
* Design and evolve serving architectures for multi\\-tenant workloads, including policies for placement, parallelism, autoscaling, and safe rollout under real\\-world SLOs.
* Build and optimize caching layers and KV\\-cache management (feature/result caches, request deduplication, paging/offload) to improve both latency and efficiency.
* Co\\-design model architectures that are inference\\-friendly while preserving or improving quality metrics


**Qualifications**
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Electrical/Computer Engineering, or a related field, with 6\\+ years of related experience.
* Strong programming skills in C\\+\\+ or Python (both are a plus; at least one is required).
* Hands\\-on experience in one or more:
+ Implementing and deploying deep learning models for online inference,
+ Building and operating latency\\-sensitive online services at scale
+ GPU/accelerator programming and performance optimization.

* Experience with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX.
* Ability to design experiments, analyze results, and make data\\-driven decisions in complex systems.
* Strong communication and collaboration skills, with experience working across ML, systems, and product or business stakeholders.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* 3\\+ years of experience in Kernel programming and Inference optimization
* Experience with inference serving frameworks (for example: vLLM, Triton Inference Server, TensorRT\\-LLM or similar).
* Deep understanding of inference efficiency techniques for LLM/SLM (paged KV cache, continuous batching/sequence packing, speculative decoding, quantization, adapters/LoRA, sparsity).
* Familiarity with compiler and auto\\-tuning techniques, automated kernel/code generation, or ML\\-based performance optimization.
* Background in cost/performance modeling, capacity planning, and autoscaling for large fleets of GPUs or accelerators.
* Experience in Ads, search, recommendations, or similar large\\-scale ranking systems where latency, cost, and relevance are jointly optimized (strong plus, but not required).
* Track record of impact via research publications, patents, or shipping large\\-scale systems in ML, systems, or recommendation domains
