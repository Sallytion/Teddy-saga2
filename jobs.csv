 🧬
 



 Today over 1\\.78 million of small and medium\\-sized businesses in Europe alone need to be compliant with information security frameworks to be able to sell their products and services to enterprise customers.
 



 Secfix automates security compliance for SMBs in Europe. We help SMBs automate ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks instead of months. Our platform integrates with a company’s tech stack (like AWS, Azure AD, Jira, etc.), automatically extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain compliant.
 



 We grew fast and are looking for skilled engineers to help us improve and scale our product. Check our culture guide.
 



  





**Why you should join Secfix** 




 Secfix is an early\\-stage fully remote startup in the best sense of the word. We’re a fun, close\\-knit team on a mission to become the European compliance automation leader.
 



 We grew from 0 revenue to \\>1M$ ARR within two years and most of our costs are already covered by revenue. Now we are looking to grow further and faster.
 



 Our trajectory is backed by top investors (4\\.4M$ raised), including Octopus Ventures, Neosfer (Commerzbank), founders of Signavio and many more angels.
 



 As a Senior Backend Engineer, you will help shape and build every product we deliver to real customers: CTOs, COOs and engineering teams of small and medium businesses. You will also be part of growing a high\\-performance fully remote software startup.
 



  





**Who are we looking for?** 




 We're building an environment at Secfix where ambitious, independent engineers can thrive. We want to grow with people who take pride in building actual products, who are curious about how the features we ship are used daily — and who bring a design\\-first mindset (plan before coding) to ensure scalable, maintainable systems. We own products and outcomes, not Jira tickets.
 



 We understand that startup life can be demanding, but we believe it doesn’t have to be stressful. Bring your commitment and drive to grow, and we’ll deliver an environment that keeps you happy, healthy, and empowered to do your best work with us.
 



  





 You 
 **should** 
  apply if:
 


* You’re ambitious, independent and growth\\-oriented
* You’re comfortable with startup life ambiguity, adapting to changing priorities based on customer and market feedback, and wearing multiple hats
* You bring senior talent to our team with 5\\+ years of equivalent experience
* You’re comfortable collaborating and communicating in a remote environment, especially in writing and with Loom. You understand that working independently doesn't mean working alone. Remember, it requires more pro\\-active communication than working in the office
* You can mentor other developers and do code reviews.
* You know how to balance speed and quality and how to build leverage in your work through automation, abstractions and good software design and architecture
* You’re excited not only to use AI tools like Cursor, or Claude Code consciously — not just for speed, but for better design, refactoring, and testing but also building AI tools.



  





 You 
 **should not apply** 
 if:
 


* You need a lot of processes to tell you what to do or you're comfortable only picking up tickets from a JIRA board
* You are not disciplined and organized in how you document and communicate your work with collegues
* You only want to write code and don’t really care about the bigger picture and customers
* You don’t want to test, deploy, monitor and troubleshoot your own code
* You don’t want to lead your own projects, but rather be led by someone else
* You don't want to collaborate closely with other areas of the business or engage with users when needed



  





**What you’ll do day\\-to\\-day** 



* You’ll be the go\\-to person for all things backend in your product area
* You’ll work closely with the CTO and the Tech Lead to set technical direction
* You’ll work closely with our product and design teams and with our customers to identify, plan, design, build and ship features on schedule
* You’ll deploy, monitor, troubleshoot, debug, support, maintain and evolve features and code under your responsibility
* You’ll leverage AI\\-powered engineering tools (Cursor, Claude, etc.) to accelerate development, debugging, and testing.
* You’ll own and maintain product and technical documentation
* You’ll support other team members on your area of expertise, mentor and develop junior engineers
* You’ll follow company's culture and communication guidelines
* Live by 
 
 our values



  





**What you’ll need** 



* 5\\-8 years of of industry experience as a backend or product engineer, building user\\-facing products:
* Strong object oriented programming fundamentals in Java
* Spring Boot, Hibernate (or equivalent) experience
* Relational Database Design and SQL optimisation
* Testing, monitoring and troubleshooting
* Ability to design and build backend systems that can scale both in supported features and concurrent usage
* Previous experience with Golang and/or Typescript is a bonus
* Experience with owning features end\\-to\\-end, from idea to execution to delivery in production
* Experience with communicating software design ideas and adapting to feedback before jumping into coding
* Extensive experience with AI\\-powered engineering tools (Cursor, Claude), you know their strengths, weaknesses, and how to validate outputs.



  





**Preferred (bonus)** 



* Experience working at fully remote companies
* Experience working on early stage startups
* Built functional AI features (especially if deployed to production) or integrated AI with backend systems.
* 0\\.5\\-1 year of software engineering experience in top tier tech companies (FAANG, Uber, Atlassian or similar), hedge funds (Towers Research, DE Shaw or similar) or VC\\-funded startups.



  





 Not every candidate will tick every box. If you are excited about our mission and believe you have what it takes to succeed with us, we want to hear from you!

**A US\\-based, venture\\-funded company transforming eCommerce visuals with AI\\-powered bulk photo editing is Looking for:******
**🎯 Role Overview**
* Build and own AI\\-backed features end to end, from ideation to production — including layout logic, smart cropping, visual enhancement, out\\-painting and GenAI workflows for background fills
* Design scalable APIs that wrap vision models like BiRefNet, YOLOv8, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, ControlNet, etc., into batch and real\\-time pipelines.
* Write production\\-grade Python code to manipulate and transform image data using NumPy, OpenCV (cv2\\), PIL, and PyTorch.
* Handle pixel\\-level transformations — from custom masks and color space conversions to geometric warps and contour ops — with speed and precision.
* Integrate your models into our production web app (AWS based Python/Java backend) and optimize them for latency, memory, and throughput
* Frame problems when specs are vague — you’ll help define what “good” looks like, and then build it
* Collaborate with product, UX, and other engineers without relying on formal handoffs — you own your domain


**What You’ll Need**
* 2–3 years of hands\\-on experience with vision and image generation models such as YOLO, Grounding DINO, SAM, CLIP, Stable Diffusion, VITON, or TryOnGAN — including experience with inpainting and outpainting workflows using Stable Diffusion pipelines (e.g., Diffusers, InvokeAI, or custom\\-built solutions)
* Strong hands\\-on knowledge of NumPy, OpenCV, PIL, PyTorch, and image visualization/debugging techniques.
* 1–2 years of experience working with popular LLM APIs such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and how to compose multi\\-modal pipelines
* Solid grasp of production model integration — model loading, GPU/CPU optimization, async inference, caching, and batch processing.
