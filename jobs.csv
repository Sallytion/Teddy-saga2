 Based in San Francisco, California, Turing is the world's leading research accelerator for frontier AI labs and a trusted partner for global enterprises deploying advanced AI systems. Turing supports customers in two ways: first, by accelerating frontier research with high\\-quality data, advanced training pipelines, plus top AI researchers who specialize in coding, reasoning, STEM, multilinguality, multimodality, and agents; and second, by applying that expertise to help enterprises transform AI from proof of concept into proprietary intelligence with systems that perform reliably, deliver measurable impact, and drive lasting results on the P\\&L.
   

  

**About The Role**
 As a Software Engineering evaluator at Turing, you will play a crucial role in advancing the capabilities of large language models by creating and refining high\\-quality datasets for training and benchmarking. Your primary responsibility will involve working closely with researchers to curate code examples, provide precise solutions, and make necessary corrections across multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript (with ReactJS), C/C\\+\\+, Java, Rust, and Go. You will evaluate AI\\-generated code for efficiency, scalability, and reliability, ensuring that models meet industry standards. Additionally, you will collaborate with cross\\-functional teams to develop enterprise\\-level AI\\-driven coding solutions, build verification agents, and hypothesize on various stages of the software engineering cycle to assess model performance and capabilities.
   

  

**Qualifications**
 The ideal candidate will possess several years of software engineering experience, including at least two years of continuous full\\-time experience at a top\\-tier product company such as Google, Stripe, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Netflix, Microsoft, Datadog, Dropbox, Shopify, PayPal, or IBM Research. Strong expertise in building full\\-stack applications and deploying scalable, production\\-grade software using modern languages and tools is essential. Candidates should have a deep understanding of software architecture, design principles, development processes, debugging techniques, and code review standards. Excellent oral and written communication skills are required to articulate evaluation rationales clearly and effectively. A proactive attitude towards problem\\-solving and the ability to work collaboratively in a fast\\-paced environment are also important.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Curate and build code examples for AI model training, including developing solutions and correcting code snippets in multiple programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, C/C\\+\\+, Java, Rust, and Go.
* Evaluate and refine AI\\-generated code to ensure it is efficient, scalable, and reliable, aligning with industry benchmarks and standards.
* Collaborate with research and engineering teams to enhance AI\\-driven coding solutions, providing insights and feedback to improve model performance.
* Design and implement verification mechanisms that automatically assess the quality of code solutions and identify error patterns.
* Hypothesize on various phases of the software engineering lifecycle, including prototyping, architecture design, API development, production deployment, experiments, monitoring, and maintenance, to evaluate model capabilities across these stages.
* Work on building agents capable of verifying code quality and detecting errors, contributing to the robustness of AI models in software engineering tasks.


**Benefits**
 While this role is offered on a flexible contractual basis, it provides an excellent opportunity to engage with cutting\\-edge AI research and contribute to impactful projects. The engagement requires a minimum commitment of 10 hours per week, with the possibility of increasing to up to 40 hours per week, depending on availability and project needs. The position offers flexibility in scheduling, allowing you to balance work with other commitments. Although this is a contractor role without medical or paid leave benefits, it provides valuable experience in the rapidly evolving field of AI and software engineering. You will have the chance to work alongside top researchers and engineers, gaining insights into the latest advancements and contributing to innovative solutions that shape the future of AI\\-driven software development.
