 Overjoy is building Sales AI for wholesale commerce. Our mission is to enable 10× sales teams by bringing modern software and AI to a long\\-underserved industry: B2B sales for consumer brands.
 



 Over 500 modern brands like Tipsy Elves, P.F. Candle Co., and David Protein use Overjoy to run wholesale. Our customers use Overjoy to find new prospects, run email campaigns, send samples, manage accounts, drive reorders, and scale revenue — all without the bloat of legacy platforms.
 



 We’re backed by Bessemer, OSV, Floodgate, and the founders of Thumbtack, Alloy, and Unsupervised — and 6 of our own customers invested after using the product.
 



  





 The Role
 



 We’re hiring an Integrations Engineer to help us rapidly build and maintain third\\-party integrations across the Overjoy platform.
 



 You’ll work within an existing codebase and follow established patterns to ship integrations quickly and reliably.
 



 You’ll be joining a small, fast\\-moving team and will work closely with backend engineers and founders — but you won’t be expected to own the entire architecture or redesign systems from scratch.
 



  





 What You’ll Work On
 


* Build new third\\-party integrations using existing patterns in our codebase (e.g. QuickBooks, WooCommerce, NetSuite, ShipStation, etc.)
* Implement authentication flows (OAuth, API keys, tokens)
* Map external platform data into existing internal schemas
* Implement and run data sync logic (initial backfills \\+ incremental updates)
* Debug and fix integration bugs caused by API changes, edge cases, or data mismatches
* Monitor integration health and help maintain data integrity
* Create lightweight internal documentation and troubleshooting notes for integrations



 You Might Be a Fit If You…
 


* Have experience building and maintaining production integrations with third\\-party platforms (commerce, accounting, payments, CRM, etc.)
* Are comfortable working in an existing codebase and extending established patterns
* Can read API documentation and turn it into working code quickly
* Enjoy execution\\-heavy, detail\\-oriented engineering work
* Are pragmatic, reliable, and focused on shipping



 Required Experience \\& Skills
 


* Strong backend fundamentals
* Experience with Python, Node.js, Postgres
* Experience working with REST APIs and authentication (OAuth / API keys)
* Experience with background jobs, async processing, and data backfills



 Nice to Have
 


* Experience with webhooks
* Familiarity with GCP (Cloud Run, Pub/Sub)
* Prior work on integrations with accounting or commerce platforms



 Why Overjoy?
 



 Build for a real problem
 



 B2B Commerce is massive, complex, and underserved. Our customers rely on integrations to run their businesses — and your work will directly unblock them.
 



  





 Work on software that actually ships
 



 This role is about real production systems used daily by hundreds of brands.
 



  





 Fast\\-growing company
 



 We’ve doubled revenue recently and are scaling quickly — and integrations are critical to that growth.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/overjoy-ai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHGe__vPdNq6g/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1736198795352/overseeshop_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=2xazAVAYu1rrdLvCPA_qCxdb0bG6r01Hr8DC7hfsP3k","","","","","","","","","","",""
