These improvements directly impact product time\\-to\\-market and customer satisfaction. Historically, software deployment timelines have been delayed by conventional coding methods, with approximately 30% of projects running behind schedule due to inefficiencies and defects.
   

  

 IgniteTech is at the helm of this transformation, embedding cutting\\-edge GenAI technologies to reshape software architecture and development practices. This position moves beyond incremental optimization and instead provides the unique opportunity to spearhead strategic AI\\-driven initiatives.

 This role is built for individuals who seek to operate at the forefront of technological innovation. It is not a task\\-execution or operational position; rather, it is a strategic role centered on extensive research and development, prototyping, and the deployment of AI to build next\\-generation software solutions. We seek candidates who not only possess deep expertise in AI and software architecture but also bring a visionary mindset to applying technology for business transformation.
   

  

 In this capacity, you will guide our team in defining the architectural frameworks and strategies that embed AI throughout our software offerings. Your contributions will be central to our mission, directly shaping the productivity and quality of our output. We welcome you to apply if you are eager to challenge technological limits and create measurable impact in the software industry.

* Routine Code Maintenance: Performing regular updates or debugging of existing codebases to address minor bugs or enhance functionality.
* Standard Software Development: Executing basic development tasks that involve implementing simple features or functionalities without the integration of AI.


**Lead AI Engineer Key Responsibilities**
* Apply your engineering expertise to achieve substantial gains in development velocity, reduction in human errors, and elevation of code quality, driving faster product time\\-to\\-market and improved customer satisfaction.
