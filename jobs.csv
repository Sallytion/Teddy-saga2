* Review and refine realistic coding tasks based on provided production codebases with realistic scope, requirements and information sources
* Write comprehensive functional tests that validate actual end\\-to\\-end behavior and edge\\-cases, not just superficial checks
* Craft ""fair but hard"" challenges where the AI has all the context it needs, but has to work for it (information scattered across files and external sources, complex reasoning required)
* Analyze AI failures to understand what the model struggles with vs. what it masters
* Iterate based on feedback from expert QA reviewers who score your work on 7 quality criteria


**What We Look For**

* Background in Full\\-Stack development, with an equal focus on building React\\-based interfaces and robust Back\\-end systems
* Experience writing tests (functional, integration \\- not just running them)
* Docker containers (running evaluations locally in containers)
* CI/CD understanding (GitHub Actions as a user: triggers, labels, reading results)
