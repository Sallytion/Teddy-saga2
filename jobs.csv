 The Infrastructure team under Apstra owns and evolves the backend infrastructure for Apstra.
   

  

**Join a team where systems and data engineering converge**
 You'll work at the core of a high\\-performance, custom\\-built infrastructure platform—while also helping shape the data pipelines that power our next\\-gen cloud analytics stack. This role offers rare dual exposure: from low\\-level optimization in performance\\-critical systems, to hands\\-on feature development in in\\-house time\\-series and graph databases. You’ll contribute to building and refining connectivity for these databases to the cloud, driving real\\-world data flows across hybrid environments. If you're excited by deep infrastructure, data\\-intensive workloads, and full\\-stack thinking, this is where your impact multiplies.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* Core Infrastructure (60% of Role)
* Maintains and enhances the backend platform that powers Apstra’s configuration, telemetry, and analytics pipeline.
* Owns:
+ Product packaging, upgrades, and deployment orchestration
+ Homegrown file\\-based telemetry database (custom\\-built, optimized for performance)
+ Distributed querying, data merging, system calls, IPC
+ Python \\+ C\\+\\+ hybrid execution, including C\\-extensions for performance

* Data Engineering (40% of Role)
* Enables data synchronization from on\\-prem Apstra to on JCloud.
* Constructs data pipelines and ETL flows to prepare, transform, and deliver telemetry for downstream cloud analytics consumers.
* Owns cloud enablement and sync logic (e.g. examples datasets, format normalization, usage signals).


**Why Candidates Should Join This Team**
 You’ll Build Real Infrastructure—Not Just Configure It
   

  

 This isn’t “infra as code”—it’s infrastructure as a product. You’ll design, scale, and optimize distributed systems that support real\\-time, multi\\-version enterprise network workloads across campus, data center, and WAN fabrics. It’s infrastructure that directly powers next\\-gen cloud analytics.
   

  

**Hybrid Challenge: On\\-Prem Meets Cloud**
 Few roles offer this blend: deep low\\-level systems work coupled with forward\\-looking data engineering. You'll help bridge Apstra’s on\\-prem legacy with its evolving cloud\\-native future, working across environments to modernize and integrate.
   

  

 Deep Ownership \\+ Technical Core
   

  

 This team doesn’t just connect APIs. It owns the architecture behind Apstra’s analytics and telemetry engines—critical infrastructure that underpins Juniper’s most advanced networking insights.
   

  

**Custom Database Engineering \\+ Analytics Edge**
 You’ll work directly on our in\\-house telemetry database, focusing on:
   

  

* Compression, distributed query execution, and performance tuning
* Building feature enhancements for in\\-house time\\-series and graph databases
* Enabling cloud connectivity and insights generation for real\\-world data use cases


**Cloud**
 You'll get early exposure to JCloud, our internal cloud platform. Think AWS\\-like building blocks—serverless functions, ETL pipelines, distributed stores—but tuned for networking workloads, security, and high observability.
   

  

**What You Need To Bring**
***Education and Experience Required:***
* Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, or equivalent.
* Typically 4\\-6 years experience.

A Staff Engineer at slice is an innovative, quality focused, product minded engineer who cares deeply about building reliable systems at scale. You think in systems, you understand technical context, and you use your experience to shape strong engineering outcomes across teams. You’ll be involved in most major technical initiatives, influence engineering culture, and help move the organisation in the right direction.
 



  





 You will work closely with Design, Product, Data Science, and Analytics teams to design and develop backend microservices that power critical user and payment experiences across slice.
 



  





**What you will do** 



* Lead engineering and technology best practices across quality, performance, design, and operations at an organisational level.
* Architect and deliver features or entire components with high ownership, whether you're strengthening onboarding flows in the Activation and Acquisitions pod or building ultra reliable money movement systems in the App Payments pod.
* Drive technical innovation and push the boundaries of how we design and scale large distributed systems across identity, onboarding, or payments domains.
* Collaborate with cross functional teams to ship end to end features, from critical user entry journeys in A2 to time sensitive, customer facing payment paths in App Payments.
* Prioritise effectively and switch contexts across domains as requirements evolve.
* Estimate project efforts accurately, identify risks early, propose solutions, and consistently meet delivery timelines.
* Lead design, functional, and code review cycles and ensure timely closure of all outstanding issues.
* Mentor and coach engineers, enabling them to grow while shaping the technical direction of whichever pod you anchor.
* Take a systems level view to understand how changes in onboarding, identity, payments, or compliance ripple across the product.
* Contribute to defining and evolving the long term technical vision, whether that means making onboarding smoother and more secure or making payments boringly reliable at scale.
* Improve hiring processes and help bring top tier engineers into the organisation.
* Represent your team and slice in internal and external engineering forums.



  





**What you will need** 



* 8\\+ years of strong design and development experience building large scale distributed systems and internet products.
* Deep expertise in modern technology stacks and experience across multiple languages or backend ecosystems.
* Ability to write maintainable, scalable, and unit testable code.
* Experience leading and mentoring engineering teams or project groups.
* Strong object oriented skills, knowledge of design patterns, and the ability to design intuitive modules and class level interfaces.
* Deep understanding of data driven web application design and development.
* Strong organisation, communication, interpersonal, and leadership skills.
* Proven performer who thrives in high energy, fast paced, product focused environments.
* Self starter who can operate with minimal guidance in a fluid environment.
* Ability to adapt quickly to changing requirements, scopes, and priorities.
* Contributions to open source or personal projects on GitHub are a strong plus.
* Prior experience in a fast paced product company.","Financial Services, Technology, Information and Media, and Internet Marketplace Platforms","https://in.linkedin.com/company/sliceit","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQEi-rAxkZrUWg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1667382231955?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=59M7gE_AVn0ZValc2qs4HnpZ2DSHMF3mHXNsNEppFQw","","","","","","","","","","",""
