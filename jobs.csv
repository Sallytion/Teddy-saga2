 Our product:
 


* **Farmony** 
 — a platform connecting farmers with farming equipment (and the people/services needed to get work done)



 We’re a small team that builds with intention: ship fast, talk to users often, and keep the product honest.
 


 Role
 
 We’re hiring a
 **Full Stack Intern (React Native \\+ NestJS)** 
 for a
 **6\\-month** 
 internship to help build and improve Farmony end\\-to\\-end: mobile UI → APIs → data flow → reliability.
 



 This is not a “watch and learn” internship. You’ll ship real features with support, code reviews, and clear tasks. You’ll work closely with product \\+ engineering, and your work will land in production.
 



**Type:** 
 Internship (6 months, remote)
 



**Team:** 
 Early\\-stage, high\\-ownership, high\\-feedback
 


 What you’ll work on
 * Build mobile screens and flows in
 **React Native** 
 (navigation, forms, state, performance)
* Implement backend endpoints in
 **NestJS** 
 (controllers, services, validation, auth)
* Integrate mobile ↔ backend (API contracts, error handling, loading states)
* Improve product quality (bug fixes, edge cases, UX polish)
* Add basic observability (logs, metrics, monitoring) and write practical tests



 Example projects you might ship:
 


* Farmer onboarding \\+ profile setup
* Equipment listing flow (create/edit, photos, availability, pricing)
* Search \\+ filters (location, equipment type, availability window)
* Booking/request flow \\+ status tracking
* Backend cleanup to make APIs consistent and safe


 What we’re looking for
 * Comfortable with
 **JavaScript/TypeScript**
* Some experience with
 **React Native** 
 (projects, coursework, hackathons all count)
* Some experience with
 **Node.js** 
 and interest in
 **NestJS** 
 (or willing to learn fast)
* Understands basics: REST APIs, async, Git, debugging
* Communicates clearly and takes feedback well


 Bonus (not required)
 * Experience with
 **Postgres** 
 , Prisma/TypeORM, or MongoDB
* Familiarity with mobile performance, caching, or offline\\-first patterns
* Interest in marketplaces, logistics, or payments
* Experience shipping anything used by real people


 Why this is a good place to intern
 * **Real mentorship:** 
 reviews that teach, not just “LGTM”
* **High trust:** 
 you’ll own features, not just tickets
* **Clean engineering habits:** 
 readable code, practical tests, no spaghetti
* **User proximity:** 
 you’ll see real user feedback and why changes matter
* **No corporate theater:**
