**LLM Integration \\& Optimization** 



* Integrate with LLM platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic) or self\\-hosted models (Llama, Mistral), including prompt engineering, fine\\-tuning, and model evaluation.
* Experience with AI orchestration tools (LangFlow, Flowise), multimodal models, or AI safety and evaluation frameworks.



**AI Infrastructure \\& Observability** 



* Develop scalable AI pipelines with proper monitoring, evaluation metrics, and observability to ensure reliability in production environments.



  





**End\\-to\\-End Integration \\& Rapid Prototyping** 



* Connect AI backends to user\\-facing applications; prototype new AI features quickly using frontend frameworks (React/Next.js).



  





**Cross\\-Functional Collaboration** 





 Partner with product managers, designers, and fellow engineers to translate complex business requirements into robust AI solutions.
 




  






 You’ll Thrive in This Role If You…
 



* Have 3–5 years of experience building production AI/ML systems at a consulting or product\\-engineering firm.
* Possess deep understanding of transformer architectures, vector embeddings, and semantic search.
* Are hands\\-on with vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma) and RAG pipelines.
