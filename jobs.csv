**Work Mode:** 
 WFH (Welcome to WFO if you’re in Hyderabad)
 



  






 We’re 
 
**ZocialOne** 

 , building the future of social media marketing. We believe small businesses shouldn’t need agencies, designers, or marketers to grow online. We build AI\\-powered marketing software that helps businesses create, schedule, and manage content across Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Business, and more — all from one place.
 




  






 This isn’t a demo app or a prototype. We run a

 ·       Strong sense of UI/UX polish
 





 ·       Experience with charts or analytics visualizations
 





 ·       Curiosity about performance optimization
 





 ·       Interest in how production apps scale
 




  





**What We Expect from You** 





 We’re not a 9\\-to\\-5 or task\\-ticket culture. We move fast, build fast, and fix fast.
 





 ·       Take ownership of the work you do
 





 ·       Learn quickly and figure things out independently
 





 ·       Care deeply about product quality — performance, UI, and UX
 





 ·       Be open to feedback and iteration
 





 ·       Step up when things need fixing
 




  





**You’ll learn by doing and taking ownership, supported by the team whenever you need help.**

 ﻿
 
 👉
 **High\\-performing interns will be considered for full\\-time roles** 
 based on ownership, execution, and impact.
 



  





**Not a Fit If** 





 ·       You need micromanagement
 





 ·       You want a slow or comfortable environment
 





 ·       You prefer bureaucracy over building
 




  





**In short** 





 If you want to learn by building, work on a 
 
**production Flutter Web app** 

 , and grow fast in a startup where your work genuinely matters —
