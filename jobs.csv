Founded in 2014 by Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar with a simple vision — to simplify payments for Indian businesses — we’ve since grown into a fintech powerhouse driving India’s digital payment revolution.
 



 Razorpay powers millions of businesses with a smarter, scalable stack that goes beyond transactions to help them truly build and grow.
 



 From seamless checkouts to payroll automation, across India, Singapore, and Malaysia, we’ve been engineering a fintech ecosystem that’s redefining how money moves across Asia — and we’re just getting started.
 



 Today, that ecosystem supports everyone from early\\-stage startups to some of India’s largest enterprises, enabling them to accept, process, and disburse payments at scale while expanding into new ways of managing money more efficiently.
 



 Our scale speaks volumes: Razorpay processes $180\\+ billion in annualized transactions, powering leading businesses like Airbnb, Facebook, WhatsApp, Airtel, CRED, BookmyShow, Zomato, Swiggy, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension Scheme — and over 100 of India’s unicorns. With strong roots in India and growing operations in Southeast Asia, we are shaping the next chapter of financial technology across the region.
 



 We are backed by global investors including GIC, Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India \\& SEA), Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, MasterCard, and Salesforce Ventures, having raised over $740 million to date. Strategic acquisitions — including Ezetap (POS and offline payments), Curlec (Malaysia expansion), BillMe (digital invoicing), and POP (rewards\\-first UPI) — along with earlier moves in fraud prevention, payroll, and lending, have further strengthened our platform and widened our footprint across Asia.
 



 But what truly sets Razorpay apart is our culture. At Razorpay, ownership is our oxygen — you own what you build, with no micromanagement or red tape, just the runway to make your ideas fly. Learning is a lifestyle — if you’re curious, you’ll feel at home here. People \\> Pedigree — we hire for attitude, hustle, and hunger more than degrees. Transparency thrives over titles — this is where interns question CXOs and CXOs say “thank you.” Guided by our values of Customer First, Autonomy \\& Ownership, Agility with Integrity, Transparency, Challenging the status quo and a strong belief that Razorpay grows with Razors, you’ll be part of a 3000\\+ strong team building not just products, but the financial infrastructure of the future.

You’re expected to be involved in almost every project and also influence the culture of the company and help shape it in the right way.

**MostEdge Technology** 
 :
 **A Platform Built for Scale, Integrity, and Performance** 
 MostEdge is building a spine\\-centered, enterprise\\-of\\-enterprises retail intelligence platform designed to power multi\\-store retailers, enterprise chains, franchise groups, and large B2B organizations. We are not building CRUD APIs. We are building distributed systems that must be correct, fast, resilient, and evolvable. If you are excited by event\\-driven architectures, multi\\-tenant SaaS, and high\\-scale distributed platforms — this is your opportunity.
 



  





**The Role** 




  





**Design and Build Platform\\-Level Backend Systems As a Senior Backend Engineer(Java),** 




  





 you will design and implement domain services that power the MostEdge Platform Spine. This is not feature\\-layer development. This is infrastructure level backend engineering. You will help shape how the platform evolves — not just implement tickets.
 



  





**What You Will Build** 




  





**Distributed Domain Services** 
 You will design services that enforce clear ownership boundaries and publish reliable, versioned domain events. Your systems will integrate into an event backbone where correctness and replay safety matter.
 



  





**Event\\-Driven Data Flows** 
 You will implement reliable event publishing and idempotent consumption patterns. Your services will operate within a distributed author–subscriber model that ensures projection rebuilding, safe replay, and system decoupling.
 



  





**High\\-Performance Read Models** 
 You will help design projection\\-driven read paths optimized for low\\-latency responses. Dashboards must remain fast regardless of time range — and your design choices will make that possible. Multi\\-Tenant Enforcement You will build context\\-aware services that enforce strict tenant boundaries and role\\-based access across enterprises, retailers, stores, and endpoints.
 



  





**Elastic Lifecycle Awareness** 
 You will ensure services behave safely across tenant states such as provisioning, active, parked, or suspended — without compromising data integrity or platform stability.
 



  





**Core Responsibilities** 




  





**Architectural Ownership** 
 You are responsible for designing services that align with platform principles — single writer ownership, contract\\-first APIs, event propagation, and tenant isolation.
 



  





**Distributed Systems Engineering** 
 You will build services that operate reliably across multiple environments, handle replay safely, and scale horizontally without tight coupling.
 



  





**Performance Discipline** 
 You will engineer systems that meet strict latency targets and avoid performance anti patterns such as runtime joins in high\\-traffic paths.
 



  





**Operational Excellence** 
 You will write observable services, emit structured telemetry, and contribute to system hardening and resilience efforts.
 



  





**What You Bring** 




  





**Required Experience You have 6\\+ years of backend engineering\\- Java** 
 experience and have built distributed systems in production environments. You understand event\\-driven architecture, idempotency, and scalable API design. You have strong experience with relational databases and have operated within multi\\-tenant SaaS systems. You are comfortable working with systems that prioritize architectural integrity over shortcuts.
 



  





**Strongly Preferred Experience E** 
 xperience with OLAP systems, Kubernetes\\-based services, high\\-volume transactional platforms, schema evolution without downtime, subscription/entitlement systems, or retail/fintech\\-scale systems will make you especially effective in this role.
 



  





**What Success Looks Like** 




  





**First 90 Days** 
 You ship a production\\-grade domain service aligned with platform standards. Your service publishes reliable events and integrates cleanly into the projection and analytics pipelines.
 







**First 6 Months** 
 You influence architectural decisions, improve measurable performance paths, and contribute to system stability under peak load. You become a trusted contributor to distributed system design across the platform.
 



  





**Why Join MostEdge** 




  





**Build Systems That Matter** 
 This is an opportunity to work on a serious distributed SaaS platform built for scale and longevity. You will work alongside engineers who care deeply about architecture, correctness, and performance. If you want to design systems that enterprises rely on — and help shape a platform that scales across thousands of stores — this is the place to do it.
