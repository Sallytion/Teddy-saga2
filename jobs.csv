 SAS 9\\.4 Administration Skill Set
   

  

 This is the classic SAS Administrator role. Mastery here involves understanding the interconnected components of the SAS 9\\.4 platform.
   

  

 Key Tools \\& Concepts:
   

  

* SAS Management Console (SMC): This is your primary tool. You must be an expert in it. Metadata Management: Creating and managing users, groups, roles, and logins. Security: Defining and managing Access Control Templates (ACTs) to secure folders, tables, and other metadata objects. Library Management: Defining SAS librefs for databases, SAS datasets, and other data sources. Server Management: Defining and configuring SAS servers (Workspace, Stored Process, Pooled Workspace).
* SAS Environment Manager: The web\\-based application for monitoring platform health. Monitoring resource usage (CPU, Memory, I/O). Managing services and viewing log files. Defining alerts and notifications.
* Operating System \\& Scripting: Server Management: Starting and stopping all SAS services in the correct order using the provided scripts. Scripting (Bash/Shell, PowerShell): Automating administrative tasks like log cleanup, backups, and monitoring. File System Management: Understanding the SAS directory structure (SAS\\-CONFIG, SAS\\-HOME), managing permissions, and monitoring disk space, especially for SASWORK.
* Troubleshooting: Log Analysis: Knowing where to find and how to interpret logs for the Object Spawner, Web Application Server (e.g., SASServer1\\_1\\), and Workspace Servers. This is a critical skill for debugging user issues.
* Deployment \\& Maintenance: Using the SAS Deployment Manager to apply hotfixes, renew licenses (SETINIT), and add new SAS products. Understanding backup and recovery strategies, especially for the SAS Metadata Server.


 General Skills
   

  

 These are the foundational skills that bridge both platforms.
   

  

* Authentication \\& Security: Deep understanding of how SAS integrates with enterprise identity providers like LDAP or Active Directory. Experience configuring single sign\\-on (SSO) is a major plus.
* Networking: Solid knowledge of ports, firewalls, DNS, load balancers, and HTTPS/TLS. You will constantly be troubleshooting connectivity issues.
* Storage: Understanding of shared file systems (like NFS) is critical, as both platforms rely on it for configuration, user homes, and data access.
* Problem\\-Solving: A systematic, analytical approach to troubleshooting is the most important skill. You need to be able to isolate a problem (Is it the user? The client? The network? The mid\\-tier? The back\\-end?) by effectively using logs and monitoring tools.
* Communication: The ability to clearly communicate with end\\-users (analysts, data scientists), developers, and other IT infrastructure teams.


 For a job application, you should clearly separate your experience on your resume, perhaps with a ""SAS 9\\.4 Administration"" section and a ""SAS Viya 3\\.5 Administration"" section, highlighting the specific tools and accomplishments for each.
   

  

**Required Qualifications To Be Successful In This Role**
 skill : SAS admin, SAS Viya 3\\.5
   

  

 Exp : 5 to 8 yrs
