 Turing is one of the world’s fastest\\-growing AI companies accelerating the advancement and deployment of powerful AI systems.
 



 Turing helps customers in two ways: Working with the world’s leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, multilinguality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and leveraging that work to build real\\-world AI systems that solve mission\\-critical priorities for companies.
 



  





**Role Overview** 




 We are seeking candidates with experience in any programming language or tech stacks to validate and ensure the quality of training data used in developing agentic AI systems. This role involves working with function\\-calling methods to create structured tasks, ensuring data workflows remain consistent, accurate, and aligned with cutting\\-edge AI requirements.
 



  





**What does day\\-to\\-day look like?** 



* Validate large\\-scale training datasets and maintain strict quality standards.
* Create, manipulate, and structure JSON tasks for function\\-calling workflows.
* Work closely with AI researchers and teams to align datasets with agentic AI use cases.
* Monitor data accuracy, consistency, and integrity across projects.
* Contribute to documentation and best practices for dataset preparation and validation.



  





**Requirements** 



* Strong proficiency in
 **Python or JavaScript or Java or any other programming languages** 
 for data handling and workflow automation.
* Solid understanding of
 **SQL** 
 for querying and managing datasets.
* Expertise or Knowledge in handling
 **JSON** 
 .
* Exceptional attention to detail with a focus on data quality and consistency.
* Interest in or exposure to
 **agentic AI, LLMs, or NLP best practices** 
 .
* Bonus: Prior experience with
 **data annotation tools** 
 or
 **prompt engineering** 
 for Agent AI.



  





**Perks of Freelancing With Turing** 



* Work in a fully remote environment.
* Opportunity to work on cutting\\-edge AI projects with leading LLM companies.



  





**Offer Details** 



* **Commitments Required:**
