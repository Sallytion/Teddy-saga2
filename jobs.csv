**Hiring Partner:** 
 Canvas Labs (on behalf of a Stealth Startup)
 



**Location:** 
 Remote
 



**Experience:** 
 3–6 Years
 



**Compensation:** 
 ₹30 – 40 LPA
 



  





**The Short Story** 




 We are
 **Canvas Labs** 
 , and we’re helping build the founding tech team for a
 **stealth startup** 
 set to disrupt the
 **Consumer AI** 
 space.
 



 A bit about the team:
 **Ex–IIT Delhi** 
 , with leadership experience across strategy and engineering at world\\-class firms. Now they’re coming together—
 **Avengers\\-style** 
 —to build the next big category\\-defining product.
 



 We can’t tell you exactly what we’re building yet (shhh), but we
 *can* 
 tell you this: it’s a
 **mobile\\-first consumer product** 
 designed to bring Generative AI into daily life in a way that feels like
 **magic** 
 , not “tech.”
 



 We’re looking for a
 **Product Engineer** 
 who blends deep engineering fundamentals with sharp product sense—someone who can ship fast, debug hard problems, and build systems that feel invisible to the user.
 



  





**The Mission** 




 Most AI products today feel like
 *tools* 
 . We want to build a
 **companion** 
 .
 



 That means the engineering has to be solid enough to handle real\\-world consumer scale, while the product experience feels effortless. Your job is to build the underlying product systems—
 **APIs, workflows, data, reliability, performance** 
 —that make the AI feel instant, intuitive, and trustworthy.
 



  





**What You’ll Do (The 0 → 1 Journey)** 




**1\\) Ship End\\-to\\-End (Ownership is non\\-negotiable)** 



* Take features from idea → scope → build → test → deploy → monitor
* Own production quality: you don’t vanish when things break
* Build with the mindset of
 **real users \\+ real edge cases**



  





**2\\) Engineering Fundamentals (Clean code, tests, debugging)** 



* Write
 **clean, maintainable, testable** 
 code
* Add
 **unit tests** 
 for core logic and prevent regressions
* Debug effectively across app \\+ APIs \\+ integrations \\+ production logs
* Be strong at fundamentals even in an era of AI\\-assisted coding



  





**3\\) System Design for Consumer AI** 



* Design and build
 **APIs, services, and data models** 
 that scale
* Work comfortably with
 **databases, caching, queues/background jobs**
* Make smart architectural calls: reliability, latency, performance, cost
* Build guardrails: retries, rate limits, fallbacks, observability



  





**4\\) Product Thinking (Solve the right problem)** 



* Understand the user problem before jumping into solutions
* Turn ambiguity into clarity: ask sharp questions, define scope
* Always think in
 **user outcomes** 
 , not just feature delivery
* Improve product experience by noticing friction and proposing fixes



  





**5\\) Judgment \\& Business Context** 



* Know when to build fast vs build right
* Avoid over\\-engineering when speed matters—and under\\-engineering when it will hurt later
* Think clearly about trade\\-offs: third\\-party services, cost, and complexity



  





**Who You Are?** 




**The Experience** 



* 3–6 years building product systems in fast\\-moving environments
* You’ve shipped features that faced real users, real bugs, real scale



  





**The Essentials** 



* Strong fundamentals: code quality, testing, debugging
* Solid understanding of system design basics: APIs, databases, architecture
* Comfortable with ambiguous requirements and moving targets
* Strong communication with founders/stakeholders (clarity \\> jargon)



  





**Good to Have** 



* Experience with mobile\\-first consumer products (or working closely with mobile teams)
* Experience with event\\-driven systems / queues / background processing
* Familiarity with LLM/GenAI product patterns (trust, latency, streaming, memory, safety, feedback loops)
* Strong product instincts: you care deeply about UX outcomes even when writing backend code



  





**Why You Should Join?** 



* **The Pedigree:** 
 Work alongside alumni from IIT Delhi and leaders with experience at top strategy/engineering organizations. This is a masterclass in execution.
* **The Impact:** 
 You’re not Employee \\#500\\. You’re a founding engineer. Your decisions will shape the product’s DNA.
* **The Problem:** 
 Consumer AI is a new frontier—mobile\\-first, real\\-time, trust\\-driven. Hard and exciting.
* **The Compensation:** 
 ₹24 – 30 LPA for top talent who can truly own outcomes.



  





**The Selection Process** 




 We know strong engineers are busy. We’ve designed a process that respects your time while still testing what matters.
 



**1\\) Application \\+ Small Assignment** 




 Fill out the form and complete a short assignment.
 



**2\\) Technical \\+ Ownership Round** 




 Walk through your thinking. Expect debugging, trade\\-offs, and system design fundamentals.
 



**3\\) Founder Conversation** 




 Deep\\-dive on how you operate in 0→1 ambiguity, execution mindset, and product instincts.
 



 Ready to build the future of Consumer AI?
