 Visit First: https://dailyaffairs.org
 



  





 The Daily Affairs is an AI\\-powered media platform delivering real\\-time news, culture, and insights with speed and clarity. Our automation stack collects and cleans headlines every few minutes, deduplicates content, and serves concise summaries that preserve context. Beyond breaking news, we’re building habit\\-forming features such as horoscopes and interactive explainers. Our mission is simple: keep people informed in less time, with less noise, because your time and the truth matter.
 



  





 Role Overview
 



 We’re hiring a software engineer to design, build, and optimise the intelligence layer that powers Daily Affairs—covering ingestion, deduplication, summarisation, ranking, safety, and analytics. You’ll collaborate with product and engineering teams to deliver measurable improvements in content quality, latency, and cost. This is a hands\\-on role: you’ll prototype quickly, run evaluations, and take models to production.
 



  





 What you’ll do
 



 • Ingestion \\& De\\-duplication: Design robust de\\-duplication methods (content hashing, fuzzy matching, URL canonicalisation) with measurable precision and recall; prevent near\\-duplicates across sources and languages.
 



 • Summarisation \\& Editing: Build and refine editors using LLMs (extractive/abstractive), enforce tone and style guides, and implement guardrails and citation/attribution logic.
 



 • Ranking \\& Personalisation (Phase 2\\): Deploy lightweight signals\\-based ranking; develop privacy\\-aware personalisation that respects editorial standards.
 



 • Safety \\& Quality: Implement prompt and output filters (toxicity, bias, PII leaks); develop red\\-team tests and automatic rollbacks on regression.
 



 • Evaluation \\& Observability: Develop offline and online evaluations (ROUGE/BLEU/BERTScore, human rubrics), dashboards for latency, cost per article, and hallucination rate; define “quality gates” before publishing.
 



 • MLOps: Productionise pipelines (batch and on\\-demand), version prompts and models, manage secrets, and optimise spend (token budgets, caching, distillation).
 



 • Collaboration: Turn editorial requirements into measurable specifications; run experiments with product and design teams; document decisions and handoffs.
 



  





 Success looks like (first 90 days)
 



 • p95 end\\-to\\-end summarisation latency \\< 2\\.0s (API to publish).
 



 • Duplicate articles reduced by ≥ 95% at publish time (measured by eval set).
 



 • Hallucination and regression rate \\< 3% on curated test set with human spot checks.
 



 • Cost per 1,000 summaries reduced by ≥ 30% through caching, prompt tuning, or model selection.
 



 • Evaluation tools and dashboards are live; weekly quality reports are adopted by the team.
 



  





 Required qualifications
 



 • 3\\+ years of experience working with ML/LLMs/NLP (or related portfolio): summarization, NER, topic tagging, semantic search, or ranking.
 



 • Proficiency in Python and the ML stack (PyTorch/Transformers or equivalent), prompt engineering, and evaluation methodologies.
 



 • Hands\\-on experience deploying AI models in production (APIs, retries, rate limiting, observability, cost management).
 



 • Comfort with REST, JSON, and integrating external news, RSS, or APIs.
 



 • Clear communicator capable of writing concise documentation and reasoning about trade\\-offs with product and editorial teams.
 



  





 Nice to have
 



 • Experience with media/news, trust \\& safety, or information quality.
 



 • Knowledge of vector search tools (pgvector/Pinecone), lightweight reranking, and feature stores.
 



 • Familiarity with Node.js/TypeScript (our app stack), n8n, or workflow engines.
 



 • Experience with A/B testing, bandit algorithms, and analytics platforms (GA4, Amplitude, Looker).
 



 • AWS experience (Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, SES) and database skills (PostgreSQL/Supabase, Redis caching).
 



  





 Our current stack (context)
 



 • App: React \\+ TypeScript (PWA), Node.js \\+ Express
 



 • Data: PostgreSQL (Supabase), Redis; optional Algolia search
 



 • Pipelines: n8n (ingest → process → publish), webhooks
 



 • AI: OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic APIs (model choice by use case), Transformers when needed
 



 • Infrastructure/Monitoring: AWS (S3, CloudFront, SES), GitHub Actions, GA4 with logs and metrics
 



  





 Compensation \\& Benefits
 



 • Competitive early\\-stage salary plus meaningful equity.
 



 • Remote\\-first, flexible hours, modern tooling budget.
 



 • High ownership: shape the product, roadmap, and standards from day one.
 



  





 How to apply
 



 Send your LinkedIn or GitHub profile along with a brief note on a shipped AI feature you’re proud of (including the problem, constraints, and measurable outcomes). Bonus: include a quick take on evaluating news summaries for accuracy.
