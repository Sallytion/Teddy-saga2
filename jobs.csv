 We are seeking an experienced database professional with 10\\+ years of hands\\-on experience working with large\\-scale, highly available, distributed production database systems deployed in cloud environments. The ideal candidate will possess a deep technical background, a passion for innovation, and a history of developing robust service\\-oriented architectures and RESTful web services.
   

  

**What is IAM at OCI?**
 Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows users to control who has access to their cloud resources. As part of the Cloud Platform organization, the team is responsible for the design and build of core services that are utilized by internal and external customers alike.
   

  

 The Identity Control Plane team is primarily responsible for servicing CRUD API calls on all Identity\\-related entities like users, groups, policies, and compartments across all global regions while ensuring consistency and reliability.
   

  

**Who are we looking for?**
 We are looking for engineers with distributed systems experience. You should have experience with the design of major features and launching them into production. You’ve operated high\\-scale services and understand how to make them more resilient. You work on most projects and tasks independently.
   

  

 The ideal candidate will be technically strong and get a lot done – you’ve worked on services that are highly available, scalable, and redundant. You understand that simple systems are easier to operate and troubleshoot. You can balance speed and quality with iteration and incremental improvements. You’ve made life easier for other developers and have motivated your teams to make both process and service improvements with your ability to automate and instrument properly to get the right data.

**What are the biggest challenges for the team?**
 The biggest challenges for the team are reliability and performance. The growth of the business is driving us to improve the ability of our systems to scale out and handle traffic patterns that are several orders of magnitude greater than what we can support today.
   

  

 We understand that software is living and needs investment. The challenge is making the right tradeoffs, communicating those decisions effectively, and crisp execution.
   

  

 We need engineers who can build services that handle millions of requests per second. We need engineers who can figure out how we can survive regional data center outages and protect our customers. We need engineers who can build services that enable us to offer even more options to customers and contribute to the overall growth of Oracle Cloud.

 The Retail Business Services (RBS) Technology team's mission is to transform the Amazon's e\\-commerce business through technology, delivering order of magnitude higher speed, scale and impact. This Principal Engineer role leads a strong charter to accelerate business functions currently done manually, by envisioning and developing ML/GenAI\\-driven Agentic core platforms, thus enabling self\\-service building of agents to perform cognitive tasks autonomously.
   

  

 Providing a delightful experience to Amazon's e\\-commerce customers and selling partners requires thousands of various types of tasks performed by business teams that operate at the interface of the company as well at the heart of it. These teams work with vendors to source products to increase selection and choice for the customers, audit the app/website experience to ensure trustworthy information is provided to customers to enable confident purchases, learn from customer feedback on product reviews and returns, and ensure the inventory is placed at the right location for fast delivery of orders, just to name a few activities. Manual activities reduces speed of operations, introduce undesirable variations and limit scale. Hence there is a need to automate these, while overcoming the challenges of 1\\) task\\-by\\-task automation being inefficient, 2\\) human cognitive work automation requires equivalent or better intelligent systems, 3\\) a vast variety of business use cases, and 4\\) ability to integrate with the existing ecosystem of 100s of tools.
   

  

 The Principal Engineer owns the charter of defining and building these scalable platforms for automation, leveraging the state\\-of\\-the\\-art technologies such as GenAI and Agentic infrastructure. The role will understand the express and latent needs of the space, by working with business and product teams. Further, the role will define the core services and platforms that will enable rapid automation through leverage of ML/GenAI. These platforms will enable self\\-service, low\\-code/no\\-code automation by deskilling automation development. The Principal Engineer sets the right quality bar for resilience, latency, maintainability, accuracy (precision/recall), usability, security/privacy and efficiency, for the team to adhere to. The ideal candidate is one who thrives on understanding the complexity of software systems, and brings a nuanced understanding of different aspects of automation technologies spanning machine learning and big data processing. Working with the rest of the team, peers and stakeholders, they will lead the technology decisions to empower thousands of task automation, from simple few steps, to complex ones involving several tool integrations and conditional steps. The enormous challenge requires creative thinking and passion to use technology to make customers' and internal teams' lives better.
