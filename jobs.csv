 We’re building the Cursor for knowledge work—an enterprise AI platform that connects siloed data (SQL, files, SaaS apps) to governed, production\\-ready AI agents and workflows. Think: connectors, RBAC/OPA\\-style governance, evaluation, and embeddable chatbots for mid\\-market and enterprise customers—running on AWS with a modern, modular stack.
 



  




 The Role
 
  





 We’re hiring a product\\-minded Full\\-Stack Frontend Engineer to own major slices of our UI and edge APIs. You’ll lead development of our web app and embeddable chat experiences (SalesBot, Website AI Chatbot), craft delightful React/TypeScript interfaces, and wire them to AWS services (API Gateway/Lambda/ECS), DynamoDB and OpenSearch for speed at scale. You’ll work closely with founders and customers, ship fast, and set UI/UX and engineering standards for a multi\\-tenant, SOC\\-aware, enterprise product.
 



  




 What You’ll Do
 * Build core product UX: Dashboards, connectors gallery, agent/flow builders, Trust Center, evaluations, and analytics.
* Embeddable chat experiences: Create a first\\-class widget (iframe/JS SDK) with suggestion chips, lead\\-capture, and theming; integrate seamlessly into customer sites.
* Data plumbing from the client: Typed SDKs, TanStack Query data hooks, optimistic updates, error boundaries, and offline\\-tolerant flows.
* Own end\\-to\\-end features: React UI → typed APIs → AWS services → DynamoDB/OpenSearch queries and indices → metrics/observability.
* Performance \\& accessibility: Lighthouse\\-driven perf, a11y best practices, and design\\-system components.
* Reliability \\& security by default: Multi\\-tenant guardrails (RBAC/OPA\\-style), Cognito/OAuth flows, audit trails, and least\\-privilege patterns.
* Operational excellence: CI/CD pipelines, preview apps, feature flags, dashboards/alerts; instrument UX with analytics.



  




 Tech You’ll Use Here
 * Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite/Next.js, TanStack Query, Zustand/Redux, Tailwind/Chakra/Headless UI, Storybook, Vitest/Jest/RTL.
* Backend/Infra: AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, ECS Fargate, S3, CloudFront, EventBridge, SQS/SNS, CloudWatch), DynamoDB (PK/SK, GSIs, TTL), OpenSearch (mappings, analyzers, aggregations), Node.js.
* Platform \\& DevEx: Terraform/IaC, GitHub Actions, OpenAPI/JSON Schema, Sentry, Segment/Amplitude.



  




 Minimum Qualifications
 * 4\\+ years building production web apps with React and TypeScript.
* Strong UI engineering craft: component architecture, state management, forms, data fetching, routing, accessibility, testing.
* Experience designing and consuming typed HTTP APIs; comfortable shaping contracts and payloads.
* Solid AWS experience shipping user\\-facing features backed by API Gateway/Lambda/ECS.
* Practical NoSQL modeling with DynamoDB (PK/SK design, GSIs, conditional writes, pagination) and event\\-driven patterns.
* Hands\\-on with OpenSearch (index design, text analyzers, relevance tuning, filters/aggregations) or Elasticsearch.
* You ship: CI/CD, code reviews, testing culture, meaningful metrics.



  




 Nice to Have
 * Built embeddable widgets/SDKs adopted by external developer teams.
* Multi\\-tenant SaaS experience (RBAC, org scoping, audit logs, rate limiting).
* Cognito/OAuth/OIDC, JWT, and session management in SPAs.
* Familiarity with Bedrock/OpenAI gateways, prompt tooling, or LangGraph/LangChain.
* Storybook/Chromatic visual testing; design\\-system stewardship.
* Terraform on AWS; cost\\-aware design and observability.



  




 How We Work
 * Short planning cycles, crisp tickets, and demo\\-driven development.
* “You build it, you own it”: instrumentation, docs, and on\\-call within reason.
* Pragmatic, product\\-first mindset—bias to ship, measure, iterate.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/verity-labs-ai","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGo_JX-7bRNug/company-logo_100_100/B56ZbFGv23H0AU-/0/1747063602899/verity_labs_ai_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=9Au5CX8ZkTzgOQhngV_4EbpWH86ADJg9LGVBgpvWuoI","","","","","","","","","","",""
