 Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.
   

  

 In\\-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in\\-office workdays
   

  

**About The Role**
 Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. The Developer Experience team is responsible for architecting, implementing, and scaling the tools and frameworks that Notion developers use to build Notion. We are looking for engineers who are passionate about solving engineering productivity challenges, have deep empathy for other developers, and love to communicate with engineers. You don't need to have experience in this domain but willing to advocate for developer experience is the key.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* Collaborate with engineers across the company to deliver an industry\\-leading developer experience, along the way working deeply with tools like the TypeScript language server, lint tooling, and the Notion CLI to improve developers’ day to day experience.
* Work on the bleeding edge of tooling performance, researching and evaluating new tools and keeping up with new developments in the developer experience space in the JS ecosystem.
* Work deeply with GitHub and our CI systems to help ensure engineers can merge their code quickly and safely. We aim for all PR CI pipelines to finish within 15 minutes!
* Take ownership of our development environment and toolchain, and contribute to novel projects across the company to deliver impact.


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Over 8 years of hands\\-on software development experience, thriving in fast\\-paced and dynamic environments.
* A drive to make developers’ lives better: you have a strong interest in keeping engineers in their flow state through better tooling. You like to think critically about the workflows engineers use in their day to day work, finding bottlenecks and thinking outside of the box to find ways to pave a better golden path for engineers to follow.
* A focus on user experience: you bring care and craft to the user experience you build into your products. Your work emphasizes simplicity, supportability, and ease\\-of\\-use, and you communicate clearly with other teams and engineers to get feedback on where we can improve.
* Multitasker and present: you like interrupts especially if this is blocking engineers. You switch between your project work and day to day developer experience challenges.
* Interest in learning how things work: you love to learn how the tools you use work at a fundamental level. You get excited at the idea of digging into third\\-party source code to understand how they work and find new ways to use them.
* Pragmatic and business\\-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
* You don’t need to be an AI expert, but you’re curious and willing to adopt AI tools to work smarter and deliver better results.


**Nice To Haves**
* Familiarity with TypeScript, especially in ways to keep it running smoothly in a large codebase.
* An interest in automated testing and familiarity with testing best practices.
* Past experience with React and common tooling like React Testing Library.
* Past experience on developer experience teams or related tools.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
