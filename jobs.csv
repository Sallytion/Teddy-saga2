 We’re a stealth startup building an AI native platform that feels like a real companion for professionals. Not a chatbot with a nice UI. Something that actually thinks with you.
 



  





 We’re exploring agentic workflows, personalised reasoning layers, dynamic memory systems, and fast backend services that make the whole experience feel effortless.
 



  





 The company is early and the team is intentionally small.
 



 Everyone here shapes the product. Everyone here shapes the engineering culture. If you want a place where your work isn’t a feature buried in a roadmap but something that changes how the product behaves, this is that kind of role.
 



 You’ll be part of the founding software engineering team driving everything needed to take the product live.
 



  





**The Role** 




 We’re looking for a senior backend engineer who enjoys building intelligent systems from the ground up. Someone who can take a complicated idea, break it down, and ship something clean, fast, and reliable.
 



 You’ll build the core backend that powers our AI agents, reasoning loops, orchestration layers, vector pipelines, and the API surface that all clients rely on.
 



  





 If you like end\\-to\\-end ownership, fast decision cycles, and touching systems that haven’t been built before, you’ll feel at home here.
 



  





**What You'll Own** 



* Build and scale backend services using Java (Spring Boot) and Python
* Design and implement LLM powered workflows including agents, orchestration logic, memory layers, embeddings, retrieval pipelines
* Work deeply with vector databases like Weaviate and Qdrant
* Build APIs and event based components that keep the system responsive and predictable
* Set the quality bar for testing, observability, reliability and clean documentation
* Own deployments on AWS using EKS, EC2, S3, IAM and CloudWatch
* Shape CI/CD pipelines, security checks, and Terraform infrastructure
* Help guide architectural decisions as we move from prototype to first release to scale



  





 This is a role where you don’t wait for a ticket. You see the problem, understand the context, and build the solution.
 



  





**What We're Looking For** 



* 5–10\\+ years of backend engineering experience
* Strong experience with Java and Spring Boot
* Strong proficiency in Python
* Solid hands\\-on work with LLMs, agents, or advanced prompt engineering
* Understanding of RAG pipelines, embeddings, vector stores
* Experience with Kafka, Redis, Postgres or MongoDB
* Hands\\-on work with AWS or Azure plus Docker and Kubernetes
* Experience building production grade microservices
* Comfortable using AI assisted dev tools like Copilot, Cursor or Windsurf



  





 We value clarity, craft and speed. If you bring those, we’ll love working with you.
 



  





**Nice to Have** 



* Startup zero to one experience
* Experience mentoring or guiding teammates
* Understanding of event driven or domain driven design
* Experience integrating backend services with mobile apps



  





**Why This Role Matters** 




  





 You’ll be at the center of building a real AI native product, not a wrapper or a copy of something that exists.
 



 You’ll help define how our agents think, reason and execute.
 



 You’ll influence architecture, product direction and the cultural DNA of the engineering team.
 



  





 And you’ll have meaningful equity because the goal is simple: build long term wealth together, not chase short term comfort.
 



  





 If you’re excited by the idea of creating something new with a small team that ships fast and thinks boldly, let’s talk.","Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/stealth-startupsssss","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C510BAQHzVMHO2vjOnQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630575305777/stealth_startupsssss_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=VwGAeg44UBtuYu5RpnCYnZA9iG_XH2rTguk_iSMNvt0","","","","","","","","","","",""
