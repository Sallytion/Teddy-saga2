 Faster onboarding for new countries and partners, reduced manual interventions, and measurable improvements in customer satisfaction and retention.



**Required Qualifications**



* **7\\-10 years** 
 of experience building large\\-scale, distributed systems in
 **high\\-compliance or high\\-integrity domains** 
 (HR, Payroll, FinTech, or Insurance).
* Deep expertise in
 **domain\\-driven design** 
 ,
 **data modeling** 
 , and
 **compliance\\-first architecture** 
 .
* Experience
 **scaling complex regulatory or multi\\-tenant systems** 
 , ideally spanning employment, benefits, or HR platforms.
* Proficiency in designing
 **extensible, modular service boundaries** 
 that maintain
 **auditability and backward compatibility** 
 .
* Strong understanding of
 **policy enforcement, rule engines, and event\\-driven systems** 
 .
* Ability to translate
 **legal and operational complexity** 
 into
 **elegant, maintainable engineering abstractions** 
 .
* A
 **hands\\-on architectural leader** 
 who can set technical direction, mentor teams, and drive large\\-scale transformations sustainably.



**Bonus Points**



* Experience with
 **compliance\\-as\\-code** 
 or
 **policy automation** 
 frameworks.
* Exposure to
 **global employment** 
 ,
 **EOR** 
 , or
 **multi\\-country workforce** 
 systems.
* Familiarity with
 **event sourcing** 
 ,
 **CQRS** 
 , and

* Valued among the
 **fastest\\-growing SaaS companies** 
 in history
* Built at the core of Rippling’s HR foundation, where
 **global employment, compliance, and workforce management** 
 come together as one seamless system.

 ,
 **builds winning systems, and moves fast with conviction.**","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/rippling","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGVw6UsjqtXGw/company-logo_100_100/B4EZlN73QeHIAQ-/0/1757949162831/rippling_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=_-PZ3E8XmdCyc89UhLvip3soyI97bY1FRM89cZYXEiQ","","","","","","","","","","",""
