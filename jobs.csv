**What We Expect From You** 



* **You are a System Breaker:** 
 You don't just test features; you look for ways the system might fail under stress.
* **You Think Like a Developer:** 
 You can read code to understand where the bugs are likely hiding.
* **You are a Quality Advocate:** 
 You are comfortable challenging implementations when quality or user experience is at risk.
* **You are AI\\-Curious:** 
 You stay updated on the latest in LLMs and agentic frameworks.
