 This position is within a project with one of the foundational LLM companies. The goal is to assist these foundational LLM companies in enhancing their Large Language Models.
 



 One way we help these companies improve their models is by providing them with high\\-quality proprietary data. This data serves two main purposes: first, as a basis for fine\\-tuning their models, and second, as an evaluation set to benchmark the performance of their models or competitor models.
 



 For example, for SFT data generation, you might have to put together or be provided a prompt which contains provided code and questions, you will then provide the model responses, and write corresponding Swift code to solve the questions.
 



 For RLHF data generation, you may need to create a prompt yourself or use one provided by the customer, ask the model questions, and evaluate the outputs generated by two versions of the LLM. You'll compare these outputs and provide feedback, which is then used to fine\\-tune the models. Please note that this role does not involve building or fine\\-tuning LLMs.

 What We’re Looking For
 



 Strong experience developing Windows desktop applications, using PowerBASIC.
 



 Comfort working in large, monolithic codebases
 



 Excellent debugging and analytical skills
 



 Ability to learn and work effectively in older systems that may lack modern tooling or documentation
 



 Strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate with distributed teams
 



  





**Nice to Have** 




 Experience with tax software, tax preparation processes, financial systems, or other regulated domains
 



 Familiarity with IRS\\-certified platforms or compliance\\-driven applications
 



 Knowledge of older Windows APIs or desktop frameworks
 



 Prior experience maintaining long\\-lived commercial software products
 



 Why You Might Like This Role
