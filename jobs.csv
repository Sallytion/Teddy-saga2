**About Stripe**
 Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.
   

  

**About The Team**
 Verification \\& Identity Platform (VIP) is a core platform team which powers user onboarding \\& verification (KYC \\& KYB) worldwide \\& ensures continued compliance throughout the merchant life\\-cycle at Stripe. Our team safeguards user identities across our array of digital services, designing and executing a secure, effortless, and user\\-centered identity collection \\& verification environment. Our efforts cover a broad spectrum of identity confirming scenarios, including identity proofing, risk\\-based, and adaptive verification technology. We provide a in\\-house smart orchestration eco system which allows us to integrate with multiple 3P data verification services, financial institutions and regulatory bodies to build accuracy, reliability and speed to verify accounts \\& businesses. We enable Stripe's continued compliance in an ever\\-evolving regulatory landscape by providing infrastructure that automates document collection, verification \\& merchant communication for high scale requirements refresh and accounts remediation programs.
   

  

**You Will**
* Design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and systems across Stripe’s engineering teams
* Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack
* Work with engineers across the company to build new features at large\\-scale
* Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes


 Who you are
   

  

 It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t work on APIs before joining Stripe.
   

  

**Minimum Requirements**
* You have a strong technical background with 7\\-12 years of technical experience building APIs.
* Think about systems and services and write high quality code.
* Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems.
* Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.
* Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts.
* Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, ¼ of Stripes work in a country that’s different from the one they grew up in). Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers, from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers; to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Domain expertise in accounting or financial management is a plus but not at all a requirement


 Hybrid work at Stripe
   

  

 This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35\\+ miles or 56\\+ km from a Stripe office).
   

  

 In\\-office expectations
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.
   

  

 Working remotely at Stripe
   

  

 A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on\\-sites, meet\\-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently live or plan to live.
   

  

 Pay and benefits
   

  

 Stripe does not yet include pay ranges in job postings in every country. Stripe strongly values pay transparency and is working toward pay transparency globally.

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.
   

  

**About The Team**
 Verification \\& Identity Platform (VIP) is a core platform team which powers user onboarding \\& verification (KYC \\& KYB) worldwide \\& ensures continued compliance throughout the merchant life\\-cycle at Stripe. Our team safeguards user identities across our array of digital services, designing and executing a secure, effortless, and user\\-centered identity collection \\& verification environment. Our efforts cover a broad spectrum of identity confirming scenarios, including identity proofing, risk\\-based, and adaptive verification technology. We provide a in\\-house smart orchestration eco system which allows us to integrate with multiple 3P data verification services, financial institutions and regulatory bodies to build accuracy, reliability and speed to verify accounts \\& businesses. We enable Stripe's continued compliance in an ever\\-evolving regulatory landscape by providing infrastructure that automates document collection, verification \\& merchant communication for high scale requirements refresh and accounts remediation programs.
   

  

**You Will**
* Design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and systems across Stripe’s engineering teams
* Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack
* Work with engineers across the company to build new features at large\\-scale
* Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes


 Who you are
   

  

 It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t work on APIs before joining Stripe.
   

  

**Minimum Requirements**
* You have a strong technical background with 7\\-12 years of technical experience building APIs.
* Think about systems and services and write high quality code.
* Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems.
* Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.
* Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts.
* Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, ¼ of Stripes work in a country that’s different from the one they grew up in). Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers, from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers; to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Domain expertise in accounting or financial management is a plus but not at all a requirement
