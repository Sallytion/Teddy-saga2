**Job Description**
 We are looking for a senior, hands\\-on Backend Engineer to build and operate the core AI/ML\\-backed systems that power BharatIQ’s consumer\\-facing products at scale.
   

  

 This is not a role to learn ML fundamentals on the job. You are expected to already have experience shipping and operating ML\\-backed backend systems in production, such as RAG pipelines, search, ranking, recommendations, or AI assistants. The work requires making pragmatic tradeoffs across quality, latency, reliability, and cost in real\\-world systems.
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Build and operate core backend services for AI product runtime: orchestration, state/session, policy enforcement, tools/services integration
* Implement retrieval \\+ memory primitives end\\-to\\-end: chunking, embeddings generation, indexing, vector search, re\\-ranking, caching, freshness and deletion semantics
* Productionize ML workflows and interfaces: feature/metadata services,online/offline parity, model integration contracts, and evaluation instrumentation
* Drive performance and cost optimization (P50/P95 latency, throughput, cache hit rates, token/call cost, infra efficiency) with strong SLO ownership
* Add observability\\-by\\-default: tracing, structured logs, metrics, guardrail signals, failure taxonomy, and reliable fallback paths
* Collaborate with applied ML on model routing, prompt/tool schemas, evaluation datasets, and release safety gates.


**Other Skills**
* 6–10 years building backend systems in production, including at least 2–3 years on ML/AI\\-backed products (search, recommendations, ranking, RAG, or assistants)
* Practical ML chops: able to reason about embeddings, vector similarity, re\\-ranking, retrieval quality, evaluation metrics (precision/recall, nDCG, MRR), and data drift—without needing training
* Experience implementing or operating RAG pipelines (document ingestion,chunking strategies, indexing, query understanding, hybrid retrieval, re\\-rankers)
* Strong distributed systems fundamentals: API design, idempotency, concurrency, rate limiting, retries, circuit breakers, and multi\\-tenant reliability
* Comfort with common ML/AI platform components: feature stores/metadata, streaming/batch pipelines, offline evaluation jobs, A/B measurement hooks
* Ability to ship end\\-to\\-end independently: design → build → deploy → operate in a fast\\-moving environment


**Nice to have**
* Agentic runtime / tool\\-calling patterns, function calling schemas, structured outputs, safety/guardrails in productio
* Prior work with FAISS / Milvus / Pinecone / Elasticsearch hybrid retrieval, and model serving stacks
* Kubernetes \\+ observability stack depth (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus/Grafana, distributed tracing), plus privacy controls for user data


**Educational Qualifications**
* Bachelor’s or Master’s in Computer Science, Data Science, or related fields.
* Equivalent practical experience building and operating large\\-scale backend and ML\\-backed systems will be considered in place of formal education.
* Advanced certifications or research exposure in AI/ML/DL is an added advantage.

**The Roku Culture** 

 Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
 



 We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.
