 1\\. We are Financially Broke: We are in a severe financial crisis. We are cash\\-poor. Even the team is mainly working unpaid to survive.

 3\\. The Pay is Low: We can't pay you a fancy salary right now.

 1\\. ""All\\-In"" Pro\\-Gamer Mindset Only hire the hungry, the desperate, and the obsessed who dedicate their life to winning the game.
 



 2\\. Equal Pay for Equal Performance Refuse to discriminate based on location; compensation is determined 100% by value, never by a passport.
 



 3\\. Exponential Rewards (Rank System) Compensation is based on a Rank System (Bronze to Grandmaster); pay skyrockets based on impact, ranging from unpaid to Silicon Valley levels.
 



 4\\. Radical Meritocracy Ignore degree, age, nationality, or use of AI; care about only one thing: ""Can you create actual KPI?""

**📌 Position Details** 




  





 • Job Title: Software Engineer Intern
 



 • Employment type: Full\\-time, Remote
 



 • Starting Salary: $0 \\~ $300 USD / month
 



 • Location: Everywhere
 



 • AI tools can be provided
 



  





 🎯
 **Responsibilities** 




  





 1\\. Rapid Prototyping (Ship in Hours): Don't over\\-engineer. We need features TODAY. Build dirty, fast prototypes to test ideas instantly.
 



 2\\. Visual Bridge (Dev \\<\\-\\> Design): You are the bridge. Build interactive 3D demos to help the Product \\& Design teams visualize their ideas instantly. Your prototype answers the question: ""Is this fun?""
 



 3\\. ""Throwaway"" Code: Your code is for validation, not production. Don't worry about clean architecture. The core Dev team will re\\-develop it properly later. Your job is to make it work on\\-screen NOW.
 



 4\\. Master Three.js (No Excuses): You will use Three.js daily. If you don't know it, you must learn it while you work. You cannot avoid it; you must manipulate meshes and textures to prove concepts.
 



 5\\. Aggressive AI Leverage: Don't write boilerplate manually. Use ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot to write 80% of the code. We judge you by speed, not by how hard you type.
 



  





**✅ Requirements** 




  





 1\\. JS/TS \\& React (Three.js Will): You must be proficient in JavaScript or TypeScript and React. While expert\\-level Three.js is not required to start, you must have the relentless will to learn it. You are expected to ship 3D prototypes from Day 1\\.
 



 2\\. High Communication Skills: This is not a solo coding job. You must be able to discuss abstract concepts (UI flow, 3D logic, user experience) with Designers and Product Owners in English. If you cannot explain your logic clearly, you cannot work here.
 



 3\\. Extreme Learning Curve: You must be confident you can grasp the basics of 3D web development in 3 days using AI and documentation. ""I don't know how"" is not an excuse.
 



 4\\. ""War\\-Time"" Hunger: We need people who are desperate to prove their coding skills and grow.
 



 5\\. Autonomy: 100% self\\-managed. We measure prototypes shipped, not hours.
 



 6\\. Basic Infrastructure: You need a laptop that can handle 3D development and a stable internet connection.
 



  





**🌟 Preferred** 




  





 1\\. Heavy Gamer / Social Media Addict: You spend hours on Games (Roblox, VRChat, LoL) or Social Media (TikTok, Discord). You understand what makes a digital interface ""addictive.""
 



 2\\. Digital Native Socializer: You have experience making real friends online (without meeting them in person). You understand the ""Adler Vision"" intuitively because you have lived it.
 



 3\\. Speed Demon: You value ""Running Code"" over ""Clean Code."" You prefer shipping a working prototype today over a perfect architecture next week.
 



 4\\. Design\\-Centric Developer: You understand what ""UX"" means. You don't just code logic; you care about how it
 *feels* 
 to the user.
 



 5\\. AI Freak: You use AI coding assistants for everything. You are lazy, so you automate your coding workflow.
 



 6\\. Detachment: You don't fall in love with your code. You are okay with your code being deleted and rewritten by the core team after validation.
 



 7\\. Chaos Survivor: Early\\-stage startup experience. You don't panic when the requirements change 5 times a day.
 



 8\\. Game Dev Spirit: You have experience with Unity/Unreal or web game development. You understand the ""Game Loop.""
 



 9\\. Thick Skin: You love harsh feedback from Designers. You don't cry when they say ""change this""; you just change it.
