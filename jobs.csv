Come help us build the world's best fully managed and self\\-optimizing data lake platform!
   

  

**The Community You Will Join**
 When you join Onehouse, you're joining a team of passionate professionals tackling the deeply technical challenges of building a 2\\-sided engineering product. Our engineering team serves as the bridge between the worlds of open source and enterprise: contributing directly to and growing Apache Hudi (already used at scale by global enterprises like Uber, Amazon, ByteDance etc) and concurrently defining a new industry category \\- the transactional data lake. The Cloud Infrastructure team is the glue that binds all of this together. We enable our data platform and infrastructure teams to be successful by acting as the foundation of a truly cloud native product.
   

  

**The Impact You Will Drive:**
* As a backend engineer at Onehouse, you will get to build highly scalable and extremely reliable platform services, solving deep technical challenges across all of these areas. These distributed systems will be critical to supporting our multi region cloud microservices at scale.


**A Typical Day:**

**Keep Making It Better Always**
*Rome was not built in a day; If we can get 1% better each day for one year, we'll end up thirty\\-seven times better. This means being organized, communicating promptly, taking even small tasks seriously, tracking all small ideas, and paying it forward.*
**Think Big, Act Fast**
*We have tremendous scope for innovation, but we will still be judged by impact over time. Big, bold ideas still need to be strategized against priorities, broken down, set in rapid motion, measure, refine, repeat. Great execution is what separates promising companies from proven unicorns.*
**Be Customer Obsessed**
*Everyone has the responsibility to drive towards the best experience for the customer, be an OSS user or a paid customer. If something is broken, own it, say something, do something; never ignore. Be the change that you want to see in the company.*
 We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.
