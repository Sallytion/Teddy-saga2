* Identify, record, document thoroughly and track bugs
* Perform thorough regression testing when bugs are resolved
* Work with cross\\-functional teams to ensure quality throughout the software development process
* Active participation in dedicated automation work for framework enhancements and test additions
* Work closely with product teams and development teams in feature launches



**Why Join Us:** 




 It is rare to have a company that both deeply impacts its customers and is able to provide its services across a massive population.  At Blink, we have a huge impact on people when they are most vulnerable: at the intersection of their healthcare and finances. We are also the fastest growing healthcare company in the country and are driving that impact across millions of new patients every year.  Our business model not only helps people, but drives economics that allow us to build a generational company. We are a relentlessly learning, constantly curious, and aggressively collaborative cross\\-functional team dedicated to inventing new ways to improve the lives of our customers.

**Our Operating Principles**
***Extreme Ownership***
 We take full responsibility for our work, outcomes, and team success. No excuses, no blame\\-shifting — if something needs fixing, we own it and make it better. This means stepping up, even when it’s not “your job.” If a ball is dropped, we pick it up. If a customer is unhappy, we fix it. If a process is broken, we redesign it. We don’t wait for someone else to solve it — we lead with accountability and expect the same from those around us.
   

  

***Craftsmanship***
 Putting care and intention into every task, striving for excellence, and taking deep ownership of the quality and outcome of your work. Craftsmanship means never settling for “just fine.” We sweat the details because details compound. Whether it’s a product feature, an internal doc, or a sales call — we treat it as a reflection of our standards. We aim to deliver jaw\\-dropping customer experiences by being curious, meticulous, and proud of what we build — even when nobody’s watching.
   

  

***We are “majos”***
 Be friendly \\& have fun with your coworkers. Always be genuine \\& honest, but kind. “Majo” is our way of saying: be a good human. Be approachable, helpful, and warm. We’re building something ambitious, and it’s easier (and more fun) when we enjoy the ride together. We give feedback with kindness, challenge each other with respect, and celebrate wins together without ego.
   

  

***Urgency with Focus***
 Create the highest impact in the shortest amount of time. Move fast, but in the right direction. We operate with speed because time is our most limited resource. But speed without focus is chaos. We prioritize ruthlessly, act decisively, and stay aligned. We aim for high leverage: the biggest results from the simplest, smartest actions. We’re running a high\\-speed marathon — not a sprint with no strategy.
   

  

***Talent Density and Meritocracy***
 Hire only people who can raise the average; ‘exceptional performance is the passing grade.’ Ability trumps seniority. We believe the best teams are built on talent density — every hire should raise the bar. We reward contribution, not titles or tenure. We give ownership to those who earn it, and we all hold each other to a high standard. A\\-players want to work with other A\\-players — that’s how we win.
   

  

***First\\-Principles Thinking***
 Strip a problem to physics\\-level facts, ignore industry dogma, rebuild the solution from scratch. We don’t copy\\-paste solutions. We go back to basics, ask why things are the way they are, and rebuild from the ground up if needed. This mindset pushes us to innovate, challenge stale assumptions, and move faster than incumbents. It’s how we build what others think is impossible.","Software Development","https://www.linkedin.com/company/happyrobot","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQHA7jbVAxkZXQ/company-logo_100_100/B4EZgXYt9RHIAQ-/0/1752739012753/happyrobot_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=YWYpmny8MB1rI30LevYq33Zy6s7zfIbK-Hl_sq-W9ZU","","","","","","","","","","",""

 Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.
   

  

 Since 2012, we have built the market\\-leading cloud security company and an award\\-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Paris, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive. Visit us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter@Netskope.
   

  

**About The Role**
*Please note, this team is hiring across all levels and candidates are individually assessed and appropriately leveled based upon their skills and experience.*
 Join Netskope’s Cloud Data Plane team — building one of the world’s fastest, most intelligent in\\-line inspection engines, processing 10\\+ Gbps of traffic at line rate.
   

  

 In this defining role, you’ll
 **architect and build a Domain\\-Specific Language (DSL)** 
 and its
 **complete compiler toolchain** 
 for our next\\-gen CASB Inline platform, enabling highly efficient policy and signature execution.
   

  

**What’s In It For You**
 In this role you will be a key member of the NG\\-SWG team supporting our in\\-line CASB and SWG products, both of which have been recognized by Gartner as market leaders in their Magic Quadrant reports:
   

  

 Netskope SWG in Gartner 2022 SSE Magic Quadrant
   

  

 Netskope CASB in Gartner 2022 SSE Magic Quadrant
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Define the grammar, syntax, and semantics for a new security\\-focused DSL.
* Design and implement the full compiler pipeline – parser, AST, type checker, semantic analyzer, IR, and code generator.
* Develop advanced compiler optimizations and tune runtime performance for high\\-throughput, low\\-latency execution.
* Own the end\\-to\\-end lifecycle — from architecture and prototyping to deployment and long\\-term evolution.
* Mentor engineers and drive the technical roadmap for language and compiler systems across the CASB/SWG platform.
* Collaborate with product, research, and platform teams to ensure seamless integration into Netskope’s security stack.


**Required Experience**
* 12\\+ years of software development experience with 3\\+ years in a Staff/Principal architecture role.
* Proven expertise in compiler design, language theory, and systems programming (C\\+\\+, Rust, Go, or Python).
* Strong background in parser frameworks (ANTLR, LLVM, Yacc/Bison).
* Hands\\-on with runtime performance tuning, profiling, and low\\-level memory management.
* Demonstrated success owning large\\-scale, high\\-performance systems from design to production.
* Excellent technical communication and leadership skills.


**Preferred Qualifications**
* Experience contributing to or maintaining open\\-source compiler or language projects.
* Familiarity with functional programming paradigms.
