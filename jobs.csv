**Type:** 
 Permanent
   

  

**Role Summary**
 We are seeking an experienced and innovative
 **R\\&D Specialist** 
 with a strong background in
 **Generative AI (GenAI)** 
 and complementary expertise in
 **Computer Vision** 
 and
 **Predictive Modeling** 
 in the
 **Retail and Consumer space** 
 . The ideal candidate will drive the research, design, and prototyping of AI\\-based solutions that push the boundaries of
 **industrial applications, digital twins, and autonomous systems** 
 .
   

  

**Key Responsibilities**
* Lead and contribute to applied research in Generative AI, including LLMs, Vision\\-Language Models (VLMs), Multimodal AI, and Prompt Engineering.
* Collaborate with product and engineering teams to translate GenAI research into real\\-world use cases for industries like manufacturing, automotive, oil \\& gas, and healthcare.
* Conduct R\\&D in Traditional AI domains such as:
+ Computer Vision: object detection, segmentation, OCR
+ Predictive Analytics: RUL, anomaly detection, forecasting

* Build and evaluate AI models using tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, LangChain, OpenCV, Scikit\\-learn, etc.
* Publish internal white papers, IP disclosures, and present research outcomes to leadership and stakeholders.


**Required Skills \\& Experience**
* 7–12 years of hands\\-on experience in AI/ML R\\&D, including a minimum of 2–3 years in GenAI.
* Strong experience with LLMs: fine\\-tuning, model evaluation, vector databases, and inference pipelines.
* Deep expertise in at least one traditional domain:
+ Computer Vision (e.g., CNNs, YOLO, Mask R\\-CNN) OR
+ Predictive Modeling (e.g., time\\-series, survival models).

* Experience deploying models in Edge/Cloud/MLOps pipelines and working with enterprise data platforms.
* Strong programming skills in Python with experience in notebook\\-based prototyping, REST APIs, and ML libraries.


**Good To Have / Preferred**
* Knowledge of Agentic AI, Digital Twins, or Simulation\\-based learning.
* Experience in industrial AI domains (e.g., smart factory, quality inspection, predictive maintenance).
* Exposure to generative vision models like Diffusion Models, GANs, or NeRFs.
* Experience collaborating in multidisciplinary R\\&D teams.
* Contributions to open\\-source, patents, or publications in AI/ML.
